    "review":"excellent all around  had the fried chicken and waffles  yum yumMy husband and I visited Grand Trunk Saloon last night a Saturday and were pretty disappointed We waited about 30 minutes for a table which was no problem We ordered drinks while we waited Unfortunately we never received the drinks while we were waiting and it wasnt until after we were seated at our table that we were informed they had run out of the wine we ordered Okay we ordered a different one We ordered hushpuppies to start We order these at every Southern restaurant we go to and while they took 40 minutes to arrive they were amazing Super crispy outside and really good dipping sauce This had us really excited for the rest of the meal The mains arrived not too long after we ordered the brisket and the chicken and waffles to share You could just look at the brisket and know it wasnt going to taste good It was basically inedible if you have ever had a good brisket It was served on white bread which is traditionally meant to be used for sopping up the extra sauce and moistureno need for it on this plate thats for sure We were surprised they actually served it kind of embarrassing I enjoyed the chicken and waffles however one of the waffles was undercooked and extremely soggy Wish I could give this more stars but the quality of the food and the service simply doesnt match the pricingI really enjoyed my experience at this place I was a little skeptical wen I first arrived as the lights were way too bright and the decor was a little cheesy But our waitress was an absolute doll Her name was Molly and she was so attentive and helpful They were out of the wine we wanted but she suggested an alternative that went really well with our chicken and waffles The food was good but the service was why Ill be back to this spot"

    "review":"The people who work there were quite friendly and the food was great Definitely will visit againWe ordered delivery and several parts of the order were either missing or wrong The food itself was fine but I wouldnt go back before trying a different placeMy girlfriend and a friend of ours decided to try SOS BBQ tonight and overall we were very impressed We ordered four of the different meats to try Brisket pulled pork pulled chicken and pulled rib The chicken was absolutely fantastic and so were the pulled ribs I highly recommend the All In sauce The pulled pork was a little dry but still quite good However we were a bit disappointed in the sliced brisket They charge an extra 2 for it but it was pretty dry and lacked flavour compared to the Lancaster Smokehouse it didnt hold a candle We got fries onion rings  and mac n cheese as sides I have to say the fries may be the best fries Ive ever eaten and the other sides were great as well We could have some false advertising on the cornbread It isnt really cornbread and I dont recommend adding it to any orders Its very light and taste more like a cupcake it doesnt seem to have any corn in it at allAll in all well likely come back for take out For dine in Ill stick to the Lancaster SmokehouseMy mom and I went to SOS BBQ for lunch  We had the pulled pork poutine and Nathans hotdogs with onion rings  I was impressed by the service The employees were very helpful and knowledgeable  They assisted us in making our food choices and offered us their daily lunch specials They continued to check in us throughout our meal and were quite courteous  Todays lunch special were ribs  They looked so delicious and were a great price  The food comes in very generous servings  We were very full  The onion rings were amazing So light and fluffy with just enough batter The poutine was one of the best I had eaten  A must for great comfort food  We will be back for sureThe meat was tasty but I didnt find it any better than your average BBQ place The serving sizes were disappointing for what you pay I had the pulled pork sandwich combo and was still hungry after  I had the Mac and cheese for a side was was very disappointed Not at all what I was expecting and very dull in the flavour department Not very cheesy either Service was lovely kind and knowledgeable Overall I would say  mediocre Not terrible but not great eitherIve sampled the menu here quite extensively and I have yet to be disappointed My favourites have to be the pulled pork with Carolina sauce and the ribs The sauces here are amazing and really make the meal Its nice to find pulled pork that isnt the soupy crock pot version you mind most places The sides dishes are exemplary great coleslaw and amazing Brunswick stewThis isnt a fancy sit down restaurant its a roadside BBQ joint with tables and that suits me just fine Dont expect cloth napkins and wine at your table Its about the food here not the ambianceAs to the reviewer who complained his ribs werent precut suck it up princess I have never had such tender ribs and they pull apart with the greatest of ease Maybe you should stick to one of the chain restaurants"

    "review":"Ive enjoyed Shawerma Plus in the past Recently I had a really bad experience The portions were terrible I ordered the Meat Platter and received five slivers of meat on top of a bed of soggy french fries I paid thirty dollars for something that looked nothing like what was advertised and I was not impressed Its such a shame because this place has done so much for the community and has in the past always been such a good quality restaurantI got the chicken shawarma plate with extra hot sauce fattoush and rice as the sides The chicken was very flavourful The hot sauce was not hot at all in my opinion actually Id prefer it with more heat and the creamy garlic sauce was too rich for me it really tastes like mayo The fattoush was great with the fried pita chips I found it quite refreshing after the rich garlic sauce Its more expensive compared to other places but the quality you get is much better I will definitely go back for more delicious shawarma but next time I think I need to ask for less garlic sauce and extra extra hot sauceOrdered the chicken shawarma combo which comes with fries and a drink  comes to just under 10 Its a pretty filling meal and the shawarma is very tasty One of my biggest gripes is that they only give 1 ketchup pack which is not enough for the fries When I asked for additional ketchup I was still only given 1 until I asked for more Other than that the service is really nice and theyre very friendly from the moment you step foot insideService is nice and friendly Football is playing on a large flatscreen TV on one of the walls Food there is good but prices are on the high side Had a chicken shawarma combo with drink and fries and I found the shawarma to be on the small side for 869 wish I could order it by itself Many of the meals are in the 12  15 range so this place is not just for fast foodReally good Shawerma  Nice large servings of all the side dishes  My wife an I both got the takeout Chicken Shawerma with Rice and Fatoush  The Fatoush salad was authentic and amazing  It had those fried pita bits that are supposed to be in Fatoush but a lot of places skip these  They gave us both garlic and Tahini in a seperate container with a fresh pita  The true test of good Shawerma is being given so much food youre not able to finish and I was notI had a plate of chicken shwarma and curry rice with a side of salad The plus side is that the chicken and rice were simply amazing I think their chicken is probably one of the best Ive had so far in KW and the rice was seasoned well and fluffyHOWEVER the reason I am giving this place only three stars is because the salad they served me tasted like it was dressed with pure lemon juice It was so acidic the top of my mouth still burns NOT cool I think they just forgot to add sugar to their dressing or something because I did not taste any hint of sweetness I will be returning but probably wont order the salad again"

    "review":"This review is solely for the Optometrist office of Costco  Not to be confused with the Optical departmentI will preface by saying that the Optical department is actually quite awesome  They are fast and friendly and quite knowledgeable  No issues thereHOWEVERI made an appointment with the Optometrist department to have a checkup  I happened to arrive really early so I poked my head in to see if there was a possibility that they could take me sooner than my appointment in hopes of saving their and my time  Unfortunately I was huffed at by the ohsopleasant receptionist I will discuss her in a moment and told to come back at my scheduled time  Fine no problem to me Ill just do some walking around inside Costco to kill timeSo I return to the Optometrist office  on time mind you  and have the pretest completed by the receptionist  Im not sure why they let her do it since she cant or doesnt know how to do it right because she told me shed have to get the Optometrist to do it for her  Now the good part  Im inside the room getting my checkup and the Optometrist puts some drops in my eyes at the end and instructs me to wait five minutes in the waiting room and shell bring me back in to finish up  She brings me back in after five minutes finishes up and Im good to go  I get two steps outside the door when my husband whom was accompanying me told me that while I was being examined by the Optometrist the receptionist was LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION WITH HER EAR PRESSED TO THE DOOR  My husband was extremely uncomfortable with that and he suggested to her to not listen to our conversation and she blatantly replied I am privileged to listen to their conversation  I turned right around and went back into the office and confronted the receptionist with this information who admitted to having listened with her ear to the door  WOWId like to mention that her actions were likely due to the fact that she wanted to be done early as clearly displayed by her ear to the door perhaps to see if we would be done soon lunch bag and purse neatly packed up sitting on top of the desk tapping her nails and my husband said the driver of her ride waiting outside had come in and checked to see if she would be done soon  Please think twice before using the Optometrist office  The receptionist might be listening to youCalled costco asking for a price on a 5 cubic foot freezer The customer service rep asked for the product codeI did not have a code so she told me next time is should have a codeSo I felt really stupidThen she said there is none in stock I replied and said I think Ive seen some there She said thats a 51 cubic foot model and I asked for a 5I felt stupid twiceI then asked for the price She replied 200 with a annoyed voiceI asked her 200 because Ive never seen anything on sale for 200 exactlyShe replied 200I dont know how costco can hire such a rude CSR I dont feel like going backThis is in reference to eco water only Eco water is the subcontractor costco uses to sell and install home water systems Good systemsbut very expensive 7000 for a water softener and a ro installed We were in need and were sold on the product so we gave our information andthey set the date to install was about four or five days after we said go They asked me if i could be there for the install because of certain detailsso i cancelled all my appointments for that day The night before the install michael called me I missed his call at first but called right back and got an answering service They said michael wanted me to fax in a proof of income statement that evening so they can continue  I told the lady i was at a Xmas party and would not be home till very late She said hold on and called michael then got back on the phone with me and said the job was being canceled BAD BUSINESS  I was looking forward to it too Justin drake 805 310 6237This is our local Costco store There are larger Costco stores out there but it is a good size for our area We have found that the store has great selection for the size of the store You need a membership to shop at this store and it costs 55 a year for the membership plus HST My wife and I have the executive membership which is more expensive but gives a 2 cash back We have found that this works well for us as the reward is greater than the amount that we pay extra for the executive membership which is 100 plus HST The staff is friendly and helpful and have always been attentive and answered all my questions There are times when the store is very busy and there is a long line up for the cashier to check out There is a tire centre at this location and they also refill propane at the tire centre which is competitively priced There is also a pharmacy at this store as well There is also a deli and we have purchased excellent catering platters from this location Finally there is a fast food restaurant in the store and you can get a hot dog and a drink for only 199 plus HST What I like most about Costco is that they stand behind their products and have always answered any questions I had with my purchases You can returns items that you have purchased no questions asked This even extends to their memberships which you can get refunded at any timewent to get my eye glasses at costco the price is unbeatable except sears are having huge sale on glasses lately completely satisfied with my new glasses it took 6 calendar days to be made"

    "review":"I dont know why this place has such bad reviews but my past experiences here werent how others described Food is decent although I havent tried the sushi Nor do I think I ever will just because I wont eat sushi unless its at a japanese restaurant Drinks were not bad but I do think youre better off going to sweet dreams which is a 3 minute walk away One thing that I do have to mention is that you shouldnt expect great service here Ive came here 4 times in 2 weeks I wouldnt trust the sushi only because its not a japanese restaurant I did enjoy the tong yum kung seafood ramen which is pretty good in my opinion Its hard for me to find a tong yum kung soup base that I enjoy Ive been to many thai restaurants that have disappointed me and was pleasantly surprised by the taste very authentic I agree that its not the best ramen but I got lots of seafood at least 5 shrimpsI also tried the udon  tempura I did find the soup base salty though but the price rivals that of MrSushis daily specials Tempura was decent The takoyaki was good and for the price Im paying I enjoyed it even more Kenzo charges 1000 for 6pcs and Im only paying 399 here The roasted milk tea with grass jelly was good You could taste that it was roasted well but the grass jelly could have been cut thinner It was just a large chunkOn the multiple occasions that Ive been here Ive always thought the service could be better The wait to be seated is usually long because no one acknowledges you really Was tempted to seat ourselves a couple of times When we came here last night they ran out of caps for the water jug and didnt give us a lemon in the water In addition I felt that wed usually have to call someone over when we wanted anything Overall food is decentgood Service could be better But this place is very affordable 899 for a teriyaki tofu and it comes with a lot of things  ice creamIve been here twice food is not that great I tried the sushi combo and the second time the BBQ pork ramenI dont recommend the BBQ Pork Ramen the pork was dry and the broth was tasteless The sushi combo is okayThe food was okay but the service was super slow My friends and I ordered one entree each and there are only three of us The food did not come at the same time which was a little strange The spicy ramen soup was a little too spicy that I couldnt taste much other things The lunch took almost two hours so I wouldnt recommend this place if you want something quick They do not accept credit cardsSince the restaurant opened it became my favorite restaurant near campus Why The food tastes excellent the prices are fair the portions are large the ambiance is cool and the service is fast and friendly I tried their ramen their sushi their rice sets their fried rice and their drinks and everything was good My favorite: fresh fruit slush Dragon fruit flavor and kiwi flavor are the best Add some toppings to itFor ramen you can add extra noodle for free And sometimes the restaurant distributes ice cream or salad for free Plus if you pay cash you get discounts I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone especially studentsGood place for a quick sushi fix Interesting sushi rolls at an affordable price  Had the Red Dragon and Black Dragon rolls which were quite tasty The portions are huge definitely share it with friends and you can try out different flavours too Comes with complimentary red bean ice cream which was pretty awesomeDecent food overall had the ricebento boxes mostly and they are well flavoured and filling Service was horrible 35 times I went so beware of that took up to 30 mins to get our food on the table after being seated"

    "review":"Food was good and I would go to Martinis again  I am a fan of steak and Prime Rib and the Beef Dip sandwich did not disappoint  Would have liked to try the steaks but at the time was not hungry enough for a full course dinner When ordering the sandwich and requested mediumrare I was impressed that the waitress let us know that the mediumrare was just that and very pink Not all waitresses are that knowledgeable on the food they serve  The prime rib in the sandwich was excellent but not so for the fries served with my hubbys sandwich  The Yukon Gold fresh cut fries were soggy and grossly overcooked  I had the Cesar salad on the side with mine which was wonderfully fresh but slightly bland the waitress brought some lemon wedges which improved the salad   We shared an order of esgargot and they were done to perfection in butter and crusted with cheese  They have a better than average amount of beers on tap and we both ordered Heineken  Hubby got his immediately ordered when I was in the ladies room and when I ordered I waited quite a long time as the Keg needed to be changedThe restaurant has a nice contemporary atmosphere and one of the nicest bathrooms around  I did not like the big screens with hockey but sure the hockey fans appreciate it  It seemed to distract from the ambiance  I recommend this restaurant and will go again and try the steaksWould definitely back for brunch Portions are the perfect size  not so huge that youve just had three days worth of calories in one meal The waffles are great  light and made fresh Great service  our server was fast personable and friendlyOverpriced overrated Their pad Thai is different alrightchow mein noodlesHere for drinks only and those were good and the few appetizers tasty Somewhat on the pricy side but the atmosphere and service were as expected The staff are attentive and friendlyBeen a couple of times nowonce hosting a group of eight Drinks are good and the service friendly and engaging Menu needs some updatingI go here for late night dinners from time to time  Its an upper scale casual experience and the food is slightly above roadhouse value  The thing that this organization tends to thrive at is customer service whenever our experience is compromised they cater to ensure your experience is positive  I would recommend this place as a great late night meal experience  One thing to mention the menu has limited options"

    "review":"We were excited about visiting a brand new seemingly authentic Mexican restaurant but were unfortunately met with disappointment  First impressions were positive  the restaurant was decently decorated the food at other tables looked colourful and yummy My spouse and I waited for a few seconds and were approached by the waitress who looked incredibly bored or rushed and asked us if we wanted our food to go  Talk about a warm welcome We told her wed like to eat in wandered to a table and eventually made our orderOnce our orders came out I had to wait for couple of minutes then hail down the waitress to ask for cutlery  She came back with only one set  She mustve realized this was silly and came by a minute later with another  The food itself was incredibly bland The side of corn nachos was sadly the best part for me covered with a skimpy amount of salsa that didnt have any spicy or limey notesnothing interesting  I ordered a shrimp burrito that was packed full of cool bland rice and contained no savoury flavours  My spouse ordered a chimichanga that didnt look like a chimichanga it was a little less bland but still did not offer anything tasty when I took a biteWhen my spouse went up to pay the waitress just stared at him Um sohow much is it he asked  She and another fellow then spent a few minutes calculating our total while we stood there awkwardly the fridge from the old Subscafe prominent in the doorway to their kitchen  Talk about unprofessional  them not knowing what we even ordered and failing to cover up the blatant fact that their restaurant scavenged equipment from the old business in their locationI thought about going back again one time but they were closed  In the middle of the day on a weekday  They dont have their hours postedJust skip this restaurant and go to the bar next door Im sure their quesadilla packs a more flavourful punch for cheaper and friendlier atmosphere than the cold near cardboard wraps we ate at the dull Tres ChilesThis is the only place Ive found in Canada that serves the same size of burritos Ive found in California enormous The burrito is pretty tasty but not what Id call authentic It seemed very CanadianAmerican which isnt always a bad thing The burrito meal comes with chips and a dipping sauce I thought it was pretty good valueThe nachos were also very tasty Standard toppings cheese lettuce jalapenosI also tried Tamal de Elote and Papusas but found that they were more on the bland side The Tamal especially It was also kind of soggy To be fair Ive never tried these things before so I cant be too critical It might just be that Im not a fan of these foods rather than them being made poorlyI love the food Delicious and authentic  Great local food and great value  We get takeout often and its super fast  The staff is friendlyThis is my goto place in Waterloo region for authentic Mexican foodPrices are quite reasonable and portion sizes are generousThe burritos are large and flavourful enchiladas and taquitos are delicious and their tacos are tastyIve never had a bad dish at Tres Chiles and neither have my friendsMy only complaint is their lack of a proper hot sauce  They brought me out what they call their hot sauce but it had little heat to it at all  I expect authentic Mexican food to have authentic hot sauce tooThis was by far the best Mexican food I have ever had and that says a lot because mexican is my favourite The food came out hot and fairly quickly and the owner was very attentive and friendlyI would have given it a 5 star rating but they do have a few flaws like the fact that the wife makes certain foods and if she isnt there you cant get it like the Pupusas Also we tried going on a Saturday night and they although they open at 5 for dinner they were a no show that nightI will absolutely go back whenever I canwe LOVED itI ordered a soup and a pupusa the chicken soup was excellent Really soothing and healthy Lots of veggies in it and chicken I reallyyyy liked this soup and so did the rest of the table The pupusa was okay a little undercooked compared to other places Overall I would definitely go back and try more things on the menu Not a fancy place but decent service"

    "review":"Meh Mikeys is alright Hits the spot when you want to grab something quick on the way to campus but the food is pretty thoroughly average I usually just the two item option and honestly theres not too much to say about it Panda King around the corner has the same style and the food tastes slightly better and there are a few other Chinese places in the plaza that are betterProbably the worst Chinese food in the plaza The food in the steam table barely has any flavor and the food portions are smaller than many other chinese places in the plaza Also for some reason every food they serve has a bitter aftertaste which is very unpleasantThis is still my favorite place to get a quick meal near the university Curry noodles regular noodles and sesame chicken are top notch Price is fair Food is delicious I will always visit this place when i am around the schoolI had the salt and pepper pork It you are unfamiliar with this delicacy dont try it here it gives it a bad name Maybe I just I had too high of an expectation Anyway the pork was cut into bite sized pieces for whatever reason and just didnt taste or look authentic So I was pretty down Whats even worse that 85 of my meal was just rice When I finished the pork I literally had nothing left so It came to a point where i was just eating plain rice Now normally you would like equally distribute the food items with the rice but there were just so few pieces I would have been happier with a Panda King mealPerhaps I didnt try their best dish but nothing about the meal is worth a second try and the service wasnt even that friendly 210 Pandascame here many times Big portion size cheap QuickI like the sesame chicken the most The chicken were crunchy and tasty a bit salty However if its the last bits on the food tray it may be a bit soggy Best when its first out of the kitchenThe fried rice was always bland and sometimes soggy Well you pay what you getThe curry fried noodle however was much better  more flavorful and chewy noodle just need to add 060 or more cant remember to change from fried rice to noodleBad thing is that they charge you 50 cent for using credit card But overall Id come back whenever I have to eat at the plazaI came to Mikeys after reading all the good reviews but was left highly disappointed I ordered the lunch special with steamed rice sesame chicken and mixed vegetables from the steam table First of all workers are inattentive they pester you to choose the items abruptly yet forget which items you chose Secondly my meal was literally rice 10 tiny pieces of chicken the size of thumbnail 4 pieces of overcooked broccoli 1 carrot and small pieces of cabbage Thirdly the oil used to fry the chicken had probably not been changed for 3 years as the chicken left a bitter aftertaste on my tongue From the price point of 725 after tax the meal left me unsatisfied and was highly overpriced for the quality and quantity I suggest you to try your luck at other chinese restaurants in the plaza"

    "review":"St Louis Bar and Grill is the neighbourhood place for Chicken Wings and BeerI was there with a buddy of mine and we had the Wing Platter and a pint of Grasshopper an excellent wheat beer from Alberta it was on draft and both were excellentService was fast and friendly and the free WiFi was definitely a plus  The establishment is close to RIM Park and on this visit there were lots of folks there for a hockey tournament  Even though it was busy the staff  were able to deliver great serviceWe came in for a quick meal before the Kitchener Rangers game  It was a fairly busy crowd for a Sunday afternoon  At the time we arrived there was 1 bartender and 1 waitress for the entire restaurant  They were clearly busy  Staff were friendly and trying their best to be attentive which I appreciated  The waitress was quite busy so the bartender came over to take our order  We had Buffalo Chicken Wraps  Given how busy the restaurant was I was pleased with how fast we received our order  The only description I can use to describe our dinner was bland  Wraps really had no taste  Not a memorable dinner but they do get marks for trying really hard to take care of everyone  I am sure the kitchen was in the same boat  Management should probably staff better  I have been here before and has always been a decent experience  For that reason I give 3 starsTerrible service and the food was cold when it got to the table Severely disappointing Not nearly the same experience as it was a few years ago Lots of other good places nearbyA very nice barrestaurant located north of Waterloo ON The atmosphere is pleasant but it may be a little bit noisy when important games are on TV I am very fussy on the taste of food and I know a good tasting sandwich when I eat one We had the Korean bbq sandwich which was very tasty and made with high quality meat The wings come with fries and are also delicious Their fries are absolutely spot on served hot and freshI really wanted to like this place since it is within walking distance from my house The beer selection is good but the food has never been more than 25 Service is standard  The wings though which should be excellent at a place like this need a lot of work in both chicken selection and sauce selection  I actually havent been back since last spring when they decided to play the NBA playoffs instead of the NHL playoffs I called ahead for a group of friends and was told hockey would be on all the televisions but once we were all there the manager told us they changed their minds  I was not impressedNot a big fan of the franchise but I didnt really have a choice since I was going with a group  I was however excited to see a nice patio as well as some new items from their menu  St Louis Chicken Poutine  Not sure if I was incredibly hungry will get to that later or if this was just really good  It may have actually been a combination of both  The serving was actually quite generous especially for its price which was pretty reasonable  One of the reasons I had actually picked this item from the menu IF I were to ever come back to St Louis Bar  Grill choice or not Id order this again  Now comes the service review  It couldve been way better  Everytime we experience slow or poor service Id like to give the staff the benefit of a doubt and would usually first assume that theyre short staffed  Now this is a big weekend in Waterloo  its the weekend the city is hosting the 2016 Volleyball Canada championship This is probably the biggest franchise name near the venue so they should have been more than prepared for big parties  The waitress we had didnt catch her name already seemed to have been in an irritable mood and its not like our party had many requests  She just made it seem like she was being inconvenienced every time  Her demeanour towards my friend who had a request to substitute a burger ingredient was also quite negative  She basically didnt care to even try or try to even understand what the request was  If she were a good waitress or at least showed that she cared to do her job she couldve at least say Ill check with the cooks rather than trying to find excuses to just say no  In the end my friend told her to forget the request and ordered the simplest burger  Then came the wait time  We had waited for the food for about an hour and not once did she come by to apologize for the wait and explain the reason for the delay  If you cant give the reason for the massive delay at least apologize to your customers  Also try to come more than just once or twice to offer drinks ESPECIALLY when the food is taking forever  Finally the food came and we were good  Little did we know a member of our party had spoken with the manager and explained the situation  She came back saying the bill was covered and that she had only paid for the alcoholic beverages purchased  Even though there was this misunderstanding and not to mention awkwardness part of the party was still willing to drop an extra tip  However the same waitress came back with an even negative service and attitude that she ended up losing the very little tip she was about to receive  This was due to the fact that she told my friend who had asked for a takeout box that you cant take away food that wasnt paid for  I first thought that it was because she had thought my friend had ordered the AYCE wing deal which would make sense but it was because the meals were not to be paid for for the poor service Her delivery just created more drama and personally I didnt see the point in telling the member of the party she couldnt take the food  I mean what are they gonna do Reserve the leftovers It just seemed a little too spiteful  If anything the Manager on duty shouldve addressed that concern to the party rather than the waitress  Was just a really disappointing experience which is too bad considering the tournament isnt over and that they basically lost a lot of potential business because of that"

    "review":"Service: AttentiveAtmosphere: homey and quaintFood: tastefulWould return YesPlease be mindful if you plan to go here at night its not well lit or marked and easy to miss Its best to have it in a GPS so you dont miss itAfter a quick search for what was nearby my girlfriend and I decided on the Timeless Cafe They were having their date night special after all We drove into what seemed to be a country estate and were welcomed into a very cozy farm house We were brought to a lightly tabled dinning room and were pleasantly surprised to hear live music which was nice and light The room was decorated by many pieces of art which are for sale if anyone wished to purchase one and the wooden beams and brick walls really gave it a good country feelWe were seated at a small table and drink orders taken quickly We were recommended the Pinot Grigio which was dry and tasteful Some fresh bread was brought out that was accompanied peach and cheese and rosemary and lemon butters They were interesting combinations which was a nice surpriseOur salads were brought out which were a mixed green with pecans goat cheese and a light fig balsamic vinaigrette Everything blended nicely together and paired with the bread it was a nice opening to the mealUp next came the flatbread which was topped with barbecue chicken red onion beans corn cheddar cheese and a marinara sauce It was ok All flavours flowed together nicely except I thought the corn tasted as if it was from frozen bag Now keep in mind its not really corn season but with a menu that changes weekly why choose to have such cheap tasting ingredients I could be completely wrong but to me frozen corn has a very distinct tasteOne of the featured menu items for the week was pork tenderloin which we both ended up ordering It was stuffed with pears and herbs with a blueberry wine reduction served on maple sweet mashed potatoes with cauliflower and brussels sprouts as sides It was full of flavour with every bite but the most surprising thing was that the sprouts were pan fried The potatoes were nice and creamy with just the slightest hint of maple as promised The pinot paired nicely with the tenderloin which mixed pleasantly with the stuffing For dessert we were able to split a chocolate truffle cake with cranberry sauce topped with orange spiced whipped cream and garnished with toast coconut and salted almonds When it was brought out it looked like a souffle which was different from what I was expecting but still good The cake was rich and light and when paired with the cranberry sauce it carried a good tangAll in all it was a pleasant dinning experience but there wasnt anything that had any wow factor for me The staff there was really good the decor was great and the food was a little more than ok Ill definitely be checking their website to see what their menus have that week just to see if something sounds interestingwe just had dinner there tonight and it was excellent the meal service and ambience was perfect i highly recommend Timeless Cafe  perfect for foodies :A great place to dine in Waterloo Very beautiful and cozy The food is delicious and comes in excellent presentation I had lunch there There are not so many options on the menu but they all taste like homemade food Ill definitely go back again On Saturdays go earlier for brunch because I went there after 12 and they only offered lunchWonderful Worth the time to hunt down this small place on the edge of the country Fresh ingredients and all local made  We had an early lunch but it looked like a great place to just drop in for a coffee and pastry It clearly has a loyal clientele that has grown by work of mouth and who that appreciate it enough to make the drive"

    "review":"Food was good  Service was not  After being seated we had a waitress who didnt introduce herself ask us for our order  We order steamed muscles to start  The appetizer was huge and VERY good once she cleared off our plates I order a second pint  She brought us our complimentry salads at this point I had to ask for my Pint again took 10mins we were sitting right accross from the bar  The salads would have been nicer served on a cold plate I think they were premade and sitting  The entres came very hot and so good I had the Chicken parm and my wife had the Trout  Her risotto tasted very over cooked  Other than having to ask our server a few times to get things the over all experience was good and the food was very tasty  We will go back  4 pints1 app2 mains97 tipThe food was excellent no complaints I had the Mafalda Rustica and my companion had the Cappelletti and both were fresh tasting and delicious The service was slow really slow about an hour to get our entrees To their credit they did keep bringing us bread I had an Italian lager of some sort it wasnt memorable at all As the other review mentioned the water here tastes a bit off We were too full for dessert but there looked to be some tasty optionsThe lighting was terribly dim in there to the point of being difficult to see I understand its supposed to add ambience but it was a bit muchWow my wife and I were craving pasta while we were in town I find that food in Kitchener typically quite horrible  We sat at a table with a bunch of photos on the wall old Italian family photos  I thought wow nice photos they cut out of Vanity FairA nice older Italian woman that was smitten with my daughter was very prompt and courteous the portions were perfect  Not the massive American style portionsThe vodka sauce was as good as Il Mulinos in NYC and my wifes pasta screamed Rome to us  It was quite an incredible lunch experience  Everything tasted homemade at the end of the meal we took home a container of bolognese  Good thing it wasnt in an airtight container otherwise I wouldve bought a ton more to bring home to CaliforniaAnyhow back to the woman serving us and the photos turns out she owned the joint and her photo was one that I was admiring earlier on  Love itAmazing taste of little Italy in the big city This is a quaint little spot is right in the middle of everything so make the effort to stop in and enjoy a fabulous meal with a real home cooked Italian tasteI would highly recommend the Passover bread as it a personal favourite and must have for my wife and I Decent wine selection that could be a little better but the reason we come here is for the excellent food and delightful service 5 stars A nice Italian family run restaurant Classic Italian dishes served in a comfortable environment Excellent for dining in or take out They even sell jars of their home made meat sauce Overall an excellent establishment I work in the area so i have been here quite a number if times I always enjoy it I have seen Ennio there occaisionally but usually its his wife  daughter that are thereThis place was great I like that the pasta entrees come with a small side salad and fresh bread The oil they give to dip the bread in is deliciousI ordered the mushroom and bacon carbonara My only complaint was that it was extremely salty  I ended up not eating most of the bacon just because it was so salty  Other than that it was really good"

    "review":"TLDR: Very tasty food smoothies and especially the desserts Quiet pleasant dining in Belmont villageMy wife and I walked in off the street thinking wed try a little something We ended up having a whole meal The place seats maybe 20ish people and is laid out nicely so you wouldnt feel crowded There were several small tables outside The ambiance is bright and comfortable with simple classy furniture and settingsIt says right on the menu that everything is gluten and dairy free We split a delicious vanilla chai spice smoothie I ordered the nori rolls and my wife got the dontbechicken salad sandwich I was a little disappointed with my nori rolls until I realized that I was still expecting them to taste like sushi with some nice fluffy rice Once I tucked away that expectation I enjoyed the medley of vegetables and marinated mushrooms in the nori roll My wifes faux chicken salad sandwich was really tasty It didnt actually taste like chicken salad but it still had a unique delicious creamy flavorWe topped it all off with a piece of key lime pie which comes in a coollooking cube topped with dairyfree whipped cream and a chocolatecovered macaroon The first bites of both desserts were so good they made my eyes roll back in my head We completely cleaned our plates I highly recommend giving this place a try As we were leaving our server was telling us that her favorite dessert was the banana cream pie I will definitely be going back to try thatPretty good left satisfied after indulging in the pad thai Big portion and the watermelon drink that day hit the spot Cant wait to leave enough room for dessert next timeClean and spacious place Great service We went on a Saturday night and it was just us and another couple eating in We tried the pizza the bean tacos and the nori rolls The food was very tasty however expensive for the amount we received for the bean tacos and pizza Not somewhere you want to go if you are looking for large portions and paying a reasonable price I would go here again but I would not select the main dishes again as it was really not worth the price you payThis quaint little eatery is located in the heart of Belmont VillageThe food is all raw vegan Normally this would be the last place youd ever find me being a huge fan of anything with meat in it However when I was dragged here by a more adventurous friend I was pleasantly surprisedI ordered the pad thai Normally I would not be able to eat pad thai due to my peanut allergy however here they use cashews instead so I was able to venture a taste It was THE best fauxnoodle bowl Ive ever eaten I wouldnt say the flavours were true pad thai but it was still saltysweet and very delicious nonethelessMy friend ordered the fauxmeat taco wraps She also said she enjoyed them We also sampled a couple of their desserts such as the cheeseless cheesecake it was almond based  like a soft marzipan which were out of this worldAnother visit I ordered the spring rolls in rice paper with a thai sauce  they were absolutely deliciousIn addition they have some food staples you can buy such as glutenfree vegan tortillas And they also have their cookbook for sale with a lot of their recipesThe only downside apart from the lack of meat of course is the prices  the dishes are quite expensive for what they are The spring rolls for example cost 6  for some garden veggies wrapped in rice paper The pad thai I think was 15 for some zucchini noodles sauce and a handful of sprouts and cashews"

    "review":"I came with my wife and found about 5 other people backed up at the door despite plenty of empty tables The wait staff wandered dazedly about the restaurant for 1015 minutes before one waitress began seating people By this time 2 additional groups had joined us and our cramped line had spilled out of the front door It was about 1015 more minutes waiting to see a waitress My wife ordered the Sunset Sandwich with regular bacon and I ordered the Sunset Super with peameal We waited an extra half an hour before we got our meals and my wifes sandwich had no cheese When we finally flagged a waiter not our own as we couldnt get a hold of her he returned it with cold shredded cheese sprinkled on top My wife had to send it back a second time in order to get it made properlyWe grabbed a third waitress in order to get our check since we still couldnt get our own A fourth waitress who happened to be at the counter checked us out and opted to take 50 off of my wifes sandwich and remove her drink from the bill instead of making us wait longer to get the manager to come over  but only after some substantial explanation of our experience and a bunch of bargainingThe food itself was okay My eggs were fine and the peameal bacon was pretty good The pancakes were decent but the hash browns were mediocre  flavourless and not particularly crispy My wife said her sandwich was fine but had the same thoughts about the hash browns The food by no means accounted for the terrible experience caused by an admittedly amiable yet absolutely incompetent wait staffI dont think its been any less than a year since I last left a restaurant without leaving a tipAmazing service  Amazing food  Clean environment one of the only places I have ever actually been able to finish my breakfast  Thanks guysWhen I try places  I like to go more than once regardless of my first experience to really try out a location  Ive came for breakfast with family and friends  Let me tell you the four times Ive come here proved for me not to return  If you like moldy dry sour tasting pancakes this is the place to get them  If you want chocolate chips in them they will burn and taste sour which is odd  The omlete has come out wet when I ordered and the wait for it was loong  You are better off making breakfast at home  There was no service even when it wasnt busy  No one greets you upon arrival  You seat yourself and when you want to pay you get up to the door and pay there  Ive also had pancakes and a side of eggs for take out  Not worth it for the price  I really had high hopes for this place considering that it is a franchise and close to my homeWell every time a new breakfast place opens up in the area we try and get in to give it a try and being that I have been to the Sunset Grill in Oshawa I thought this would be a no brainer  WRONG Ill start on a high note the sausage is AMAZING Might be the best Ive ever had and the portions are large which is good for a hungry diner I suppose however the place is a disorganized mess I was there on a Saturday around noon so I understand that is a very busy time in our area for a breakfast place but holy we were basically sitting in the laps of the couple next to us I was slightly irritated right from the get go because we were the first ones in a long line to be seated and yet somehow the last ones to be servedAs we watched the people who arrived after us enjoying their breakfast I was starting to get impatient and kept looking at the opening to the kitchen and sure enough I see some eggs headed straight for us that were Sunnyside up not what we ordered so we sent them back right away After waiting another 15 minutes new plates arrived now containing sausage for my boyfriend who did not order sausage The manager asked if it was alright and being that we were hungry we took the plate anyways He made some sort of gesture regarding the meal but we couldnt really hear him over the diners around us so we just kinda did the old smile and nod and went on with our meal When we received our bill I was really surprised to find we had been charged for the sausage that he did not order and did not eat he simply moved them from his plate because he doesnt like sausage I hate to be stingy but since we were paying for them anyways we at least took them home for our dogs to enjoy but I was still bothered that they would charge us for food we didnt order especially after they brought us the wrong meals the first time aroundOne other thing I was bothered by was we watched 2 different waitresses drop things on the floor and serve them to guests anyways one was a spoon and the other was sugar and jam packagesIm sorry but a spoon off the floor That is just gross"

    "review":"I like their pizza but the delivery is very hit and miss Took an hour to delivery a pizza order at 5pm Suggest the specialty pizzasToppers Pizza on Highland Road is a great little Pizza shop the staff is always so friendly and helpful I would recommend them to anyone and you have to try one of their panzerottis they are SO good I always have strange requests about having them cooked a certain way and they are always happy to help Plus they have a loyalty program buy 10 pizzas get 1 free so thats a bonusFood was crapy service was even worseI dont know what to say Im so disappointed with this location its not even funny I have been eating here regularly for about 4 years and last night we ordered our usual order which is two panzerottis and and order of garlic bread sticks When we got home we looked at our bread sticks and they were all dough It was not even remotely cooked but since theyve always been so good to us we thought nothing of it and tossed them in our oven on broil while we got our panzerottis ready As we cut into them we both noticed that neither one had any tomato sauce inside so we called and very politely requested that they make us a new order and we would bring ours back When I suggested this they said we could bring it back and they would make us new bread sticks and add some sauce to our panzerottis To me this is unacceptable as our whole order was screwed up I felt I deserved a new order especially since this order cost us over 2000 and all the toppings of the panzerotti were just falling out without sauce inside to help hold it together When I insisted that I would like a new order made and I would bring this back he asked to put me on hold while he served a customer in the store Again I felt this kind of customer service was unacceptable as I knew there were at least two people working since I had seen them 2 minutes earlier When he finally returned to the phone he insisted that it was not made incorrectly and that they never have tomato sauce but he could still add it for us anyways At that point I was extremely offended as I have ordered the exact same meal there for about 4 years as if I would be mistaken about how its prepared I said never mind I will come right back and get my money back and that is exactly what I did I wish I knew what happened at this place it used to be my absolute favourite pizza place The staff used to be so friendly and welcoming and now they seem to look miserable and unhappy The quality of the food has steadily been declining over the past six months as well as the condition of the inside of the location and I guess this was my breaking point We try to be environmentally friendly at home and I always look for the same quality in businesses we choose to support and I waited in there for about 1015 minutes for my original order and the whole time i was in there they had water running full blast in an empty sink This also really bothered me however I do understand there COULD be a reasonable explanation for this kind of wasteful behaviour so I looked the other way Also more recently we have noticed everything attached to their walls has been collecting dust and dead bugs for what looks like forever All it needs is a simple wipe down it would take 510 minutes max I am so disappointed as the next closest Toppers is in Cambridge I really hope they get their act together in the next few months I plan to give them another try in a few months because like I said when its made properly it really is the best pizza around I will post a new review for sure when I do no matter what the outcome  In the meantime however I guess I will have to find a new pizza place :"

    "review":"There seems to be a severe lack of quality Chinese food restaurants in KW for some reason This place is the best one Ive found next to the Mandarin It is not super amazing or anything but it is better than most places in KWMy family has been eating here for years  We have tried other chinese places but none were as good as here  The quality and freshness of the food is amazing  The service was great and they were pretty flexible with their foods  We had the Cantonese Chow Mein their special fried rice chicken wings spring rolls wonton soups and another vegetable dish to our specifications  We requested no pork and they were fine with that  Other chinese places down the road denied that even though it was an allergy  The cook was very happy and helpful and provided excellent service  Overall for the price which unlike other places only goes up every like 4 or so years instead of 1 year is very reasonable for the quality and service  Great food and service  I highly recommend to anyone who has been meaning to try  The front people are very helpfulIve been going here for years now and the quality and service never change from fantastic The food is really great for chinese  compared to lots of other places in the area and the prices are very affordable Dine in or take out if youre feeling like Chinese food try this place outPretty disappointing There were only bean sprouts in the Vegetable Chop Suey and there was hardly any sauce on the Cantonese Chow MeinThe only positives were that the fried rice was OK and at least the price wasnt too highIll be trying another place next timeNothing offensive about the place so I am giving 2 stars instead of 1One of the first Chinese fast food places I tried after moving from California The food was terrible  I ordered beef and broccoli  and my husband ordered kung pao chicken I am not sure if you could even call the dishes Chinese My beef and broccoli had a lot of very thin light colored gravy on it which is not typical and my husbands Kungpao chicken was quite sour and had strange julianne cut veggies in it which is not typical either EDIT 51416  Just to clarify they didnt have this dish on the menu so I asked if they could make Kungpao chicken I explained that it had brown spicy sauce and had peanuts in it and the server gave us this particular dish so it could have been a totally different dish all together EDIT end   Big disappointment The service was great though  I felt bad for the girl who worked there Her service was 10 times better than the food we tasted Maybe they do other things better but we are not going back"

    "review":"Good food good service Theres really not much of a choice in St Jacobs We had steamed mussels resting in a juicy tomato sauce for our appetizer And the main courses:1 a rack of lamb in a curry cause with basmati rice and veggies2 fish and chipsAs an outoftown visitor who travels to St Jacobs every few months I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jacobs Grill stays open for the dinner crowd on weekdays ie 10pm late Thats hard to come by in St Jacobs with the lone exception of BenjaminsIve been to Jacobs Grill many times now and have never had a bad experience Its a great place with a nice modernyetinviting atmosphere to grab an afterwork drink or dinner And lunch on the patio is wonderful too One of my favorite parts of dining here though is the wait staff  theyve always been incredibly friendly and accommodating The food is aboveaverage I have enjoyed everything Ive tried here Some highlights are the cedarplank brie the Thai Noodles and the Jacobs Mac and Cheese The Black and Blue burger was also delicious if youre looking for a red meat fix And the crispy potato wedges are seriously some of the best Ive ever had and Im kind of a snob about good fries of any kindId highly recommend dining here if youre looking for a relaxed but great dinner or in the St Jacobs areaDecided to try it out after reading all the great reviews here  It did not disappoint the reviews here were most accurate  The portions were huge the food was great the service was good  All in all it was a good experience and would go backYou would think that a small touristy town like Saint Jacobs Where you have an abundance of local farmers especially with the BIG menonite farmers market nearby and local aquaculture You would get the best food southwestern ontario has to offer but NO Ordered the proper fish and chips or should I call them IMPROPER fish and chips Fish was drenched in oil over cooked probably used the same fryer for the fries as well It was disappointing to say the least considering its almost 1500 bucks for the dish alone I should have just stayed at the farmers market and got some hotdogs apple fritters  pop less than that amountI have been a couple of times now I like the village of St Jacobs and this restaurant is nice but not spectacular I find the service a bit inconsistent as well as the food The last time I was in I ordered the fish  chips Aside from that I found it unmemorable I certainly have no need to try the fish and chips againOn my most recent visit I ordered the croque monsieur For anyone that has had a CM they know that this is a special cheese sandwich and unique in the world of sandwiches They also know that the outside of the cheese sandwich contains fried cheese and that it crunches The menu here describes the CM as containing ham this is normal and some dijon mustardmayo combination that the menu brags about this is sort of unusual No mention of emmenthal or gruyere cheese No mention of bechamel sauce These should have been my clues that things were off But greed overrode reason and here I amWhen I received the offering I noted immediately that this was not a croque monsieur In fact it is so far removed from a CM that the French should rise up and sue this place My CM was white bread toasted in a waffle panini press with some unknown cheese a few slices of ham and the dijonmayo spread There was no cheese on the outside and the sandwich itself was very small This came with a side of potato wedges which are not worth commenting onAs I was out with friends I did not bring this to the waitresses attention for several reasons namely if the chef doesnt know what the hell a CM is I did not wish to further delude myself into believing someone at Jacobs Grill knew what a CM wasIn short if you have 1199 and are looking for a nice sandwich I would suggest going to Vincenzos in Waterloo on Wednesdays and having one of their home run grill cheese sandwiches for 4 You can spend the remaining 8 on a nice piece of cheese from FranceJacobs Grill you should be ashamedWe visit St Jacobs for outlet shopping and the Farmers market and shops once or twice a year The first time we went to Jacobs Grill will be the last Previously we ate at the adjacent Stone Crock bakery with great food My son hated his 725 kids thin rubbery pizza although the added cookie from the bakery was ok My wife had a Caesar salad that she could only choke down 12 off She said it didnt taste like a Caesar and was much too sweet I had a Tandoori chicken wrap that was tasteless and cold for 1299 My side salad was barely acceptable Service was slow and impersonal Someone needs to train these people It seemed busy with nice weather in March They must have some good foodwe just didnt find it"

    "review":"This is a good restaurant chain The food is consistently good if not great across the menu They have different pizzas available Definitely not the best pizza you can get the crust is not thin or crackerlike enough but the toppings and flavour combinations are good Sandwiches and appetizers are also generally good They treat kids very well and keep them entertained with nice giveaways It is definitely a chain experience but a good one for the genreAlways amazing service stellar food great environment and its not pricy for all you get Hands down my fav place to goStandard Boston Pizza You will got what you are looking forThe movie finished late and most of our usual places were closed so we tried this one  Tuesday is pasta special day so I ordered the seafood linguine with Alfredo sauce which I usually LOVE My daughter ordered linguine with a rose sauce and a few meatballs We also had the Caesars to start and one order of cheesy garlic bread The salad was delish and huge 245 with Renees dressing  The cheesy garlic bread wasnt very garlicky at all and was soso  My pasta had cubes of overcooked salmon in it not very pleasant 4 tiny shrimp and a few itty bitty scallops and even when covered in their grated parmesan cheese had almost no taste whatsoever  I think they forgot to add cheese to the sauce  My daughters pasta sauce wasnt much better what there was of it  Talk about skimpy Enough just to barely coat the pasta and lacking any flavour  The meatballs are light and huge and slightly peppery  Theyre ok and might have been better with some sauce but there wasnt any to spare on the plate  The pasta was quite dry  All in all an edible meal but lacking flavour  Most of it ended up in take out containers  We plan on adding cheese and sauces when we reheat it  Too expensive to just throw away  Even on the Tuesday special no drinks just water our meal was close to 40  When I saw the menu I was quite excited and said well have to come back a few times to try some other things  NO  Not after wasting money on these two dishes  I wish we had just gone home and opened a bottle of Classico Alfredo from the supermarket and boiled some fresh pasta  Also the pasta was a bit more then al dente  It was hard  I guess their pizza must be better but well never know now  Wish I had tried something else insteadI cant believe how crowded this place always seems to be Its a sportsbarpizza place A little overpriced in my opinion for what you get The food is mediocre and while not the worst Ive had definitely not anything worth repeating Tried it twice but probably wont go backalways a gathering place for teams on friday nights after a great game of soccer like the atmosphere and the service but not the quality of food dont get the pizzas as you can have much better ones almost anywhere else i know its funny for a pizza place unless you make your own in which case you get to spend a lot careful with the specials as they are mostly at the bar and they dont warn you of that when you order i had a few odd moments trying to show the help fliers all around the dining room with the days specials only to have them refuse my claims every time best food here undoubtedly the nachos fullyloaded and the phillycheesesteak sandwich"

    "review":"Amazing I took my boyfriend here for his birthday back in January and even though the seasonal vegetable selection wasnt the greatest as expected it was great We both had steak and it was done perfectly Delicious and juicy The service was great Someone greeted us immediately and politely Seated us and answered any questions we had about the menu It also has this artsy antique atmosphere with a slight mysterious vibe happening It was different in a cool way The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because of the vegetable selection during the winter and because the menu was very small I understand good quality restaurants are but I just feel they should have maybe 2 diff size options for steak and maybe 2 options for chicken Wel will be back in the fall :Great restaurant  was surprised to find it so busy on a Tuesday night I came around 7:30 and the dining room was full  The service was really good The french onion soup was one of the best Ive had Did not taste like traditional french onion soup but had a great flavour and was not excessively salty like some soups are  Also had the arugula  quinoa salad with striploin  The salad was really great  with a light dressing and lots of toppingsThis is a good choice if you want a change from your traditional chain restaurants Mostly Local and fresh ingredients The food and service were both very good Our server knew his stuff and seemed to really enjoy his jobLast two times we have visited service has been slow First time was just for drinks Second time was for lunch their buttermilk chicken is amazing Where the service was lacking the food made up for itATTENTION: Wine by the ounceNow on with our regularly scheduled programmingI really loved this spot for a quiet on a Sunday evening that is dinner for two with my fiance We enjoyed the grilled taco entree he had the fish and I had the tofu with a glass of local niagara red wine on tap for 1 an ounce Love that I can get 5 ounces or 4 or 3 or whatever I wish without having to commit to the typical 9 ounce serving at most places The tacos tasted very fresh and went well with the signature sweet chili sauce which we requested on the side The adjacent 1889 schoolhouse is a lovely touch within a lessthan scenic strip mall location We will definitely be back next time were in KitchenerFrequent guest at Borealis for both business and with immediate and extended family Always well presented and tasty food Goodsized portions but not gigantic everything always fresh and after at least 1012 visits Ive yet to have anything not meet our standards The specials are usually interesting and wellprepared choices and the tastiness of the meals is always a good notch above ordinary  really nice The dessert menu is the only minor letdown for me lack of much chocolate but they have a good selection and last weekends fruit gelato was excellent Staff hosts bar servers is wonderful and service is quick but not rushed though Ive had one or two visits where it was unusually busyhectic All three eating areas plus private room under bar are comfortably decorated though if crowded the upstairs can be a tiny bit loud Several servers have made our day there including the genuinely amazing Luigi though the new policy of not allowing servers to have cell phones with them have prevented us from seeing pictures of his beautiful new baby girl shame on management :Recommended place to eat for really tasty and local food excellent atmosphere and prices and great staff Great for family dates business Four solid stars"

    "review":"Aw yea best Ethiopian food in town They have 3 meat dishes and rest are vegan friendly including the bread with glutenfree option Lamb is really goodThe perfect example of dont judge a book by its cover My SO and I decided to give this place a go because of its great reviews We were the only customers at the time because we had lunch at 4pm Otherwise the owner I presume just had some regulars or friends sitting at the bar talking to him They were really kind people tooAs we sat there I admit we had our doubts The restaurant itself has seen better days It was in the heart of Kitchener and people stared at us through the window then at the restaurant sign We didnt know what to expect and I feel a bit guilty because now I do genuinely like this placeHe could tell instantly it was our first time trying anything of this sort and tried to walk us through it a little We were definitely surprised at the size our platter was We ordered the beef and lamb tibs which was delicious It came with so much injera  the absorbent sourdough flat bread No cutlery you just pick the meat up with the bread The meat was so good You could tell they were lean cuts of meat but they werent tough It was cooked well and the sauce kept it from going dry Now we dont like the taste of sourdough bread so that was just our own fault for not doing research But by what we saw everything was really authentic and wellmade It came with a simple side salad of shredded romaine I dont know what was in that oilbased dressing but it was really good and I ate all of itSince it was just him working it was sometimes hard tracking him down because he would be cleaning something behind the bar or in the back But when he had his back turned a friend would always see us and tell him we needed something I thought that was really nice of themWe ended up having to take the rest home The owner helped us pack it up and the box was so heavy He told us he really appreciated us comingIf you want something different out of the ordinary this might be something to check out Watch out some of the portions seem smaller than what they really are I remember starting a meal thinking I probably have to order more later but half way through the dish I was absolutely fullWe went to this restaurant when we went to see Oktoberfest in Kitchener Ontario We found the food too good It was the first time eating EritreanEthiopian food Its billboard emphasising as special for vegetarian dishes attracted us as we are vegetarians and everything exceeded our expectations It looked as if it is run by a family who have come from that region and started this restaurant more than 10 years ago The manager Afework Girmayie as stated on his business card seemed to be the owner as well who was kind enough explaining to us the mystery of east African food and making us comfortable He was polite and humble The food was reasonably priced He displayed a picture of the scientist Stephen Hawking who had visited his restaurant We highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be going there again on our next visit In fact this restaurant created a desire in us to eat EritreanEhtopian food whenever possibleFood is OK Ordered Lamb TiBSAlicha It came with two Enjira breads and a salad on the side It was tasty but not mindblowingly amazing I have had better in other restaurants One major complaint is that they take waaaaaaaaaaay too much time to make the food After ordering 8 of us they took almost two hours to serve the food If you are in hurry or you get angry when you get hungry like me this is not for youThe food that they do make here is really good and there are interesting vegetarian choices The menu however is pretty limited  and doesnt include any Ethiopian curries so dont expect anything extravagant The owner is super nice and friendly but the atmosphere is a bit dingey I usually get takeout and eat the food at home  and it lasts two meals"

    "review":"I remember growing up when this place was called the Phoenix and was a roller blading rink  Though its a nightclub now it also has a restaurant which serves pretty decent food  I was with a group with one guy who comes by frequently for dinner  Given that it is normally a nightclub it was unexpectedly good  The meal came to 22 including tip for myself  I had the pad thai with the serving size of about almost 2 baseballs which was pretty good  I liked the level of spice but from experience I know that a lot of people might find it a bit too spicy  It was decent and I liked their take on it  with just chicken and tofu The entrees in general range from 1530 and others ordered and were pretty pleased with tempura halibut with an accompanying sweet and sour sauce and pizzas that appeared reasonably large   The ambiance was pretty good with the music getting louder though not too loud as the night went on  The nice thing about this location is that the parking lot is massive if youre coming for dinner and you dont have to worry about parking  Id definitely feel comfortable in recommending itI have to say the food at the Flying dog was incredible however the atmosphere was a little offbut I am considering the fact that this place is considered a night club and we arrived for dinner at 7:00pm so I suppose that was a little early We were not overly thrilled with the seating as we had called in advance to reserve a booth and it was a velvet wrapped cushion that seemed to have pillow soft filling so your bottom simply sinks right down the the wood I can honestly say it was the most uncomfortable Ive ever been in a restaurant but when the food came out it was Amazing I forgot about the painful seating entirely They had a special meal offered when we were there for Perogies and they were quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten We also had French Onion Soup to start which was delicious and someone at the table had a Tempura Halibut which was also amazing The server was extremely nice and efficient All in All I would recommend The Flying Dog and I will definitely go back againI put off going to the flying dog thinking it was going to be way to much money  Turns out its pretty much the same as other places at eat at  Food was surprisingly good  Had a nice wine list as well  The booths are awful  I kinda felt like my boobs were in my food because they squished down so much  My other friends felt the same Ill be going back  If you like sweet potatoe fries  You need to try them here and with the garlic aloi dip they come with  Bonus there like 4 dollars and you get more then most places Came here for my sisterinlaws 40th Birthday dinner The food was great and the service was wonderful There was a minor mix up with my daughters order and the waitress was great about making it right Its really too bad that not very many people seem to know that The Flying Dog isnt just a nightclub During dinner hours its a really great restaurantWent there for a date night Food was ok Service was Ok Nothing really special Environment was great though Waited 40 mins for souffl Wasnt that good Not as good as we had at Joey Maybe will come back for another try Really like the environment thoughEdit: changed this one to a twostar since both me and my girlfriend got stomach ache after we got homeI have been a regular at The Dog for a few years since I moved to the neighbourhood  It is pretty much the closest restaurant to where I live  The other night is the first time I have been there since joining Yelp so I thought I better do a reviewWe went with another couple and sat in a large booth in the front section which was quite comfortable and the atmosphere was nice  I must admit that my visitations are in a bit of a rut  Wednesday is halfprice pasta night  And as usual the four of us had pasta  I have been there on other nights and tried other dishes but I keep coming back for the pasta which I think makes me a cheapskate  but I do tip based on the full price  The place is huge so I never need a reservation for an early arrival 6:00ishThe pastas come in two sizes  appetizer and entree for 9 and 17 respectively There are 5 pastas to choose from I had the pepper steak fusilli and my 3 companions all had the chicken bonconcinni Offerings change occasionally but there is also usually a seafood  a PadThai and anotherThe portions are generous and I have never been disappointed  The drinks are a bit expensive wine 9 a glass beer 8 but factor in the complementary  bread always 4 different styles all wonderful and the halfprice pasta and Wednesday is a very economical evening outDesserts should you have room are somewhat of a disappointment with cheesecake being overrepresented  But for a special occasion they have a chocolate souffle for 2 made to order that is spectacular  Ordering it requires 30 minutes so plan well in advance"

    "review":"A few underwhelming experiences of egg rolls that tasted like mushy wet newspaper mucousy not a word but Im going with it soups and disappointing dishes have made me a little gunshy of the Chinese restaurants in the KW area But China Garden was different Its not much to look at inside but the food is delicious  and consistently delicious No matter what you order off the menu you wont be disappointed Ill confess that Im not too adventurous when it comes to Chinese food but I have tried everything that my way more adventurous partner orders and I love it all China Garden is so good that I trust whatever they make will be tasty If youve been disappointed with other KW area Chinese Canadian takeout give China Garden a tryI ordered their food to be delivered and it took one hour and forty minutes for it to arrive After an hour and thirty minutes I impatiently called them and was greeted quiet rudely with zero apology When it finally arrived once again there was no apology The food was pretty good but that experience left me not wanting to ever return I will definitely be ordering from another Chinese restaurant next timeI bought the roast duck based on previous tips It was quite tasty and well cooked The quantity is very big and decent for one person It comes with rice and some lettuce Hope you order it and like it as much as I do I havent given it the full 5 stars since the ambience is a bit low key They could do it up more and they would get my 5 But great food in any caseFood isnt bad but questionable service We were served food that someone else brought backI like their BBQ duck the flavour is amazing Other stuff we ordered were average and pretty expensive considering the portionGreat food great prices Ordered a few basics: orange beef garlic ginger chicken chefs special pork tenderloin all delicious The springrolls left something to be desired though: they werent flavourful at all We ordered online and had them deliver and they were here 10 minutes before the quoted time Hows that for efficiency The 3 dishes we ordered lasted us two adults 2 days and about 3 meals so the value for money and portion sizes are excellent I have no issues with this place so a solid 5 stars from me"

    "review":"I had a nice time going to Grace and Healthy The dumplings are made with care They came out hot steaming and fresh I ordered the kimchi pork the shrimp the lamb they are all filling and yummy I would recommend the shrimp the most The soy sauce you can make it to your deisre I added sugar vinegar chili and soy sauce to my taste and it was perfect The price was fair the cheapest was about 6 dollars and you can get a decent meal The only one thing is that the restaurant looks old and worn down and it is not the most tidy and clean But all in all it was good food for a fair price I would definitely recommendI came with my sister one night hoping to eat cleaner for a change We ordered a bowl of congee and a plate of dumplings Weve been here often and had no complaints They charged us 20 bucks for these two dishes We were definitely mad that we got ripped off They never gave any receipt so it was inarguable Could have just been a mistake by the waitress but still got us really pissed offThese are some of the best dumplings Ive ever tasted They are simple delicious and you can tell that they use good quality ingredients They have a number of options for the filling and I can honestly say that all of them are quite good For first timers Id go for the Kimchi pork dumplings You can also order congee also a few to choose from as a starter and if you get a combo deal they throw in a soymarinated egg My only complaint is that the price is somewhat high for the amount of food you get in the end The dumplings wont be too filling but at least its not drizzled in oil like most other places in the plazaIve eaten several times at this restaurant and have had the same experience each and every timeThe menu is limited : dumplings congee noodle soup   The dumplings are superb  Handmade delicious very fresh served piping hot and very reasonably price The noodle soup broth is borderline tasteless the congee has great consistency but also lacks any depth of flavour this restaurant does not make a good soup stock it is not a strengthSo the reasons for the poor review:  Service is adequate but only just  You need to ask for a lot of things and wave staff over to make requests  often  The cleanliness of the restaurant started out pretty good but is steadily going downhill the spring months will be a damp disaster given the state of their floors and Id love to see evidence that the condiment containers get a rudimentary cleaning once in a while given the increasing stickiness of the soysauce and hot chili oil jars I doubt itAnd the absolutely most annoying part about the dining experience here:  beverages are served in cheap flimsy disposable cups and refills on any drinks are hard to come by you need to ask and ask again repeatedly  Im in a state of befuddled amazement that a restaurant wont invest in something very very basic  glasses and mugs  teacups  Especially when beverages are typically the largest profit margin on a restaurants menuIm underwhelmed by the restaurant as a whole in my opinion theyre getting rave reviews only because they are currently the only dumpling restaurant in town  If a competitor should arise that offers better service and a more professional experience watch outA little overpriced for the dumplings but very tastyAmazing food love the pork dumplings and the tea they give us I just wish the service was a bit faster but for the quality of the food they serve I cant complain"

    "review":"Not sure what the hype is about The service is delayed Food is really just ok I guess there seem to be a neighborhood bias We got fried chicken and BBQ chicken They both were all bad The spot is quite pricy too I will prefer Lancaster smokehouse any day over this placeBest barbecue joint in the KitchenerWaterloo region Extra marks for their pulled pork one of the best Ive ever hadWhat a great experience And not just because we were starving Honestly Im so glad I listened to the other good reviewers First Im going to tell you: do NOT let the outside turn you off of going in It looks like a little hole in the wall and it is small  but it is so thoughtfully decorated and so warmtrust medont look at the signjust go inside  Sarah and Darryl sorry if I spelled names wrong have a great place going on We were lucky enough to be served by Sarah who was super friendly and obviously very knowledgeable about the food But first the beer Try the Stratus Fear on tap So great As for food we had the fried chicken crispy and juicy and delicious and we got one of the platters so we could sample the smoked meats The wings and ribs were fantastic These arent your dumbeddown version of ribs you get at most places Im looking at YOU Swiss Chalet nopethese ribs and wings are properly smoked Gorgeous crust and truly smoky amazingness The pulled pork was crazy good with a sticky sweet crust that I want to roll around in The jalapeo mac and cheese was solid but I think my favourite thing was the jalapeo hush puppies Do not question just order them Trust me on this Youre welcome I have been to Louisiana  I never had food this good when I was there All that was missing was a hurricane and they might have had them on the menu but the draught was so good I didnt think to ask  Were an hour from Waterloo I will happily drive an hour to have dinner at this place againWent here with a friend wanting to try their chicken  waffles dish during dinner time but they sold out due to it being Mothers Day brunch day : They first give you a cup of popcorn with some sweet BBQ powder topping  SO GOOD We ended up sharing the 3 meat platter: rackoribs waitress said it was 3 ribs but got 4 pieces texas style beef brisket 4 slices and buttermilk fried chicken 1 medium sized piece It comes with cornbread  2 sides so we chose: fries and the jalapeo maccheese My fav was the buttermilk chicken  it was crispy and tender not dry at all This place was surprisingly small fits only about 15 people Overall good food and definitely still want to come back to try their chicken and wafflesPretty good food Great staff very friendly and know the menu well Everything was good  it just sucked that the one time I went they were out of brisket which was the main thing I was interested in The pulled pork I got though was very good and I enjoyed the many sides offered hushpuppies cornbread etc not just your  typical french fries or onion rings As my second meat I ordered the fried chicken Now they did come fresh out of the fryer and are pretty hot and greasy Id recommend if you get the fried chicken to let it rest in your plate for 10 minutes or so to cool off then dig in I think youll be in for a treatId be giving this joint 4 stars if it wasnt for the fact they didnt have any brisket when I visited as well i paid 20 dollars for not a whole lot of food 2 pieces of chicken handful of pulled pork a bowl of mac and cheese handful of hush puppies and cornbread  i think they should increase portion size a bit Although I may have just had bad luckBesides those 2 issues Im very satisfied with the location Most of all the people were great welcoming and not too pushy or annoying An excellent place to get a few friends out to have some drinks and enjoy some delicious barbecue Worth a try for sureThought the big BBQ combo was great for a group of 4 Boxed up lots of leftovers to go home too"

    "review":"ate here the other night and developed some mixed feelings it took the waitress 40 minutes yes timed to the minute to bring us our beers after ordering she forgot to place our food order so that took even longer eventually the manager intervened and gave us a new waitress who was great the food was decent i had a burger but nothing to rave about as far as food is concerned i expected more from a brew pubthe beer however was great worth checking this place out especially on a nice day ill give this place another shoti wont let one waitress spoil it for me :Ive been to the Barley Works many times for different occasions: from companiessponsored social events to just hangouts with friends I like their cozy atmosphere and the craft beer Food is average not the best but good enough and their patio is huge and wonderful during warm daysIts more quiet than other pubs in Waterloo and its more mature than other locations which tends to be filled up with undergraduate studentsLocated inside Huether Hotel Get beer from the Lion Brewery inside the same place and enjoy on the patio Great place when the weather is nice outsideI love the Huether especially for a night at the Princess The cavern look is a great atmosphere the food is good hearty and lots of it and mostly the beer is spot on The menu seems to updated from time to time and I recently had the mac n cheese with chicken  Excellent and way too much to eat in one sittingThe good  decent selection of average beers                   great patio good locationThe bad  By far the worst service as far as response time going back in memory quite a while  Make sure you order and have time  our food was 35 min to the table but had to put our order in with another waitress as we couldnt find oursBesides the fact that I still cant figure out the exact name of the place I dined at inside the Huether Hotel There are multiple food joints located literally within steps of each other  it kind of feels like one giant house really Id like to point out that this review is for the food up the narrow flight of stairs And yes I am taking a wild guess that it is called Barley Works Bar  GrillAnyway despite the average reviews this place has received I really did want to share something great about this place I wish I could say it was the service but from the few times that I have been here I have to say that its truly a hit or a missBut dont let that stop you from coming for their chicken wings For all of you who have tried Mortys wings and use that as your benchmark for chicken wing greatness I challenge you to try the wings here You will be pleasantly surprisedThe trick here is to get the breaded chicken wings with the sauce ON THE SIDE If theres one thing they do absolutely great here its the way theyre able to bread the chicken wings to achieve this fantastic crunch This is why its important to get the sauce on the side so as not to mess with the crunch The size of the chicken wings is pretty substantial too for those of you who care about the size heh Although its priced a little higher than Mortys wings its definitely worth trying"

    "review":"This is a great spot for pub food and good beers Live music is often accompanying the night and the ambience is really cool Lots of locals not too many studentsIt is a bit small but this is helping to create a warm atmosphere tooI like Failte in uptown WaterlooAbsolutely great environment super beer authentic feel and vibe and very friendly Food is good basic pub grub Nothing fancy lots of it and maybe a little too much batter on the fish and chips but all the same bountiful and deliciousThis is my goto bar in the KW area Some might call in a hole in the wall but its just the perfect pub During the summer they have the patio open but for the remainder of the year seating is indoors It isnt the biggest pub so seating is limited giving the pub a cozy atmosphere Tuesday nights are trivia nights with a wing special By far my favourite night to go to The crowd is great the trivia master is hilarious and the service is amazing The bar has specials almost every day and so you can pick and chose which nights work best for you The pub does have one large TV and 4 smaller ones so its not your big time sports bar but if you wanna enjoy a game or match with a small group its an ideal spot to check out The best wing flavours are: Dry Cajun Hot and Honey Chilli Lime and Ultimate Sriracha Other recommended menu items include Fries pickled spears and their burgers The menu is the same as Molly Blooms closer to the universityGarbage Unless youd prefer to get drunk not worth eating here I imagine the cook must be 12 yes old and just wants to get home to play his Xbox The food was burnt and the fish tasted like a carnival corn dog mash up of undercooked fish and gooey batter Mmmm yum Can I have some more pleaseWe went on a fairly slow Tuesday night earlyish for halfprice wings and a couple of pints The waiter was friendly when he was actually around but after taking our order for wings he disappeared and served the patio crowd despite the fact that we were the only sitdown table in the pub We didnt see him again until well into our time there I had to go up to the bar and ask for blue cheese dip and celerycarrots to go with our wingsFailtes is also known as being a very authentic Irish pub with a great atmosphere but the music piped into the place was awful Nickelback and something that sounded like heavy metal At one point it seemed to switch onto some loud spokenword Dave Chapelle comedy bit replete with gross language you mf b f you n that went on forever Who wants to hear that in a pub The wings themselves were pretty good nothing to write home about and certainly not on par with any wings chain in town The veggies were limp a bit spongy and cut very thin while the blue cheese dip had no actual cheese in it and tasted like bottled salad dressing The real kicker Despite the dip and veggie sticks being on the menu as included with all wing orders we were charged 2 for them on the bill When I asked a staff member why we were charged for something that was to be served with the wings according to the menu he said that since it was halfprice wings night they charge for it as an extra This little extra wasnt mentioned anywhere on the menu or on any wingsrelated signage in the pub What a gouge I hope my 2 was worth it  after that experience I wont be back nor will my husband or any of the people Ive told about itExcellent pub with one employee that ruined the experience for me and my friendsOn the night of Saturday September 12 2015 three of my friends and myself were disgusted with the attitude of the bouncer on duty to the point where we will never be returning  The bouncer this evening at roughly 12:30am so technically Sunday the 13th was one of the most sour unpleasant individuals I have ever had the displeasure of interacting with  Upon entering the establishment through the front door no bouncer was present outside of the establishment we were immediately and very roughly asked where is your ID by the bouncer standing immediately inside the door  Upon presenting our valid identification all members of our party age 21 we were less than politely asked to step outside  The bouncer then very aggressively asked each of us individually for our id reviewed said id and then proceeded to quiz us about how much we had to drink on this particular evening  None of the members of our party were anywhere near intoxicated and we were frankly shocked to be asked this question as this is not something we had ever encountered at any establishment before let alone this pub which we previously loved  All of us answered his questions honestly at which point he rudely denied one of our party members entry  Naturally we decided not to enter the pub at all we are entering as a group of friends or not at all scouts honor  None of this would have been an issue if it were not for the sour grumpy and unprofessional attitude of this particular bouncer  It would not be an exaggeration to state that this individual acted as if he had a stick up his ass pardon my French but it was clear that he was suffering from a superiority complex of some sort and he made the decision before checking our identification or asking us any questions that he did not want us to enter the pub purely based on young student appearanceYou have lost four customers so long as this individual is employed"

    "review":"355Thai Bistro is located in the heart of Belmont Village which I must say is quite a unique community in Kitchener Before entry it does look like a completely run down place ie: hole in the wall establishment but dont let that scare you awayI ordered a chicken pad thai along with a glass of water Overall the pad thai was decent except the fact there was an imbalanced proportion of noodles and other ingredients and it felt like I continuously ate chicken bean sprouts and carrots instead of the noodles themselves Sad though since I found the noodles and sauce very tasty and the chicken not very specialService was okay however I had to wait about 510 minutes for an employee to come out and clear one of the tables since all the tables were covered with plates I arrived at the tail end of the lunch rush Also at the end I had to wait about 5 minutes for an employee to come out and ask for the bill It seems to be a family joint with only 2 maybe 3 people working so I can somewhat understandI will also try Northern Thai in Downtown in the near future and will make my decision on which ones betterabsolutely wonderful experience thanksMy favourite place to go for Pad Thai The sauce is just right not too sweet or spicy Some other places are too ketchupy flavoured but its done well hereThe price is perfect too 895 for pad thai that can usually be split between two people You cant beat thisNot the best Thai Ive had and Im not sure its authentic but good flavour and taste Would try againFor Thai food in Waterloo this is a 35 The Shrimp Pad Thai is greasy but tasty so its a tradeoff one must be willing to make in order to enjoy the dishThe solitary man running the cash register is at once friendly and impatient I understand youre a busy man but would a smile kill you broChop sticks are a must If you cant use them dont eat here Thats not a policy of the restaurant its just a code I believe everyone should live their life by and if you dont then shame on youWith all these positive reviews here it must be our bad luck when we had dinner there few months ago when my husband and I first moved into the neighborhoodWe used to live in Asia Hong kong and Mainland China for about 10 years and Thailand was our goto holidays destination We used to eat Thai food at least once a week  From eating street meat in Thailand to trying new restaurants in Hong Kong and Mainland China We are just Thai food addicts  PS: Also seriously addicted to seafoodfrom raw ones to cooked ones and Indian food as wellUnfortunately I have to say the dinner we had at THAI BISTRO was the worst we have ever had heres what we ordered:1 Tom Yum Kung  I would not called that Tom Yum at all It was a clear chicken broth with 4 or 5 over cooked frozen shrimp some mushrooms some Spring onions and vegetables in there seasoned with some vinegar and couple drops of chili oil floating on top We both had one sip and that was it it literally taste exactly like each of the things I just mentioned put together in the broth and bring it to boil for about 5 minutes  no spices no aroma not even a hint of lemon grass or some chefs uses coconut milk  but just simply nothing herepeople who loves Tom Yum would know what I am talking about just a bowl of chicken broth with a bit of vinegar and chili oil  2 Spring roll  not any better than store bought boxed frozen ones 3 Pad Thai  I know the fact that a little bit of ketchup is part of some Pad Thai sauce recipes but what we had was more like a bad greasey Cantonese style stir fried beef rice noodles  that went wrong: Cantonese fried beef noodles uses dark soy sauce and it is delicious if you do it right  But the pad thai here tasted like Cantonese fried beef noodles with a little dark soy sauce WITH very little bit of ketchup  something was just off or missing in the taste There was also no lime no crushed peanuts served with the dish and there was no chili fish sauce available :4 Yellow Curry w Chicken  most watery and blend curry I have ever had again no aroma not even a tiny bit of kick on the tonguethe potatoes were not cooked long enough in the curry it was not soft and a bit  mushy as it suppose to be instead it was just simply cookedit had no taste in the center of each chunk : i ordered a portion of white rice and tried to eat it but it just turned into turmeric chicken soup with rice  as it was just too thin and watery  We ended up taking everything home other than the Tom Yum since i have chicken broth at home lol and remade it into something more edible since I hate wasting food  I would usually give most places a second try if the food were just a  little off  but this one was just way too far from just a little off for us I genuinely hope it was just a one time incidentmay be it was the chefs day off Who knows for the restaurant Cos if that was their normal standard I am worried for them"

    "review":"This is some of THE best pizza ive ever hadIts decently priced around 7 for a full large one topping pizza its perfect for a night after partying when you just need something to eatI used to get pizza from here all the time but recently Ive found Twice the Deal to be a better pizza place Biancas offers the same things as Twice the Deal but at a slightly higher cost also no dip The only thing I like better about Biancas is their large juicy tomato slicesThe pizza is good when they get the order rightSeriously I was put on hold several times during several orders at several points in the evening 7PM 11PM 1 AM and all three times I was put on hold for over 5 minutes I ordered a 3 topping special multiple times and twice I got pepperoni only never ordered pepperoni at all and the third time I showed up to be told my pizza had not even been madeThe shame is the dough is decent as is the cheese when hot The people behind the counter dont give a shit about the customer or their order There are plenty of other places in Waterloo for pizza Its a shame the people working here ruin itThe place is pretty awesome and it has affordable pizzaThis is the pizza company many students in the KW region should consider ordering fromI went and got their large pizza pickup special for 8 The price seemed really good but the pizza was a bit smaller than what I would expect from a large pizza Also the crust wasnt didnt have a crunchy bottom layer and the tomato sauce was too salty for my taste However it was very cheesy which I likedLooking for a good pizza at a great price  Look no farther than Biancas PizzaBiancas is close to where I work and I have always found the pizza to be consistently good but the prices are even better: you can get a large threetopping pizza for pickup for just 999 plus applicable taxes  The pizza is always made hot and fresh and they dont skimp on the toppings eitherI definitely recommend Biancas Pizza if you are looking for pizza in the area"

    "review":"Went for breakfast for a change today and had the steak and egg special for 1395  Ordered the steak rare and I have to say they cooked it perfectly and it was nicely seasoned and tasty  It was rare juicy and tender  Best piece of meat Ive had in a long time and about half the price most places would charge  The eggs were properly cooked easy over as well  As usual they had the best coffee in KW a bottomless pot of itVery good we had 2 turkey dinners with all the fixings great food great staff and with coupon 25 with tip for the 2 roast turkey dinner and 2 soft drinks come with soul and rice pudding  The rice pudding was great soup very hot cone asap to this placeWent for breakfast on a weekday Our server was friendly and attentive Coffee carafe left on table for instant refills Decor and dishes are dated but in a fellgood nostalgic way Our food arrived quickly and was great Homefries are made from scratch with real potatoes just the way we like them Reasonable prices Not one complaintWe come here fairly often as the prices are good and we live close We almost always get breakfast either at breakfast time or the all day menu Although there is often a long line they work fast to get everyone seated in a timely fashion We typically get the only male waiter Ive ever seen there and he rocks Service has always been quick and efficient Their breakfast options are great everything from regular eggs and bacon to pancakes which are HUGE to omelets and skillets Love that they leave a pot of coffee at the table Only fallbacks are that the orange juice isnt fresh its bottled and the decor is a mind boggling random assortment of modern and grandmas house Only had dinner here once or twice I couldve just made the same thing at home Overall amazing breakfast place if you dont mind waiting a bit Pricing isnt too badI love Country Boy  I have been taking my family here for a long time  The owner really cares about his customers When he sees my elderly grandma in line he takes her by the arm and seats her before everyone in line  The food is always great and the service is always speedy  Oh and they give the table an entire pot of coffee so you dont have to constantly be waving down the server  Excellent value for dinner out I would recommend it to anyoneOne of those holes in the wall If by that you are explaining the unkept 1970s feel the decor gives off It has the atmosphere of a place your grandmother would want to go to and then complain about All that place is missing is some disoriented lunch lady with half a cigarette in her mouth throwing your over salted meal in front of you Besides the gross atmosphere with their food to match i have never seen an owner of a place thats been in the food industry for so long publicly humiliate their staff quite the way this gem does I tipped out of sheer embarrassment for the staff So if you like a place that cant be bothered with any quality or upkeep and love eating with a crowd that makes you feel you are in a Walmart this is the hole you have been looking for Is there anything thats good there you ask You bet They leave the pot of coffee at your table so you dont have to communicate with this embarrassing establishment as often"

    "review":"After reading the reviews and hearing Uptown 21 from my friends I finally went to Uptown 21 Wow what a night The food was delicious yet different than regular western restaurants It was something a foodie would like The waiters were pleasant and he informed us that there was Iron Chef happening after dinner We stayed behind and enjoyed a night eating snacks and drinking martini while watching Iron ChefIve been here twice and both times been kind of disappointed The atmosphere is your typical fine dining experience with the service being pretty standard as well However the food was a big miss for me both times The first time I was here I remember the food just being overly salty which as one could imagine interfered with the flavors and taste of the dishentree The other time I was here everyone in my party just didnt like the food for one reason or another This level of food quality isnt really expected at this price and we basically decided not to come here againThe food here is amazing : The menu has a great selection of fancy items and everything is delicious The worst part of the experience is closing between what to try on the menu hahahaAll of their appetizers are delicious I especially recommend the calamari and fois gras I got the 50 steak when I went The steak was really good but the sides it came with were mediocre fries veggies etc The desserts are also all really good ie creme brulee maple pie and chocolate jar cakeThe only thing is that parts of the restaurant is poorly renovated which takes away from the ambiance Like the bathrooms are not nice at all but it does have hand towels instead of paper towelsIncredible food in a nice atmosphere Attentive and knowledgeable service Have never been disappointed by the delicious food First time having foie gras was here foie gras bites and I was blown away Always able to find many things on the menu that you will surely want to eat Highly recommend this place to anyone in KW looking for an amazing mealMy wife and I ate her on Saturday and in a work brilliant  We have passed this place for years never venturing in but we finally dropped by Saturday Why did we wait so long  We had the Prix Fixe and were blown away with bacon wrapped peaches and a smoked trout cake appetizers  For the mains we had the lamb shoulder and chevre chicken and dessert was donuts and creme brulee  To complement we had Beaus beer bargain price Each course was a complement to the previous and were absolutely delicious  In particular the polenta was delicious and I find that this is a side that can go drastically wrong and has in may places we have dined  Great night well be backPricey and somewhat slow service though the amazing meals are worth a stop We first tried to get in on the dmfamous tapas Tuesday but were not able to without a reservation We returned the following night for the normal menu The boar patee was very good especially with the incredible sourdough bread The mussels were also good though somewhat small individually and the fries they came with were more of a standout The local craft beer they feature was also very good and had some excellent varieties The cottage pie was also excellent and I loved the free bowl of bacon they offer on the side it went very well with the heavy pie The mini donuts were also excellent and I loved the ice cream The prices were on the high side for the area though it is a very upscale locale Also service was pretty slow with sizeable waits for the drinks appetizers and main courses"

    "review":"They offer the best lunch special with great choices Their curried chicken have amazing flavors and portion sizesIve only tried a couple Caribbean places so I was anxious to try this one The fact that its 30 seconds from my hotel was a real bonus Cafeteria style service but the lady behind the counter was super friendly offering suggestions and offering to mix the mold and hot jerk sauce to give me medium I had the small jerk chicken dinner with the soup The server said try the soup its good and boy was it A few tender peices of beef and just the right spice The portion of rice with beans was very generous and the jerk chicken was perfect Cooked just right and nice mix of spice with a bit of a hot burn at the end I was definitely full but not overstuffed They have a larg selection of drinks especially Caribbean ones and juices Id like to try the mango or other juice next time as its a good match with the spice I went with a Ting grapefruit soda a favorite from my visit to Jamaica and it suited the meal well Too bad I did not have room for a Jamaican patty or a  desert both looked good  All total 14 for a great meal and a drink is very good value The atmosphere is clean but not really much It would have been nice to have at least some Caribbean music in the background I will go back againReally good chicken curry They also sell delicious flakey Jamaican patties and a variety of ethnic drinks I recommend the pink Ting which tastes like Fresca but obviously betterI love this place Although its not a place to sit and dine more like a cafeteria The important thing is that the Caribbean food is great Roti is my favourite We ordered doubles last time we were in and my only complaint was the microwaved them and over did itWanted to try a new place in KW and decided on this one  5 of us total and we each ordered a different main  I had the curried beef and tried the oxtail jerk chicken and curried chicken  All of these items are delicious but I cant say enough about the oxtail  Planning on going back and trying the goat and hopefully even more dishes  Amazing food :Im a big fan of Jamaican food so when I moved to Kitchener I saw this place and was dying to try it Ive had it a couple of times now and its one of my favourite places to pick up a quick dinner on my way homeI got the small curried chicken dinner both times which comes with a large portion of rice and peas with the curried chicken poured over the whole thing With that you also get a fried plantain YUM and a side salad Its a lot of food and thats just the smallThe flavour is good but I like to put extra hot sauce on it to kick it up a bit more Im gonna have to try the other dishes soonThe service is quick and efficient and the place looks clean inside If youve never had Jamaican food before and are curious about it this is a good place to go"

    "review":"I went for lunch on Sunday with a group of friends and the experience was okay  nothing horrible and nothing greatWe were one of the first groups there so they werent busy and the food came quite promptly They had a sauce bar which is an interesting idea but the sesame sauce was a little too salty and diluted than I would like They didnt put out the fried buns and spring rolls by the sauce bar until we are half way through the mealIn terms of the food it was typical hot pot stuff but definitely had a good variety Nothing tasted amazing and I wish they would state what the items are a little louder We had someone with a food allergy in our group so it was important to us to figure out what is being served especially for fishballs and meatballs Also I thought their handmade noodles were fresh but they turned out to be dry noodles which was a little disappointing Some of the items in our order got mixed up a bit and some never came but they were small side items so it didnt bother us that muchThey only had ice cream for dessert and there was no choice of flavors  I think each day they have one flavor to give out The odd thing is when I asked what flavor they had for the day the waitress told us she doesnt know and we dont have a choice and we have to order to find out I dont necessarily like every ice cream flavors so that was quite annoying It turned out to be green tea which was fine but I think the system was quite flawedAs of now they take cash only which caused a bit of complications at the end of the meal They said they will have the machine in about two weeksHad an awesome server Metilda Food was delicious and place was cozy My two friends loved it It is pricey thoughAuthentic Szechuan style hotpot Super nice waiters and great service Modernized decoration and everyone had great dining experience We found this place on the way back to Michigan this made a grand finale to this Canadian trip Would suggest to all our friends Definitely will come back againI didnt go in with too high expectations since Ive received mixed reviews from people but I was pleasantly surprisedService:The service was GREAT Im not sure if its because there werent many people or because we spoke Mandarin but they checked up on us often the food came fast and they asked us for our opinions at the end on what they could improve onFood:Variety wise Ive never seen a larger hotpot menu than Morals theyve got basically everything you can ask for even seafood and vegetablesThe food itself was pretty great too though not exceptional or anything everything seemed fresh and tender similar to the other location in Markham no complaints thereSetting:The interior was really nice with good lighting and booth seats not dirty or anythingThe only gripe I have with this place is its price even though it was a pleasant experience I had a hard time justifying the cost 3040 as that is around 15x of other hotpot places in the areaOverall if you havent tried Morals and have the budget for it go for itMy first time trying hot pot so I cannot compare with others but i liked it  staff are very friendlySo pissed off We went there at 10:11pm and this app says it closes at midnight Their store said it closes at 11pm and they said they were closed so we had to find something else nearby You should not advertise you close at 11 and not be willing to take people in at fucking 10 They let someone in right after us as well we watched as he walked inUpdate the close time on this app  change the time to close for 10pm instead of 11pm Then we would not have bothered driving all the way here to try and have hot pot here and would have gone to another hot pot place that I know would have been open to serve us at this time"

    "review":"Terrible experience Service isnt geared towards nonChinese Heard about the pan fried dumplings decided to give them a shot The front woman didnt take her time to listen to me or the order  and gives me a plate of pork buns instead Go up and ask for dumplings says they are all out Waited 20mins for nothing Friend who accompanied me ordered the koangpoa chicken and got a plate of peanuts staledry rice and fatty pieces of chicken Thank god she didnt charge for the buns after I returned them Will never go againIll start off my review by noting:MANAGEMENT HAS CHANGED as of November 4 2013In short that means none of the dumplings mentioned below as the couple described in the older reviews has moved back to China the new owners tell meA lot of things on the new menu eg DUMPLINGS were out of stock when we went After further discussion it seems as though theyre still undecided if theyre going to offer it even though it was on their new Grand Opening menu Almost chose braised pork in chestnut sauce 899 to find out the daily special on a handwritten board was also out of stock Ended up substituting chicken and having an eggplant dish 799 for two hungry peopleThe food was good freshly made for us I am still sad about not eating dumplings however However the price is high as those two dishes plus two bowls of rice came out to 20 and some cents definitely not what we expected to pay for the quantity of food If we paid 5 per dish I would consider coming back but not at this price which I consider too expensive for fast foodNo wifiAbsolutely horrible Ive been there twice and both times I got completely different types of noodles They tasted the exact same The only difference was the size of the noodles Never going there againThe food used to be quite good but since the change in management theres been a steep decline in quality nothing tastes as fresh or carefully made We had an issue with delivery as well Despite being only 10 minutes from the place it somehow took nearly two hours for the food to get to our house When it finally got there the food was okay  the crispy potatoes with beans in spicy sauce were the best thing I ended up pretty sick the next day so I dont think well be ordering from there againMy mind keeps going back to dumplings  Yes theres a great Chili Chicken and also an excellent Tom Yum Soup even a superlative Pad Thai with Shrimp  But I keep going back to the dumplingsThe owners of this small newly started restaurant the place has just recently opened in the waning days of August replacing the shortlived Hibachi Express and the even shorterlived takeout version of OYummy Sushi are a Chinese husband and wife team  The wife of the pair is a master dumpling maker with all manner of steamed dumplings pan fried dumplings chicken dumplings pork and vegetable dumplings  I have been eating dumplings for days and days  Her husband has his specialty in making Thai dishes in addition to the native Chinese dishes and in between the dumplings I have been going back for their tasty Thai and Chinese food  But I keep going back for the dumplings  I think you should give them a tryYou can always trust a recommendation from Vincent Tried it last night to ring in the new year after Les Mis Unfortunately there were no dumplings left to be had but the pad Thai spring rolls and mu shu chicken were really good Will be back soonThanx Vincent"

    "review":"They have dim sum at this place which is quite strange lol The prices are on the higher end for this place so its not as popular as some other restaurants at the plaza I ordered the chicken feet too hard and taro pancake no real taro in there The total came in above 6 which makes it not as worth it for lunch as places like Waterloo Star for a lunch meal given the contentFood is decent had a beef stir fry dish my first time here which was quite good and I would recommend it A second noodle dish I ordered had so much sauce it was much too soupy Another thing to note is that the staff have no idea when to bring out the food This time my second time here received dessert first Quite odd even for restaurants not known for their serviceEating food here is like taking an oral oil bath The dishes are literally drenched in oil highly fitting for the tastes of their ethnic clientele The wooden buckets used in some of their dishes serve nothing more than a novelty factor Many of the meat dishes are not very fresh and unsurprisingly the heavy seasoning of spices aid the masking of their lacklustre ingredients The rice is again subpar lumpy and dull without much texture serving as a basic staple for Chinese restaurants this is grossly disappointing"

    "review":"My 1 favourite restaurant in KW I spent 5 years in this city as an undergrad and I was introduced to Guanaquita in my last year of school Id checked out a lot of different food places in KW but the food here was by far the best Oh and its also got terribly fabulous service If its going to be your first time there try out the Platter Its a great start :The only con is that its a bit tricky to find as its hidden upstairsReally liked the place: great food and atmosphere Try the platter to feel the taste of SalvadorI havent tried many Mexican food places in KW but if you are in mood for some then you will likely be hard pressed to find something better  Not a fan of salvadorian cuisine so I stick to their Mexican menu which is delicious  Ive tried enchilada and burrito both of which were great  Family owned whos owner I spoke with and was told by him that his wife and mom do the cookingI want to start by saying that this used to be one of my favourite places in town and my goto spot when I didnt want to cook lunch or dinner since its right across the street Going out to a restaurant is about the overall experience though and not just the taste of the food Guanaquita serves up delicious food its the service Im disappointed in The last three times weve gone we have waited over an hour for pupusas and our orders havent been correct two out of the three times It isnt because the restaurant was packed unless you consider 6 tables to be packed but rather because the kitchen and service is not efficient at all I would never have written this review just based on one bad experience but it has been three in a row now and the staff and owners have not made any improvements This is what happened on our last few visits:We waited 50 minutes just to get our drinks for two people 2 waters 1 beer and had to ask multiple times There were 6 tables in total seated at the restaurant so there is no reason to take 50 minutes to bring a table 2 waters and a beer After getting drinks we inquired about when our food would be ready The server replied well we have to finish serving the table over there first I asked if that meant they were serving one table drinks appetizers and meals before serving other customers and she said yes I suggested our food could be prepped after serving the table of 6 sitting near us their appetizers We didnt order appetizers just pupusas She insisted that they had to serve the table of 6 their entire meal before making our food Ive worked at a restaurant when I was younger and I know how restaurants run Even with a small kitchen there is no excuse for service that is this slow Sure enough once the table beside us fully cleared out they started making our food while informing another table that they would get food when ours was finished This is ridiculous and if the kitchen was working efficiently there would be no reason why multiple plates cant be prepped at the same time If you go to a place like Taco Farm where there are only 2 people working in a very small kitchen youll see them prepping food for 78 tables at once and they make every minute count Another great example is Ellisons Bistro in downtown Kitchener small restaurant but magical and incredibly efficient serviceIt ended up taking 1 hour and 32 minutes for pupusas at Guanaquita on this last visit When they brought our food it wasnt even the right order but there was no way we were going to risk waiting another hour and a half for the right order to be prepared so we just ate what they brought usEven after this experience we returned to Guanaquita because like I said before it was one of our favourite spots Then it happened again and again with friends we brought with wait times of over an hour for pupusasThe food here is good Its really good I just dont want to wait that long for my food and I dont think it would take that long if Guanaquita committed to being more efficient as they grow Service is most important to me and what this says to me after so many meals weve had there and so many people weve brought in is We dont care about you as a customer Guanaquita let me know when youre ready to improve how you serve your customers and well be backLoved this little gem Got the traditional platter and enjoyed every bite to the last Staff was super friendly and took pride in their food Would definitely recommend for either dinner or lunch or a fun evening with friendsGreat lunch location tucked away on King StreetIts a fairly small location right above a bar You need to go up a rather smelly staircase from the smokers idling outside to get to this spotThat being said the food and service was great We went for late lunch and it was a quiet little spot The waitress was awesome and she recommended several dishes and was extremely helpfulWe sampled from the Guanquita Combination platter from the traditional Salvadorian menu section and it was more than enough food for both of us although one person can probably finish it all if you really tried Great place and I would go again to try more"

    "review":"Went here when I was in Kitchener Ontario visiting an old buddy from back in the day Food was decent wings were breaded not my preference Hot though Pricey for the quality 15 for a wings dinner in a little college townThe wings here are of excellent quality You have a choice of original which I prefer or breaded which they tell me is the popular choice There are plenty of flavours as well dry rub such as west coast and your usual mild medium hot Then there is sweet Thai I just mentioned the ones I enjoyed You can also ask for them sloppyThe Wings Up is expensive buy worth it for really great wings and courteous serviceim not sure if what i ordered is an indication of the entire menu but the breaded hot wings were something i will be sure to avoid in the future too much breading which became really soggy and a wing sauce that was less than desirable for a place dedicated to serving wings i had much higher expectationsLove the wings  tried several of the hotter flavorsWow what an awful experience Ive had originally at the Kitchener location and then trying to let the management of WingsUp Know took 3 months Heres my original posting:The food is amazing  Have had wings up In many locationsHowever This Kitchener location has the absolute worst customer service ever  The guy who answers the phone manager  owner  is a jerk and has no ability to explain or even be polite I then called the head office and left msgs for managers Also emailed the website It was returned stating the email address box was FULL Then I started letting people know on the Facebook group and Sharon  who works in the social media field for WingsUp   Wouldnt have guessed thou  asked me to resend the email I originally sent   So I didAnd didnt hear anything again No reply what so ever  3 months later I asked her again and she had misplaced the email and I should send it again I was shocked I explained the situation again and asked her what has or would be done to see better cx service at the Kitchener location  And she didnt reply would hide my posts then ask the sameQuestions again  This process was repeated for a few weeks After a few weeks of checking in she states the manager was talked to and the issue was resolved  I thought the cx service in the store was bad but it seems the whole company may be too busy talking about wing deals  and not making sure the cx service is up to par Avoid the Kitchener location at all costs Update:Robert I sent you a MSG online but no reply Plz put your email up and ill pm your email address to resolve this ongoing issue Any new updates  My friends accidentally went to the Kitchener location a week or so ago  No changes yet from what I was told  Rude manager etcHey Robert   Sent you some info online after searching for your contact No reply Put your email up and Ill email you ThanksCraig"

    "review":"I had AYCE dinner postgameFood was quite good however they messed up our order a few timesService however was bad Waiters were kind of throwing food onto the tables constantly rushing themselves Students come here often to eat so it can be busy at timesLets start off by saying that when rating an AYCE sushi establishment its only fair to compare it to other establishments in the same categoryWith that baseline I think sushi 99 does an excellent job with providing great tasting sushi and a very good price I would definitely rate them above Yes any day but lower than Yummy Yaki The service is fast but the server might not always speak English  however this has never seemed to be a problem in my experienceThe restaurant is usually very busy and if you are trying to have a quiet dinner then you should skip this place as that it unlikely to happenOverall this is one of the top AYCE sushi places on the bang for your buck scalePlace is good for lunch Dinner cost more but the sashimis nor other dishes justifies the cost There are better Sushi places like the izakaya place in Kitchener or if you are truely lucky then itaemi place in King StreetGood quality sushi with a decent variety of dishes available Went there for lunch with some friends and it was a pleasant experience The dishes came out very quickly which was good as we were pretty hungry Barley tea and water are complimentary The sushi and sashimi were fresh For the price that you pay the experience was pretty satisfactory If youre looking to satisfy your sushi craving this is the place to head toCame for lunch on a Saturday The restaurant was not very busy and the servers are quite attentive which was nice However the food was mediocre I did like their seaweed salad  it was quite refreshing Also the kalbi beef was good But other menu items are not very exciting They misread my order sheet and brought something I did not actually order but I decided to take it anyways Overall I find it on par with YesI came here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night and it was still about a third full We were greater at the door and service was very willing to explain any menu questions we had and were very kind The food was fresh and well presented The menu was large and there was a lot of opportunity to explore new flavors My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they had many options for her to enjoy Food was also fast to the table The only problem was that we felt a bit rushed as there was some miscommunication between the waiters and we had one come after the other asking if we were finished after we had sent in another order Other than that it was a great modern sushi dining experience that had a good environment to the dining area and great fresh food I will be going here again soon Make sure you get a deep fried banana before you leave Maybe 2 "

    "review":"I went to this place with my wife for an afternoon snack To summarize everything:Location:The place was cold tables crammed togetherNot very appealingFood:The pizzas choices are very limited and you hardly get any toppingsOrdered Margareta pizza with etra toppings that you have to pay extra for and they forgot to put on the basilPizza tasted very bland  without sufficiently being seasoned overall flavorlessA can of pureed tomatoes on your pizza isnt called saucePrice:Overpriced Do not recommend this placeIm not the biggest pizza fan We came here on a weeknight and there were many seats available maybe because it was almost 9 pm The lighting was dim and the waiters were somewhat attentivethe stone oven was cute though The awkward thing was that the bench cushions sunk down a lot and it was much lower than the chairsThe menu was almost all pizza with different toppings I was most excited about getting the mozza balls which were the special of the day When they came two of them were squished and didnt even appear ball like anymore It came in a lot of tomato sauce and a bit of parmesan on top The mozzarella was melted and in a good amount It wasnt really worth the 2 dollars each We got two pizzas BBQ chicken and Don Andreas to share among three people I didnt really find anything too special about the quality compared to frozen pizzas The crust was burnt in some areas the cheese wasnt generous and melty and there wasnt much toppings in general I did enjoy the Don Andreas more because the avocado was a fresh addition and a side bowl of hot sauce complemented it wellThe pizzas were pretty expensive for what was served around 17 dollars for a large and 11 dollars for a small I probably wouldnt come back for dinnermaybe lunch howeverFamoso in the heart of uptown Waterloo is the closest you will come to real italian pizza in the region As someone who used to live near italy and misses the true thin crust fresh topping style of pizza finding this place was a godsendI usually get this for lunch as I work near uptown The portion sizes are perfect for lunchtime and it is priced accordingly The pizza and salad combo makes it feel like youre being at least a little bit healthy while ordering pizzaTheir blue cheese and walnut salad is simply amazing Im sure their other salads are good too but after trying this one the first time I went Ive not been able to bring myself to have anything butCertainly the best pizza in KW The red pizzas were absolutely solid but I found the white pizzas to be a little dry and lacking cohesiveness We went in January when they were having a Margherita special for 8 a pie so not sure I would come back again at full pricesMy wife and i tried out Famosa for our date night and were pleasantly surprised The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious only downside was the service Our waitress seemed to forget we were there and also when my wife ordered the vodka and blood orange Italian soda which it clearly was not she claimed it was I guess we werent the only ones that got the same treatment as we saw her and her manager at a table having a talk later in the evening We didnt complain but i guess others must have Another waitress then took over midway through the meal which was much better For our starter we got the prosciutto wrapped mozza balls to share which were great although for 19 bucks a little overpriced for what it was For our mains we shared the Verde Sauted kale caramelized onions roasted garlic goat cheese Kalamata olives and Cavoletti Ovenroasted Brussels sprouts prosciutto crisps gorgonzola cheese dates walnuts drizzle of honey The Verde was okay but the Cavoletti was AMAZING Such a great mix of flavors and balance of sweet and salty We ended the meal with 2 scoops of salted caramel dark chocolate gelato to share No complaints theredelicious Overall it was a great night some  issues with service but apart from that we had a great time Would go back for sureI love coming to Famoso I come here multiple times a term I always order the same pizza Prosciutto  Arugula its sooo good highly recommend And get the mint gelato"

    "review":"as a ramen connoisseur kenzo is a staple for consistently decentaverage ramen that is conveniently close to uw campusive tried just about half the menu at kenzo and very few of the items have disappointed to be specific their attempt at introducing a don menu oyakodon etc was a bust the rice was mushy and the taste overall was just bland and nothing special however items like the king of kings and tonkotsu are good enough for me to want to go backservice is fine wait times are finepersonally kenzo is among my favorite places to eat in the barren wasteland known as the uw plazaIf youre looking for fairly decent ramen in the Waterloo region this is the place The ramen offered at Watami Sushi Bar pales greatly in comparison to that of which is at Kenzo but thats to be expected considering that Kenzo is primarily a ramen shopThe waits are long on weekday afternoons due to the lunch hour rush of university students so it is best to visit there outside of those hours The staff are kind and respectful however during the rush hour it is quite slow In terms of decor the restaurant is welllit and quite clean But of course the ramen is the star of the show I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which was 1095 not including tax Overall it was a decent bowl but still requires improvement if you are used to that which is offered in Toronto or Vancouver The pork has a good distribution of fat and meat which was not tough at all I think that the noodles could be a bit springier but thats of my own preference The egg was disappointing instead of a yellow and slightly runny consistency it moreso resembled a hard boiled egg The stock was fairly good nice and creamy The bokchoy is a standard offering at Kenzo stands which was well cooked but did not really complement the other flavours Portionwise its a bit small for almost 11 All in all my experience was decent Going outside of the lunch hour should improve the service however While the ramen isnt amazing the option of having ramen in Waterloo is still far better than none at allNew place long wait what else is new If you are from Toronto you would be used to lining up for ramen places though but never really quite sure whyThe ramen is standard kenzo so noodle is a bit chewy What I liked was that the stock wasnt too salty Not sure if portion is too small or price is too high again standard kenzo so not really directed to this particular restaurantThe takoyaki was quite okay a satisfying snack eat to end the meal on a good noteI would say this is a welcome addition to the plaza landscape may be tempted to visit again on cold winter daysKenzo Ramen serves an excellent bowl of ramen Glad to see some quality food return to the plaza Definitely recommend going early before the line formsDidnt feel full after eating a Shoyu Ramen and its quite pricey Wish service could be better one of the server wasnt very wellversed in the difference between the bowls Only one credit card machine so it takes a while if youre the third table waiting for the credit card machineProbably the best ramen restaurant in the University of Waterloo plazaIt is not as good as the Kenzo Ramen restaurant in downtown Toronto lacks flavourThe price is high for the quality You cannot wait in line inside of the restaurant therefore you have to wait outside because there is usually a line of 5 of more people waiting Not comfortable in the winterThe creditdebit card machine does not workService was fastThe restaurant appeared to be run by Koreans rather than Japanese people So its not legit ramenWill probably not go often I would rather have ramen in Toronto where the quality justifies the priceDelicious I was worried with all of the notsogreat reviews on here but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal I got the Nagasaki Champon Ramen and my friend and I shared the Takoyaki I cant remember what she got but she loved it Everything was delicious The staff were friendly the waitress didnt talk that much but she was friendly regardless Overall a great experience We will be returning"

    "review":"Well I never thought I would give a keg a 3 star but here it is  When I attended the place was pretty buisy but the service was still fairly reasonable  The waitress I had was new and still in training but she did a great job I had ordered the NY peppercorn strip with fries  While waiting for my food I was treated to a bowl of homemade chips which were delicious and then their standard bread  which unfortunately I cant eat   The food was a little slow coming out and when I did get it my steak was a little over done and not much peppercorn sauce as far as flavor it was still goodI feel that it they still want to keep their higher prices they cant let the quality slide  But besides this experience Ive always had good luck with the Kegs in the past so I would still recommend trying itExcellent surf and turf You can always count on them to cook a steak properly Lobster tails were also great Good service The bar is real nice out front to sit and have a drink while you wait for a table Make sure you get reservationsAh the Keg Very nice atmosphere and service I ordered a ceasar salad sirloin steak and garlic mash All very good but not really interesting Expect to pay 30 a person You are paying for the service not the food Fancy place for boring foodThe keg delivers a quality product at a steep price But all in all once in a while it is worth it in my option because the overall experience here is excellent Steak is always consistently good here and the French onion soup is to die forAmazing steak Dont recommend prime ribs If you love medium well order medium here If you love medium order medium rare here I found that they always over cooked the steak a little bit But overall most tender and juicy steak Ive ever had in the regionOne of my favourite places in KW Always a good meal friendly and a great evening It is expensive but worth it"

    "review":"I come here every once in a while to pick up some Borsht Its home made and quite good They also have sour cherry perogies which are quite difficult to find and theyre willing to make custom flavors for you which is cool Overall a nice and cozy mom and pop sort of place I give only three stars for 2 reasons:1 hours of operation are limited  they close at 3 pm every day and are closed on Sundays Thus the only time I can visit is on Saturday mornings when Im usually pretty busy2 their menu selection is pretty limited beyond the two favorites I postedGreat for tea and and an AMAZING pastry Cant get enough of their pastriesnot too sweet just rightVisited on a weekday and had pelmenis for lunch There were a little more greasy than I hoped but they tasted pretty good The price was reasonable as wellThe borscht is nearly as good as my mothers which is very high praise as anyone who has been to my house knows But actually the food is apparently all homemade and it shows as it is the closest to authentic russian food as I have ever had in a restaurant The pelmeni were also fantastic perfectly cooked good meat too Served in a traditional little ceramic pot thing with butter and sour cream on the side it was delicious That on its own would have been enough for five stars but on top of this it was less than 15 everything including The only other meal that cheap that is filling delicious and tastes like home cooking is actual home cooking And the lady behind the counter who also served us was really nice and made me feel like I was actually at homeIm definitely coming back to this place to have tea and desserts but I wouldnt hesitate to get that awesome lunch there eitherThe borscht is really good Really unique dont know anywhere else in Waterloo that even makes borscht The perogies were really good too and the owner gave us extra She is really nice Amazing service and we were treated kindly given extra bread and sour cream when we needed it etc Never had Napoleon cake before and it was dope would absolutely recommend Its a really cozy and personal spot"

    "review":"I came with a friend today and we both had the Pork Bone Soup Special for a reasonable 1185 after tax This is the dish that the other reviewer Jennifer L is referring to when she says that the Pork Bone Soup has additional sweet potato noodles and tofu added I dont think the regular Pork Bone Soup has these addonsThe soup came out hot and bubbling and had just the right amount of spice The portions are very generous and I would have easily been full eating only half of the portion given Service was prompt and the couple running the shop seem very friendly Its true that the potatoes arent as crispy and yummy as those from Seoul Soul but the soup itself doesnt have that layer of orange oil youd tend to see at Seoul Soul The main dish itself shines even if their banchan game isnt as strong I would highly recommend Sowon if you want a cheap hearty filling Korean meal in the Plaza :Come for the pork bone soup leave because the service is bad This place is okay Its owners are the same as Dawon in the plaza a restaurant that never impressed me The food here is good The special pork bone soup is interesting and the meat falls right off the bone However having potato noodles and rice is redundant The pancham are middling at best and the jjangmyun was lacking substance The prices are okay The kamjatang is overpriced if you get the special although I suppose you are paying for tofu and noodles The jjangmyun was not worth it Service here is bad They are understaffed slow and when I asked for extra bowls which come automatically at owl  our waitress completely forgot I tried to wave her down but she never came back or even looked at our table I had to stand up at the counter to pay and waited about 5 minutes before she even took my money Really bad service They need to hire more people or pick up their feet Overall if you want to come here get take out Also they take credit which is nice since not all plaza restaurants take creditI had the stir fried rice cake which was okay but nothing too special There was not a lot of vegetable in it which was disappointing In general I dont find this place interestingI come here pretty often typically at least once a week and I love it The lady is always super nice and the food is always on point Also the side dishes are the best Ive had and they have free refills for them The restaurant typically isnt busy its either steady or quiet whenever I goMy second visit to sowon I ordered gamjatang and the soup tasted really bland  The meat wasnt tender and I couldnt taste the seasonings at all The side dishes tasted really off especially kimchi  I would probably never dine in sowon againThis place serves good Korean food and the lady is always nice and sweet Only issue is that I think theres only one cook so if theres a lot of people you might be waiting a long time for your food Other than that definitely give this place a try"

    "review":"The food is decent but the servers are good The place is extremely crowded during lunchtime and if you come with a partner chances are youre going to have a double date with the table next to you because of how close you will sit next to themOther than that the prices are good The portions arent too bad either Overall everything is mediocre The food is typical fastfood Also dont get the shrimp fried rice its literally fried rice with 3 small shrimps on top of it Dont get the soon tofu either because if you are a firm believe in soon tofu youre going to regret it I believe the chicken bap should be the best pick if you dont know what you like yetCame in when it wasnt busy Ordered  the dolsot bibimbap and kamja tang Both dishes come in the hot stone bowls When they came out they were sizzling However after maybe a min at most it stopped The dishes came out quickly so I can only assume that they didnt properly heat up the bowls The bibimbap was alright Vary few pieces of meat Which tends to happen but not to this extent It was nearly nonexistent might as well call this a vegetarian dish Also because the stone bowl was not hot enough the rice didnt crisp up This dulled the experience Flavour is to be expected of bibimbap Also dish cooled quickly as the stone bowl was not hotThe kamja tang has an anchovy soup base to it that can be taste not necessarily a bad thing However it did come out luke warm and quickly became cold There wasnt a spice level option which makes me think that there is a large pot of kamja tang already warm and they just scoop it into the bowl I could barely taste any spice in the soup Wish it was a bit spicier Overall and alright dish but Ive had betterSide dishes were nice Really enjoyed the potato and cucumber Kimchi was only ok Gave this an alright experience If youve had amazing korean food this is only alright Given that I came at a time that was not busy would have expected better since they could concentrate on get their dishes perfected If I have a korean food craving I may come back But I will return to my hunt for a good korean restaurant in KWCame here on a couple of occasions I got the pork bone soup the first time it was really good However I do agree that the wait is a little long when the store is busy Located in the plaza its a very small restaurant Not ideal for big parties but if youre going for a quick korean bite with a few friends this is the place Food comes very fast and with a variety of side dishes 4 Upon recommendation I tried the bulgogi The portion was a little small but taste was good I love soon tofu so I got that as well Compared to some other ones Ive had this one was a lot less spicy But still very good If youre someone whos not into the hassle of eating pork bone soup and cant handle heat this is the soup for you here Overall good service and yummy food If you love the side dishes dont forget you can ask for refills side dishes include potatoes kimchi bean sprouts and pickled cucumbersshould really be a 255 rather than a 2 because relative to the pathetic standards of the uw plaza its not terriblewill be a more concise review because ive actually had the pork bone soup hereheard generally neutral to good review on pork bone soup i can say that its ok but nothing to write home about price went up a dollar or so from the good old days but its still cheaper than everything else on their menu its basically soup with a single potato chunk and like 34 chunks of pork bone along with a bowl of ricedae love sides at korean places this place is the same god i love sidesmy friends who ive gone with have tried other things like the bulgogi beef and the sweetsour deep fried pork they were generally neutral to dissatisfied with the other menu itemsprice is quite pricey for how small the portion sizes areProbably my favorite Korean place in walking distance of the university Good price good foodYou cant expect authentic korean cuisine in waterloo I would say nuri village is soso i had jeyuk bogguem which is suppose to be a spicy pork stir fry but  it tasted sour for some reason I wouldnt be a regular but if i crave for korean food i would visit"

    "review":"I tried their lunch buffet yesterday during my recent visit to Canada If you are a vegetarian they dont have much option in their lunch buffet as it happen to me and two other guest who were also vegetarian I like their naans Saag paneer was ok disappointed with Chana dish Dal makhni was my favorite dish in the buffet Overall ok place but dont think I will try this place againSorry to say that the buffet was terrible and the services not much better My complaint about the food is that the dishes at the buffet table were not quite warm and the food had no flavor hard to do with Indian food I was told by the server to use plates instead of small bowls for main dishes I like to use bowls so the saucy Indian dishes wont get all mixed up in a plate He pointed to a sign saying this when he noticed me trying put to goat curry sauce in a cup This is the first Indian place that told me not to use bowls bowls were evidently meant for desert only so I asked why and the guy there said so they wont have to wash so many bowls Hmm OK  One good thing that came out of this is we didnt have to pay a lot to find out we never want to go back I have probably been to about 30 Indian restaurants most of them in California and this one takes the last prize  far behind from all the restPlaced a takeout order with a couple of friends in person They said it would be a 30 minute wait and refused when I asked to pay right away We agreed and walked across the street to our hotel We returned 25 minutes later to see our receipts still sitting at the cashier The host told us they had no idea if we still wanted our orders because we left and that we shouldnt have left if we wanted our food to be ordered Ridiculous and incompetent service not to mention the blocked off windows to hide the kitchen No idea how this place is in businessNice and simple traditional Indian food Not overpriced We enjoyed goat curry  naan and chhola baturaGood buffet with five or six entrees plus salads and desserts Inexpensive The staff are friendly and efficient If you want staff to fawn over you dont go here But if you want to be treated like a regular person by regular people this is the placeI stopped in here by chance last week and was pleased to find a cheaper alternative to eat The hosts are nice and the buffet is quick easy and had several veggie options so there was no problem there We went there a second time this week and arent disappointed with the food If you are looking for a fancy fine dining experience there are better options but for 10 I cant complain and it will be a place to go if we are in the area at lunch time again"

    "review":"Pricey and a bland menu  I had their mango salad and it was very very badTastefully decorated it feels a bit pricey for what you get but I find its competent  Ive been here a few times and most recently today for lunch Ive only ever come here for lunch  Its not that large of a restaurant though it has a nice deck during the summer  They havent changed their menu in the last 23 years since Ive eaten here  and the specials have stayed the same though I think the prices have risen  There are 4 specials at 1399  and I typically have the Spinning Noodles their version of Pad Thai with Chicken and a Mango Salad note that its not a Green Mango salad on the side  Both my client and I had the specials  a side of two fresh rolls rice noodle wrap of white rice noodles  vegetables and shrimp with a vinegar dip and it came to 48 pretip which is on the expensive side for lunch for the area not to mention they were lunch specials  The spinning noodles as pictured were decent  I thought the noodles might have been just a tad hard but thats pretty subjective and it really was a light tamarind sauce  not too heavy  Unfortunately Waterloo doesnt have very many or very good Thai restaurants  Theres limited 1 hour free parking on the side street and a larger parking lot with paid parkingDecent thai fusion place Atmosphere is OK service is pretty good Price is a bit high for the area especially considering that there are quite a few other thai places which are just as good or better with a 10 minute walking radius I go here when im in the mood for thai and am with people who dont necessarily like it  There are quite a few items on the menu that arent super authentic  So I get the curries and my friends get stuff like pad thai the one they make is as authentic as sweet and sour chicken balls at a mall chain or steak So although I dont come here super often the place isnt bad and it definitely has a niche carved out for itself As a caveat stay away from the mango salad Ive sent it back twice because the mangos werent ripe enoughThe food is pretty good but I dont understand why their lunch specials are so expensive I once ordered a pad thai to take home to my husband after I dined with a friend at lunch and ended up like 40 in the hole Brutalthis place is quite pretty and the service wasnt too bad when i came here with a large group IMO they spent too much effort making the food look good than taste good cue ketchupy noodlesThis is my goto dinner place with my boyfriend and friends We make every excuse to go here and probably average going 35 times a month I have tried the Beef Jerky appetizer and the Red and Green curries I havent tried anything else on the menu because the curries are so good The vegetables are always fresh and the food is always steaming when it comes out  I would also reccomend their ginger tea The service here is great and the food comes out extremely fast you never have to wait more than 10 minutes Often the owner is there and he will greet you as you come in  I reccomend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great Thai food at a reasonable price"

    "review":"I had lunch there on Saturday I probably had a 35 experience however it was probably my fault I ordered medium hot Cajun spicing when I should have ordered mild When I was 40 I enjoyed hot spicy food but now that I am 70 I should remember to tone down the amount of heat I had a whole lobster it was very fresh with side orders of fries sweet corn and sausage Other than my mistake it was a good meal Service was quick and efficient Their Ipad menu was easy to use At that time of day I was the only customer ordering boiled seafood however I was told that it is much busier for dinnerIt appears that seafood boils began in Louisiana but became very popular in Los Angeles when The Boiling Crab opened there I read that other seafood boils quickly set up in competition in L A I even found a Facebook page for a L A restaurant called L A Seafood Boil At this stage it is too early to know if seafood boils will become popular in Canada Not everyone enjoys eating with a bib and plastic gloves The only utensil I was given was a shell crackerThis restaurant is OK but in some ways is a fraud It does not offer genuine Louisiana Cajun style  boiled seafood According to their website it does offer a Los Angeles style seafood boil I doubt that a Louisiana seafood boil would say: No forks or chopsticks Los Angeles is a long distance from Louisiana Louisiana is the home of Cajun food and boiled Crawfish not Los Angeles The website mentions cajun blend of spices Hint: Old Bay Spice and secret sauces there are a lot of not so secret recipes available on the internetP S The web site no longer mentions Los Angeles Still L A stands for Los Angeles while La stands for Louisiana The food itself is quite acceptable Since you are given a bib and have to eat with your hands expect the experience to be a bit messy The restaurant itself is curiously located inside 168 Sushi next to the bar The interior design and washrooms are very nice A couple of Cajun Seafood Boil chains have started up in Toronto I expect that it will only be a matter of time before either The Captains Boil andor The Boil Bar opens in Waterloo I have tried them and they would be formidable competition if they open in Kitchener or WaterlooThis place is located in the sketchiest area ever It is literally IN 168 sushi We waited 40 mins to get seated when the restaurant was obviously empty The food also took very long to arrive The taste was mediocre but the whole experience was really not worth it It is also on the very pricey sideUnfortunately I wouldnt recommend this place"

    "review":"Well maybe not quite as good as Babcias but darn close A nice variety of fillings and side saladsA nice change from the usual burger and pizza takeouts Hope they do wellMy mom picked up cheddar cheese pierogies and meat pork and chicken ones with carrot salad beet salad and coleslaw sides They were still warm fifteen minutes later not overly soggy or crispy and covered in sour cream onions and real bacon bits Not the fake stuff They also have soup and shakesWe agreed that we liked the cheese pierogies best The sides are nice and refreshing For a person who cant stand coleslaw I was impressed It didnt have a strong mayonnaise flavour but a pickle one instead which was kind of weirdCant wait to come back and try the blueberry onesThe family running this place is very sweet and kind I believe it was the mother and one of her daughters who welcomed us to their restaurant as if it was their home She talked about polish tradition and how the perogies are made The moment I saw their grandmother walk out of the kitchen with a fresh batch of perogies I knew this will be an authentic experience I have to say that the price you pay is quite expensive for what you get 6 perogies with a bowl of soup comes to approx 17 To be completely honest I felt the perogies were a bit bland and was just unimpressive The salads were refreshing but nothing special as well It simply did not justify the cost The soups on the other hand were absolutely delicious I really enjoyed their garlic and pickled soup They were very hearty and flavourful I would highly recommend trying their soups over their perogies Overall the experience was quite neutral The food was AOK but quite expensiveI love perogies The best ones Ive ever had were in Montreal So good So when I found out the was a new perogie place near my home I was excited pros its evidentnthe perogies were super fresh and i loved that i could top them off with allthe fixins ie sour cream bacon onion etc love the assorted flavours as well Also restraurant super cleanCons price For 6 perogies and two sides quite small i fell that 11 dollars was a lot Especially since the perogies were quite smallAlso felt the staff who were super young 1416 lacked people skillsOverall it was ok Nothing special nothing badReally delicious but has its downfalls The pierogis are so good im in love with the mushroom and sauerkraut What an interested flavor combination It just melts in your mouth I really want to try their garlic soup looks neat The pierogis and The service is slow so slow I work nearby and often dont actually have time to eat my food before my break is over The price is a little high too im always left wanting moreIt could easily be my goto but instead this restaurant is more of a once in awhile treat for meI love pierogi house The staff are so so friendly service has always been quick and the food is amazing The pickle soup especially is to die for and the cheddar pierogi are so good Im rarely in Kitchener anymore but I stop here whenever Im nearby"

    "review":"This is the best restaurant in the KitchenerWaterloo areaJanet Lynns was pretty much my entry into fine dining as I grew up and went to university as an incredibly classy and romantic anniversary Its been my go to place for special occasions ever since The menu doesnt change much but the service is just so attentive that It keeps me going back The room is lovely and maybe a bit stuffy but it is a welcome change from the restaurants that are closer to the universities I did feel out of place at first because we were the youngest people there but our waitress was so nice and helpful with everything on the menuwine listWhen the food came I did scarf it down possibly to the chagrin and scoffing of the table next to us but it was so delicious The duck and chicken were so delicious as was the creme brulee for dessertForget Symposium for first dates take himher to Janet Lynns for something romantic memorable and elegantIve become a regular at the new location because it offers the best food wine and service in the KW region  Ive dined here many times for lunch and dinner it never disappointsMy only suggestion is to change the menu from time to time or offer more specials  I wish there were more places like this in the areaThis was an amazing dining experience The food was fantastic we tried the burger and the curry dish and both were fantastic Talked to the owner for a little while and got the history on the building theyre now in Ordered one of their carrott cakes to go and was pleasantly surprised Great experience especially at the price pointService: FantasticAtmosphere: Intimate and invitingFood: Delicious and wonderfulWould return YesMy girlfriend and I were feeling like a night out so we did a quick search of bistros in the KitchenerWaterloo area and selected this one at random Boy did we get luckyWe were immediately greeted by friendly staff at the door who kindly took our jackets and showed us into the dining room The place was softly lit with a cozy bar open kitchen which you could sit at and an eating area with enough space for everyone to feel comfortableWe decided to pass on the extensive wine list but if anyone is curious about what wine would go with their meal just ask the staff would be happy to help you I heard and saw this happening at a couple tablesThe menu was incredibly varied for being so concise with something for everyone If you still found yourself with nothing to order the features and specials would no doubt entice youWe settled on fried calamari to start which came out in quick order and it was a great introduction to our meal The squid had a light flaky batter just crispy enough and while it kept a familiar texture it was not as chewy as some places It was accompanied by a light salad and spicy aioli which was creamy and added a nice little sizzle to the end of each biteAfter a quick clearing of the table our mains were brought out mine a half lamb rack with sofrito potato pave and my girlfriends roasted duck breast grouped with celery root puree and seasonal vegetables one of the features I had ordered my lamb medium rare and you could have taken a picture of it for a textbook The meat melted in my mouth when I bit in and a smile came to my face when the flavour washed through The sofrito and potato pave were great sides adding a little spice and grounding respectively While I did not have much I was able to sneak some duck and puree The duck was excellent as well not greasy or fatty and the puree was nice and creamy bringing a little something when paired When our waitress came around asking about desserts we nodded excitedly While their dessert menu is full of delicious plates we decided to go with two of the specials: a flourless chocolate cake and a layered budino The consistency of cake was so smooth it felt like I was eating velvet fudge with a rich dark flavour Few times Ive had flourless cake but this was so far the best The budino had a chocolate cookie crumble base with a rum custard topped with caramel and a dollop of whipped cream While both were excellent the cake won out for me but then again I am a chocoholic so take that with a grain of saltAll in all it was a fantastic night: great service excellent atmosphere and wonderful food This place is wonderful for a business dinner date having a catch up meal with a friend or if someone is just looking for a nice meal Thank you very much to Mr Kevin Wong and his staff for having such a wonderful establishmentI went to university in Waterloo in the 90s and stayed for a few years afterward to work I am now in Long Island NY but was back in KW to meet up w my UW friends We selected JLB  When I lived here and JLB was in uptown Waterloo I had heard fantastic things about this place But I had never been so I was very excited about going Truth be told I came out a tad disappointedWill start off w the good:Service was fantastic Attentive without being overbearing they understood we were reunioning and were not intrusive in any way despite our slowness to order  Server knew the menu very well and made great recommendations  Perhaps I am now a dumb American but I left an extra 50 bill for my chequeck and the waitress double checked my generosity Very honest of her  Stupid new 50 designsI have never really cared about ambiance but the place is a little loudThe food was ok  Unfortunately I began this review 2 months ago so I cant remember exactly what we ordered  I do remember our general impression after leaving was that was ok but not great Overall I am giving this place 35 stars which is heavily influenced by the service we received   Breakdown: 5 stars for service 3 stars for food  Ambiance like I mentioned I usually dont care about but but it was loud  Fortunately Yelp doesnt do half stars so yelp rating  is 4 stars"

    "review":"Wow  I went there on recommendation of a colleague and I was NOT disappointed  They have all you care to eat for 20 with a mindboggling number of choices  The food was excellent and the service was great too  Im shocked at the great value at Yummyaki  Its probably a GREAT thing that theres not one in my neighborhood or Id rarely see my familyAfter reading other reviews from other sites too I think it is nice to mention that they have added sashimi into their dinner menu  This is a smallmedium sized AYCE sushi restaurant Something about the store maybe it was the lighting but it gave me a dirty feeling The staff there werent extremely fluent in the English language but still provide adequate services They checked up on us regularly maybe every 15 minutes or so and provided new order sheets after taking in your orders although they did forget once The salmon sashimi have a fish taste to them so thats a good sign The sushi isnt packed with rice either The kalbi beef was also pretty good although 1 order only gets you 2 pieces of short ribs They provide a pretty big selection of food and specialty rolls But the hot sauce they use in their spicy salmon was a little off the maki rolls were cut at weird angles which turned them into uneven pieces and the sashimi portions stay the same whether you order 10 pieces or 6 pieces They just cut the pieces smaller if you order 10 LOLThe major issue I have with this restaurant though is actually how they limit you 1 scoop of ice cream But this is an AYCE restaurant I thought in my headI always get 3 scoops of ice cream after an AYCE meal I know Im such a fat ass Denvironment: 35service: 255 no free smiles herefood: 45 for an all you can eat placevalue: 35 Standard prices here but I want my ice cream :Cbetter than most all you can eat but would not come backGreat customer service and for the lunch ayce its definitely worth the price There selection might not be as big as 99 but the quality is still thereNothing special with their rolls Not the best but not the worst Good service however and I love their udon thoughMy favorite sushi restaurant all the timeSmall restaurant difficult to bring groups to Sushi is better than OYummy but is slower to come out Menu has less variety than other places Ice cream and orange slices  are limited to one order per personFrustratingly certain items on the AYCE lunch menu were not available when we ordered such as kalbi beef"

    "review":"Im rating this restaurant 35 starsI came here with my family for dinner and we ordered from their All Day Lunch Special Menu   We had: Tandoori Chicken with basmati rice salad  mint sauce Chicken curry with basmati rice and Brinjal Bhaji Eggplant curry with naanWe ordered the curry dishes with medium spice and it still had a bit of spiciness but we want to try it with more spice next time  The two curries had their unique taste  It was rich and flavourful yet not overpowering  The tandoori chicken was seasoned well very flavourful  Although one chicken leg was spicier than the other  The naan bread was very good  I dont like food that is too greasy so I was happy to bite into naan  that was soft and chewy and did not have much butter left on the surface The basmati rice tasted good  just your typical basmati riceThe restaurant is clean and the staff are very friendly  Service was good  The portions were okay  Expect rice or naan to take up more of your plate than the chosen dish for the all day lunch specials anyways  However we were full and we will definitely be visiting again  Also there are lots of vegetarian optionsPlease note that if you want to pack up your leftover food you need to pay extra for the takeout boxes I dont remember how much but it was probably less than 1Do not order riceI ordered the Kashmiri Chicken with basmati rice and when it came I eagerly tucked into the rice while I let the chicken cool a bit As an Indian Ive eaten rice my entire life and I have never had rice that bad It tasted like it was refrigerated overnight and then microwaved before serving or just severely undercooked When I told the waiter and asked them to substitute for naan he said something to the effect of:Your rice is fine Its the same rice everybody in the restaurant is eating You can order naan on your own if you wantSo I just ate the chicken by itself which was okay but I wasnt expecting much from plaza food Five minutes later the waiter came back with free naan which was admittedly quite good All in all I might go back but Ill always get the naan over the riceThis is a really great place to try out curries within the Waterloo region I believe that this is the only Bangladeshi restaurant there is in Waterloo and it was the best representation of that particular cuisineIt is conveniently located in the university plaza too so it is a great place to walk to The staff there is friendly and the place has a pretty good ambience that is good for a typical ethnic restaurant One of the best things is that a lot of their curries have slight variations of spiciness in them If you are one to hate spicy food their butter chicken is the best bet Otherwise there is not much to eat for people who cannot tolerate spice as most of their meals have varying degrees of spicinessFor those who love spicy food try out their samba curry which is rated 3 chillies most spicy on their menus One of the employees told my friend that nobody was able to finish the samba completelyOne bad thing however is that 10 for a plate of butter chicken with 4 chunks of chicken breast and rice may not be the best value for money Overall a great place to eat out but with issues regarding lack of variation of less spicy foods and the seemingly overpriced foodThe store front is unassuming walked past it for years before going inHowever the food is the real deal Really delicious curries and amazing naan The food tastes fresh even though its curry and apparently really healthy for you too Service is a bit lackluster and the prices are a bit highOverall would recommend this place to othersBest food in the plaza in my opinion The Tandoori chicken with Naan is amazing especially with the yogurt sauce I get it nearly every weekday Price is fairly reasonable for the quality of food you are gettingBest IndianBangladeshi food I have had worth visiting There is probably nothing I can specifically recommend everything is worth trying Also the Nan is out of this world good"

    "review":"A community centre cafe Cheap eats Espresso coffees Free wifi Great vegetarian food at incredible prices so that people of all incomes can afford a nutritious meal here All are welcome Volunteers run the Working Centres cafe Lots of comfortable seating including a window bar Local arts and crafts for saleSuch a wonderful idea  having volunteers run a cafe that is accessible for all in a relatively lowincome community Food ranges from 26 which is incredibly cheap and its delicious too So far Ive been 3 times and each time has brought with it fantastic food and a warm welcome The first time I had the chickpea burger it was my first time having a vegetarian burger so I wasnt sure what to expect You could tell they were homemade and had excellent flavour  almost like hummus but more spices and a different texture Very enjoyable : The second time I had Ethiopian lentils with rice which was deliciously spiced and flavoured and even the basmati rice was perfectly cookedToday I had the tomato and peanut soup which hit the spot on a cold day  especially when I was feeling a bit under the weather Each time Ive been here  the staff have been very friendly and the food comes within 5 minutes even on their busiest days The restaurant is very clean and they provide board games  cards  and books Theres an espresso bar which I have yet to try out but it looks great too Overall  I would highly recommend this place Theyve got a great selection of vegetarian food at fantastic prices and youre also supporting a good cause  helping lowincome people in the community to eat healthy  affordable mealsThis is an awesome gem in Kitchener  Great inexpensive fair trade coffee seriously one dollar  delicious chickpea burgers only 350 and fabulous vegan options  Free WiFi and a perfect community feel You wont regret it"

    "review":"Great dinner with friends cozy atmosphere and great service Only complaint was I found it a little noisy with the restaurant full Will definitely be returningThe Oysters Rockefeller were a total rip off  The oysters were so tiny we could not find them  The Moroccan Lamb was just okay  It was tough and chewy and the flavour was only ok   The stuffed port tenderloin was disappointing as well  Just barely ok  Had it not been for the 30 off tonight this meal would have really irritated  The best part of the whole thing were the desserts  The cheesecake and the key lime pie were very very good except you do need a knife to cut through that filo cheesecake  Probably will not be returning  Oh and the noise level  just one more reason to stay home Way too NOISYNow Im really irritated reading a review left two weeks ago where the birthday girl got a surprise dessert  We got NO surprise dessert and they knew it was a birthday they brought a sparkler and charged me 900 for the dessert Their review is now dropping to a 2 from a 3The service was excellent the manager  ownder not sure who he was very charismatic and outgoing he really wanted to take care of us and make sure we had a good time Id say the service here is an AThe food doesnt live up to the image this place gives off  or maybe I just had the wrong dishes I had the Seafood Paella which is a Saffron infused rice with PEI mussels black tiger shrimp calamari strips chorizo sausage black olives sweet peas and sofrito It was pretty good but I probably wouldnt try it here again The mussels were very hard to get out the shell for somereason here and kept breaking I think they were overcooked slightly The Shrimps were pretty good thoughAlso tried the fried risotto balls which werent that good they were pretty boring and nothing interesting there The escargot tower was better it was presented well and was pretty tasty I havent had escargots in a while until that day I tried the gnocci and king crab dish as well it was also pretty averageIll take into account what other people thought at the table  there were mixed reviews but most people didnt think it was anything spectacular Also the meals were very pricey so if I was to pay full prices for what we ordered Id be pretty disappointed Came here for a birthday on Tuesday so it was 25 everything on the meal 30 25 and 20 off Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays except DecemberDinner on Monday got 30off Food is pretty good I love oyster really fresh Cheesecake is great I may come again just for this Pan seared crispy skin salmon is also tasty I love sweet pea mashI went there for Valentines Day dinner The appetizer calamari was decent But the main courses were rather disappointing I had the seafood paella and it was quite below my expectations My boyfriend was not too fond of his dish either  said the lobster and steak were plainWonderful little place in Waterloo was there last Monday and benefited from their Monday 30 off everything promo  What a deal 1 Escargot Tower was amazing2 Fresh Raw Oyster were great 3 Double Pork Chop  mmmm Thick juicy tender YUP  I would go again"

    "review":"Being Japanese decent its nice to finally have decent AYCE sushi in KWThe quality of the nori seaweed used is much better than the local competition The rice is cooked and seasoned usually fairly well considering its AYCE although the quality does fluctuate slightly depending on how busy it iswhen you arrive Like all sushi places there are some bizarre nontraditional items on the menu which can be experimented with The avocado pineapple is actually pretty good Unexpectedly they actually do a good ratio of ingredients to rice which is rare and sets them way above the competing sushi place The grilledfried items are soso and I always consider them like side dishes to the sushi they are typical to AYCE that is usually very oily and rushed Stick with the salad and perhaps a few pieces of tempura The service is very friendly although they do seem to get a little flustered when it is busy Part of the reason being is that they take your orders table side but as a result they rarely lose items The presentation is usually done with care and the young manager or owner takes great pride in the food which is obvious when he personally brings your orderOveral the best choice for sushi in KW and for all you can eat the quality is surprisingly good Do try to go for lunch rather than dinner and arrive early The quality will be the best at these times and it is significantly cheaperOk place for a sushi feast but I prefer going to Yes just a little distance up the road  The fish here just doesnt seem as fresh and tasty as it does at Yes  Some may disagree with me but thats the way my mouth tastes it  Wont be coming back here while Yes is nearbyYet another addition to the ayce sushi field in KitchenerIn comparison to Yes I feel that Sushi star has better quality service as it has a less crowded table layout The food orders were rarely missed which is a bonus compared to many ayce sushi joints I have been to My favourite dish was the Florida roll which combines pineapple sweet with Cheese salty I found the ration of rice per maki roll was appropriate and a welcome change from Yes which tends to overload in order to fill the stomachs of patrons Some of the rolls offered are sketchy at best such as the fried rolls I would like to see the owners update their menu to reflect the customers wants through a survey The price point was reasonable at  14 for the lunch 35 starsPros Service 2 Selection of both rolls and dishes 2 Price 05Cons  Deep fried rolls and rolls which barely differ 1Came here with my family The smaller layout provides for more service attention compared to Yes Food comes out piping hot from the kitchen Rolls taste fresh and are quite large for AYCESome of my toddlers favourites: bone soup edemame spring rolls tempura squid rainbow roll grilled sauryWatch out cuz they charge for kids under 4 Four stars for Star SushiNow my favourite AYCE sushi in the KW area Edit: This was replaced by Kinkaku Izakaya but its a close 2nd and the best budget optionSalmon sashimi is thickly cut and tasty Cuttlefish sashimi came partially frozen Spicy lamb skewer was absolutely delicious grilled and seasoned with cumin Any roll that says it has cheese will have lots more than most usual sushi places and I love it but its not for everyone I find the soya sauce is wateryService is good a pleasant departure from the AYCE sushi places that normally serve students closer to campus The restaurant is smaller and I feel like thats also a big factor in getting better and more frequent service the other being the apparent lack of students Recommend trying the Sweet Sago Pudding  which is coconut flavouredDefinitely go for Monday 1799 cashonly dinner specialThe flavours and freshness abound here Were mostly vegetarian so the sashimi we cooked later at home Tempura veggies are so tender with minimal breading and lots of delicious sauce Our favourite sushi place in Kitchener"

    "review":"The meal was great The price for it was to muchService was the best Most customers are just wannabe foodies Glad I went but once is enoughPublics chill vibe is perfect for any occasion  The music selection is eclectic often funky service is friendly and the food delicious The tapas menu is inventive and dishes are presented thoughtfully Youll love the extensive wine list and healthy selection of unique cocktails  A reservation is advised as tables are in demand  If you go unannounced you might get lucky and snag one of few seats at the bar  I recommend buckashuck oysters on Wednesday with a bottle of Gruner and warm olives to startLove the atmosphere the food is always amazing and the staff are super friendlyPerhaps my review is influenced by the very high expectations I had for this place or perhaps we just didnt order the right dishes but overall it was disappointing  We read the previous reviews which were all glowing but warned against expecting much in the way of dcor but the narrow corridor we were seated in was distracting for whomever was seated against the wall because of the constant traffic from clients and wait staff  Other seats in the place were better but it was busy so we had to take what we got we probably should have just moved our seats to the adjacent side of the table  The wait staff was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu so we were pleased with that aspect of our experience  She brought additional toasted bread to eat with the duck pate and was responsive to requests for additional mustard  That being said based on the food being left behind it was pretty clear we were not enjoying some of the plates but the waitress did not really ask us at any point if we were enjoying the dishes or offer any substitutes We ordered 6 dishes of which 2 were very good two were good and two were pretty disappointing The wine we ordered Tempranillo was very good and the King Street Station beer from St Jacobs was also nice  so things started out well The oysters we started out with were very good We ordered 6 oytsers so they brought two of each kind they were Atlantic oysters but I dont recall the names of them  They were accompanied by a chipotle hot sauce horseradish a vinegrette type of sauce with onion and small diced tomato and a lemon  We like our oysters well garnished so we put a little of everything on them and they were delicious  So between the wine beer and oysters we were out to a good start from a food perspective  The next thing that came was the duck pate  It came with pickles pickled beats Oktoberfest mustard some sort of balsamic raspberry oil some arugala and some crusty bread crackers  The combination was nice and the flavors all worked well together  It was pretty goodNext came the special of the day which was a tuna carpaccio taco with pickled cabbaged and red onion and some sauce  The flavor of the dish was really nice  spicy and tangy and just the right balance of flavors However it was a very juicy dish and the liquid soaked the softshell such that it pretty much fell apart in your hands so it was pretty messy but no complaints about the tasteThe next dish was the carmelized eggplant and deep fried onions with some other stuff cant remember  My colleague had recommended it earlier in the week but neither myself or my wife particularly enjoyed it  It comes with four pieces and we ended leaving two of them  the flavor was just flat and the combination didnt do much for usThe next was the arugala salad with goat cheese and bacon  It was good and there was a decent portion Cant say there were any surprises in the taste but OK it came with what was advertised The final dish was the crustini hambon or something like that and it was all but inedible  I dont recall everything that was on the cracker but there was this mystery brown stuff that didnt look terribly appealing and tasted less appealing We each had one bite and left the other 3 items untouched  It was a little disappointing that the wait staff did not pick up on the left over food and ask if we didnt enjoy it However we didnt want to end on a bad note so we ordered two more oysters to cleanse our palate  They were both very goodWe spent about 2 hours and 200 on the dinner  On some notes it was very good but overall it was not the 45 star Yelp experience I was hoping for  For the price I cant honestly say I will be going back again any time soonCame here for a late dinner on Friday evening its a small cozy restaurant Between the three of us we had 12 dozen oysters escargot fricassee foie gras crostini with prosciutto sausage and apple slaw The food was amazing Everything came in portions suitable for sharing and it was just enough food for us I also had a cocktail with tequila and egg white brulee foamit was interesting Service was excellent our water glasses were always full Great experience though on the pricey side Will definitely be back Best tapas in KWI in town from the OKANAGAN and I found this gem of a great tapas bar on the Yelp appdont miss this place"

    "review":"Burgers are sized for a light meal  Not impressed by quantity or flavor for price I was visiting from the states where such a restaurant would not survive    I guess if you have the right decor and menu that makes the establishment look legit how can the burgers be nothing but superb  They arent so save your money and go to burrito boys   There is a red robin in Niagara where you can try the quality at a chain restaurant and compare it to this jointI dont really understand the bad reviews this place is getting The fact that it almost always is packed and people line up at the door to get a table should say two things: either that Waterloo desperately needs more burger joints or that this place is really good I guess both theories hold water Weve tried burgers in Florida and in Michigan and none of the places we visited there come close in taste to The Works The burger tastes amazing and what I found very appealing the salt is kept to a minimum really enhancing the meat flavour They cook it right serve it right and with tons of toping combinations you cant go wrong Ordered the tower of rings as an appetizer too Really goodThe only downside prices are high 10 for onion rings is too much and all the burgers are at least 12 and additional toppings cost a few dollars each Two burgers a beer and onion rings set us back 60 with tip As another person mentioned this isnt a place where you become a regular but I might add it is a place where you can get your burger fix and feel good afterwardsMy entire family grandparents included have been several times to The Works Waterloo and weve had consistently decent experiences each timeThe burgers are specialty burgers different options for patty size bun options and all the gourmet toppings the menu offers many many combinations with interesting fun names  The fries  both regular and sweet potato  are very good in the style of New York Fries which is the thinner skinon type  The side salad is fine but really nothing specialPrices are exactly what you would expect for a premium burger restaurant  not cheap  Service is almost always prompt and professional the servers are usually very good at offering suggestions and helping you navigate all the different options and combinations  Drinks are generous using measuring cups is a fun signature of the place their milkshakes are very delicious but very filling their tower of onion rings are HUGE  As other reviewers mention the food is slow to arrive expect to wait at least 30 minutes sometimes 45My biggest complaint and its a very serious one  The volume of the music is INCREDIBLY LOUD  Loud enough that we often cannot hear the staff when they are speaking to us loud enough that we cant hear the person across the table talking to us loud enough that we have on 3 separate occasions asked for the volume to be lowered  There is a fine line between a good vibe and simply irritating customers and The Works routinely and regularly crosses it with their music  So its a great place to go if youre young but that demographic doesnt have a great deal of money to spend its not so good if youre a family if youre older if you want to talk to anyone at the table if your entire meal will be spent staring at your smartphone and you dont mind texting your tablemates instead of talking to then Id heartily recommend it  If you want a great burger but a nicer social experience Id reluctantly recommend going elsewhereSo many choices available with adorable lightbulb shakers Ordered the Son of a Beech burger It was interesting and tasted good The portions are huge and you can customize the burger and meal to your liking The service was great and the waitress was super nice Its cozy and comfortable with its industrial designA friend told me about this place and how it was the best burger place in Waterloo He oversold it I had the deep fried bacon with bacon mayo as an appetizer and the Dead Ringer burger The deep fried bacon was really overdone The coating on the bacon was really airy and flakey although really crispy Apparently it wasnt supposed to be like that so Im definitely disappointed with the consistency of the restaurant The bacon mayo didnt add much to the deep fried bacon As for the burger it was also a letdown It consisted of a fried onion ring with smoked brisket and BBQ sauce I decided to get an elk patty as well The burger was on the dry side The patty was slightly overcooked there definitely wasnt enough BBQ sauce I also didnt get much gaminess from the elk Since it was my first time having elk Im unsure if it was supposed to taste as it did but I felt in this case a regular beef patty would have sufficedIt would have been nice to get a more well executed version of the dishes Im sure it would have been better But because of the consistency of food I got this time Im not sure Ill return Well see how it goesThe Works is a fun little place to check out and has great atmosphere but if you are just interested in getting a great burger this may not be the best option They have a massive selection of burgers with a ridiculous amount of variety but the only issue is the burger patty itself arguably the most important piece of the puzzle is bland and forgettable They do offer a number of different party options some of which I have not tried but I can vouch for the standard beef patty and can say that I have had frozen beef pattys from the grocery store with more flavour They offer a number of interesting side options apart from the standard fries including homemade chips onion rings and even steamed broccoli  They have a very steampunkindustrial inspired theme with copper pipes on the walls food served on metal trays jars for glasses etc So once again its an interesting place to check out for a cool experience but definitely not a staple in your life for great food"

    "review":"Id love to give them more stars because the pizza is actually really good but the one time we ordered from there they withheld information from us and made us feel scammedWe had walked by this place many times while walking the dog and saw in their window something about a walkin special  So one Friday night we decided to give them a try I called them up and asked what the walkin special was because I couldnt remember it I asked if it was a large pepperoni pizza for 10 because thats what I thought it was and he said yes thats the special so we ordered that As were walking into the restaurant we see a sign in the window for something like a large pizza with 3 toppings for 10 I realized the guy on the phone lied to me and we were in fact entitled to 2 more toppings to fulfill the walkin special But we went in paid without saying anything and left I was pretty choked So needless to say despite the  good pizza we will no longer be returning here due to the poor customer serviceThey dont provide cups So youll have to drink from your 2L pop with your hands Also the customer service is poorIts my favourite pizza place in waterloo  the pizza always good and the wings test amazingthis my third year going to this place and I have no problems with them  so I highly recommend itIm not sure if this was the location my order came from since I ordered a delivery from 2440000 but I am in Waterloo  SO after them screwing up my order 3 times in a row I decided to call in to politely mention that my wings wer hot instead of mild and that it was now a trend on their part The receptionist  advised to keep the wings and that they wer going to rush a fresh mild order for meI tried getting a credit but she advised that they cant do that and that they wer going send me another orderAt that point I didnt care I figured I would just eat the wings and wedges and not worry about the wings5 minutes later I get a phone call from the store and there is a dude on the phone with broken english pretty much calling me a liar and that he made the wings himself and that  they wer mild His tone and language wer as hot as the useless wings he sent me So I pretty much told him to go F himself WHO DOES THAT   Serisouly After hanging up with him and beeing pissed off enough I cant say I was really hungry anymore so I decided to call back the 2440000  and advised them of the bully attitude one of their franchise had towards their customer They offered me the next order to be free but would not refund my current orderRubbishNot only will I never call them to place my free order with DOUBLE DOUBLE since they would probably screw up my wings and ill get yelled at by some  dude NEVER AGAIN  Too bad since it was by far my favorite pizza and that I used to order every 3 weeks or soWhat a Great pizza I strongly recommend it to all pizza lovers fresh toppings great pizza  an excellent customer service I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT"

    "review":"We finally got up our courage to try Mels again after the disaster we experienced last year  Well this time I ordered the Monte Christo  DRY  So dry I had trouble choking it down The turkey was so dry it fell apart  The thick bread  read Westons wonder bread was barely dipped in egg and fried prior to adding the filling  NOT the way it is supposed to be done which is dipped in egg after being made  I saved the turkey and salty little slice of ham for the dog  Dipped the sad DRY bread in the maple syrup and called it dinner  The caesar salad on the side was good but a small caesar does not make a dinner  The milkshake was delicious as usual  My daughter took a chance and ordered a Jerry Lee burger  It was quite literally dripping mayo and mustard all over her and her plate  Puddles of the stuff  Somebody in there lost their mind putting on the condiments  Her coleslaw was meh  and Im a coleslaw lover  couldnt eat it  The fries were just ok  When she finally got rid of the very soggy bun soaked in mayo etc and tried the burger meat she found the meat itself was delicious  Unfortunately all the crap they drowned it in managed to completely hide the lovely flavour of the burger  The mushrooms  Tasted canned  IF we ever go back it will be to order the burger with nothing on it  Shakes  delightful  Service  very good  Two very pleasant and attentive waitresses  Speed of getting the food  Pretty good and the restaurant was busy  Just wish they would hire a decent line cook  Such a nice tempting menu and twice disappointed nowMels is one of those restaurants that I check up on from time to time because I really want to like it I can say that last visit was a definite step up from before I went during their offhours a bit before most people grab dinner so they were fairly empty The food came out much faster than expected although still on the slower side its looking up from the half hour waits I also noticed that a lot more people showed up for classic car night which was a treat to seeThe new waitress there was very cheery and welcoming It was incredibly refreshing because she actually gave a shit She played the biggest role in the improved experience and shes the main reason Im bumping up Mels from one star to threeMels is definitely my goto place on a lazy Sunday morning for brunch It has all the basics  you get super full from eating there :  the food is quite delicious both breakfast  dinner dishesI also love the ambiance of the place Love the diner theme  its a great place to eat together with friends best with a group of under 6 people so you can sit in the cute boothsHonestly a lot of their menu items are overpriced for what youre getting I got the breakfast croissant which was just a croissant with cheese  guacamole No meat or anything special about it  that was 10 Not worthLove their all day breakfast menuThe food wont blow you away but if you want breakfast for dinner this is a good place to go The portions are fairly large especially for breakfastIve tried quite a few items off their menu and have only ever had one bad experience the fish  chips  oily and just tasted off The crispy chicken wrap is my favouriteIve never had any bad service and one summer I went here at least once a week without getting tired of it"

    "review":"my husband i occasionally went to andys for sunday breakfast when it was located on highland road  i was never a big fan as the tables were really crowded tight together and i always felt like i was sitting on top of the people at the adjacent table  today i went to the new location on strasburg road and had lunch with my sister and my mother  we chose this spot because it was in a convenient location to where we would be doing errands  we arrived at 11:45 am and had the restaurant to ourselves  during the one hour that it took for us to order and eat not a single customer came into the place  my sister and i ordered the fish and chip lunch special which was disappointing as it came with frozen fries the newly opened fish restaurant in the same plaza serves fresh cut fries and 2 pieces of previously frozen fish  mom ordered a western sandwich which she really enjoyed  the new place is much more spacious so the tables are better spaced  used the rest room on the way out and it was not in good shape garbage overflowing from the trash can and the floor looked like it needed a good mopping  we will not be backWent here and got the quality I wantedAndys has moved from the very busy Westmount and Highland area to the Forest Glen Plaza here in Kitchener the previous restaurant at this location has now closed but pretty well everything else has remained the same with AndysThere is a Breakfast Special with two eggs toast and home fries which unlike the breakfast specials of most other places in the area includes tea or coffee and is available until 3 pmI guess the biggest issue I have with Andys is one of consistency  Sometimes the food is good  Other times not so much  Sometimes the service is fast  Other times not so much  I went there once for steak and eggs for dinner why not and not only was the steak over cooked but it took forever it seems for the steak to actually make its appearance  I wend there recently for breakfast with a friend and not only was the food good it seems that the breakfast appeared before I had even finished preparing my teaIf you liked Andys when it was at its old location youll love it at the new one its certainly nicer  My friend who is a fan will agree with me on that  However for me I believe that there are much better places in the area"

    "review":"Best Portuguese Chicken In TownQuite affordable and delicious 12 Chicken  2 sides I chose 2 sides of roasted potatoes because  well they are amazing Not a fan of the rice if you want rice go somewhere elseIf you enjoy spicy food you will find their hot chicken mild however this is the perfect amount of hot for normal palated people Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for roasted chicken that isnt Swiss Chalet As Vincent mentioned the Pastel De Nata are great and recommended for anyone looking for a snackVery Authentic Cuisine 5 StarsI live in the neighbourhood and stop at this bakery fairly frequently for good home cooked food to go  The chicken parm sandwiches are amazing and so huge They could feed two people easilyWent for dinner at Lisboa a few weeks ago Had a quarter roasted chicken dinner with rice and roasted potatoesNot sure if the patatoes were fully cooked but they kind of tasted raw they were served hot from the deep fryer I believe so I wasnt 100 sure if that was how they were supposed to be served or if they were  not cooked enough Had a piece of the blackforest cake for dessert The cake was okay but it was a little stale I dont fault Lisboa for this as its hard to find a fresh piece of cake served by the slice at many bakeries  cafes around town unless you order and buy an entire cake Will  come back to Lisboa again as the service was goodIn a strip mall like many neighborhood secretly good eateries  We stopped by out of sheer curiosity in hopes to find good Portuguese bread  We were happy to find some great tasting sweets  The humble seats were full and their chicken looked good I will have to try it next time we pass byA great Portuguese restaurant very authentic If you havent had the shrimp w garlic and butter they are TO DIE FOR So deliciousStopped in to check this place out today as we were in Kitchener  Since we had already had lunch and it was around 4 pm we ordered the Galao coffee  I had a strawberry cheesecake NOT made here  bought in and my partner had the coconut tart actually more like a muffin or cupcake  The Galao is nothing special  Its a simple Latte  on a par with MacDonalds or Williams Coffee Pub but twice the price  My cheesecake was overwhelmingly sweet to the point where I couldnt eat it  The coconut pastry was heavy as lead dense and had little to no flavour even though there was plenty of coconut in it  Two desserts 2 coffees 14 and change  The server was a wonderful young man who took alot of time explaining the desserts  Yes he got a nice tip even though the food was soso  The noise was horrendous as they were showing the World Soccer matches on every tv there are several and the crowd was drinking and watching the show The restaurant is clean and new not classy  very casual kind of diner style  We found the menu prices to be very high and were glad we had already eaten  A side of vegetables or potatoes for example 699 and sandwiches around 1095  Definitely Toronto pricing here and not what I expect in a plain neighbourhood setting with paper napkins and a large take out counter  We didnt try the chicken so we cant comment on that or the other mains but since the prices are steep I doubt we will be driving there again as there are so many other options  Really I kind of doubt this place can survive with these prices and that atmosphere  The breads are brought in from Toronto ditto the desserts  the only thing made on the premises in baked goods is the Pastel de Nata which was sold out and weve had plenty of egg tarts before now  The chicken was still turning on the grill at 4pm  Everything is overpriced unless you order from the take out menu  Three stars is for the service and to give it the benefit of the doubt"

    "review":"Its so weird to have to review this place and being the first person toIve been there more than 8 times I think Its very very close to the university which is awesome The food is not too salty or oily and is pretty nutritious which is awesome The dinner for 5 feeds my group of friends 8 people which is excellent Weve had the dinner for n maybe 5 times Awesome cheap food just what a university student needs The only thing I wish was better would be the authenticity of the cuisine if we could have Chinese food for that price and not ChineseCanadian food although Ive never tried their Chinese menu probably because I never went there with friends who read ChineseBeen here a while with friends its a great place to eat at for students because its quick decent Chinese food thats near the university as mentioned alreadyThe atmosphere is typical nothing fancy but comfy enough to sit for a whileYou cant really expect too much out of anything at the university plaza because food is catered towards students and they tend to focus on quantity speed and pricing that appeals to students as opposed to quality and service However the food here isnt bad at all and the dishes come in large portions that will fill you up for sure Includes tea in a proper tea pot as well once you sit down a big plus compared to all the other chinese restaurants in the plaza The quality of food is okay after eating a few times at this place you will notice that they tend to use the same kind of flavouringmarinating on most of the sauce based dishes Some things are notably lower in quality such as their lemon chicken plate and I even recall seeing them bring in prefried bags of the chicken Still though they have a decent range of dishes on their menu and some are actually pretty good for a quick meal Just dont think this place will blow you away when  you eat there and you will be satisfiedAverage Canadian Chinese food The serving size is very generous and the food is cheap Dinner for n is the best deal out there if you want fooddollar A good quick fix for university students as well as the fact that the service is quite fastI came here once and probably wont be heading here anytime soon The food is rather salty and oily Service wasnt the greatest either as the server was on her phone and didnt really pay attention to the tables There are better Chinese restaurants around Plus there were flies flying around the restaurant while we were eating so Overall not a great environment eitherDecided to try this place for lunch I dont like exteriors with just pictures and little English I understand the intent of the pictures to show what is on the menu to passersbybut I like to have a sense of the costs and names of menu items to order They did have the English names so I could decide that the King Pao looked like a good option The place was very busy  which was a good sign The interior was much nicer then the outside would imply Rather than wait or share a table with a stranger I decided to do take out and used the picnic tables for the plaza common area The cost was 850 for take out and it includes a hot and sour soup The soup was meh It was hot but with little flavour and a bit of an off taste On the other hand I had not actually ordered it and so I guess I should not complain The King Pao was a generous portion with lots of rice Again hot was the dominant flavour Good value on a volume basis but Im not likely to returnThe service is horrible Not only was the food served 30 minutes after they took the order the waitress was extremely rude When we asked VERY politely at around 20 minutes after we ordered if she can check in the kitchen for us because a lot of people came later into the restaurant and they are served before any of us the waitress started yelling and saying this isnt your home and the chefs are not our f mothers Wtf She did not give us any sort of apology for the food being late but rather she chose to swear at the customers Will never visit this place again"

    "review":"I agree with shane k This place is nothing special And their dim sum is alright My boyfriend ordered the lemon chicken lunch special and I ordered some dim sum His order came out pretty quick however I had to wait about 15 minutes for some of my dim sum to arrive He was practically done eating by that pointThey have renamed themselves Sams Chinese Kitchen  So we went there today and had the Dim Sum  The regular menu items are pricey  more expensive than we are used to paying for the identical dishes at the Kingtin which is why we settled for Dim Sum  Ditto on the Dim sum  They are all more expensive  2675 for 2 people including a single serving hot and sour soup and I left still hungry We waited a very long time for the food to arrive even though there were only two other tables while we were there  We waited so long that when one of the dishes was not available which we waited 20 minutes to find out I was unwilling to order a replacement and wait another 20 minutes  Quality of food  pretty good Tasty freshly steamed the Har Gow are plump and nice the sticky rice with sausage was tasty the chicken and yam spring rolls were quite good and not greasy the service was friendly  The restaurant is fresh and clean and looks like it has been recently redecorated  Because the same dishes are available elsewhere for a lesser cost we will not be returning  I would almost suspect they copied the Kingtin menu dish for dish  The hot and sour soup is identical  The Dim Sum is now available all day and of course all the restaurants buy their dim sum items so these too are pretty much the same as everywhere else with a few exceptions  There is much less variety than you find served at the Kingtin on the weekends  Example  6 shrimp rolls at the Kingtin from the menu 500  Three shrimp rolls at Sams 450 and pan fried dumplings are 8 for 1050  Ouch We buy these dumplings frozen 24 for about 349 at the supermarketDO NOT EAT HERE If you want to sit down and have 4 tables served before you then you should They cater to the Asian crowd much more than any other I sat at a table today and waited for 15 minutes without getting a menu drink or any attention whatsoever There are so many places out there better than this Go to Cameron Seafood instead They have attentive servers and the food is amazingTo me its absolutely the best dim sum restaurant in KW areaMoving from Markham ON where there is an abundant of good quality Chinese Cantonese food we finally found a this place that serves food at the same calibre Definitely going to be a regularNo longer managed by Cantonese people a bit disappointed with the Dim Sum quality limited sauce availability slow service Cameron is much better for dim sum in KW"

    "review":"Got the original poutine for takeout Wow where do I beginFirst of all the fries were soggy and drenched in oil There was practically no gravy on it The cheese curds were hard and old Sadly I had to nuke in the microwave for 4 minutes to get the cheese to partially melt and most of them stubbornly refuse to budge Felt like I was chewing on rubber pellets  Dont let their heavy advertising fool you Id rather go to McDonalds to buy their fake poutine that to pay for this excuse of a poutine This was an utter letdown Im sticking with my New York Fries They get it right every time and theyre even cheaperNice hearty carbs right after a tragic final examMe and my friend shared a Wow size double pork bacon and pulled pork and it was delicious and the portion size was pretty big The gravy is mediocre though not much flavour just feeling really gooey After you had real gravy made from real turkey fat theres no turning back lol The fries were pretty soggy too due to the thick gravy Its better to finish the entire thing when its still hot because after like an hour or so it does get pretty grossGood poutine and nice staff  Live the rainbow veggie poutine  The nacho is also great  Philly cheese is another great option  For people that are picky about the fires I could see how it wouldnt be there favorite but I will point out some people like there poutine like that This place has the perfect food for when youre craving salty junk food : I love the choices for the specialty fries  my favorites being triple pork  hogtown The fries are a bit overpriced but there are a LOT of fries Youre probably going to feel amazingly disgusting afterwards Even though the quality of the poutine isnt the very best Im giving it 4 stars because its just soo satisfying to eat sometimesThe service is fast and the hours are great its open super lateSmokes Poutinerie ReviewWhat we ordered: Pierogi Poutine Triple Pork Poutine Hogtown PoutineWhile Smokes Poutinerie offers only one item on the menu they create poutines like no other Smokes has a unique look focusing on a retro theme and their own mascot you can see and feel the pride the franchise has in their stores and in the attitude of their employees They proudly display the newspaper articles they have been featured in on their walls which gives a sense of community We have been to several locations and each one has offered consistent friendly service and an efficient get the job done mindset During our most recent visit the stores delivery driver returned to the store and made sure everyone was taken care of Considering the employees have to master every aspect of the business from cleaning the tables taking orders from customers and also cooking the food everyone seems happy and proud to work at SmokesThe menu at Smokes is simple and harks on the retro theme throughout the restaurant Under each poutine is a short easy to understand description of the contents There is a very large selection to choose from and accurate photos of each on their website It is a great use of small space and they have enough room to add more if they desire By offering a Suggestion Box right at the counter we are given the impression that they are more than willing to try customers ideas If a poutine is missing a specific item that you were looking forward to you can add it to any poutine for a nominal fee The prices are somewhat expensive especially for a large poutine but guarantee that you will not leave hungry Their selection of beverages we found to be very specific brands not often offered If you are looking for a huge meal that will leave you feeling satisfied for hours afterwards look no further than SmokesWe have enjoyed several types of poutines from Smokes and not once have they skimped on the actual amount of fries or toppings The amount of food given is colossal giving us tasty leftovers on more than one occasion The meat has a delicious unique taste and they are quite generous for what we assume is their most costly ingredient The gravy is really special thick and smoky You can really taste each ingredient separately which raises the question why anyone would choose the plain poutine Poutines are delivered in a coated take out box which works perfectly for the hot fry concoction topped with a nice sticker with their business information We can think of many other businesses that could learn a thing or two from Smokes there is genuine thought and selfconfidence in each locationOur several visits to Smokes have been consistently pleasant the staff are friendly and efficient there is always more than enough food with quality ingredients for the price and the choices for next time keep us going back for more We really hope they will someday soon open a restaurant in Brantford because we would definitely be regular customers Our favourite topping are the pierogis they are so tender and perfectly cooked We have been wondering if they would be willing to create their poutine on top of pierogis instead of fries at a cost of course Just a thought for next time when we have to make the hard decision as to which poutine we wantPrice Range: 499  1299 Atmosphere: 9  Menu Selection: 9  Service: 10  Food Quality: 95  Overall Experience: 95QuickRRMeh Fries are ok Curds wer not fresh Fresh will squeek when you chew and the gravy was too blend Do yourself a favor save your money cut your own fries and go buy REAL FRESH Curds from Sobeys  weber erb on Fridays Pricing is a little on the premium side for such a simple dish and portions are nothing to brag about"

    "review":"Decided to try this place since it is nearby and I had a craving for Thai food Ordered pad thai and thai mango beef stir fry with rice and everything was cooked superb The vegetables were very fresh and the portions were big The meat was tender and the pad thai came with many succulent shrimps Only thing I didnt like was that rice was not included with the stir fry but it was only 175 extra so not a big deal Meal for two dishes was 24 not including tip It is a nice looking restaurant inside and they have a variety bubble teas and desserts as well Definitely a hidden gem in KWyou wouldnt expect a good restaurant in that area They also have a dinner for 2 for around 27 with spring rolls mango salad pad thai and curry stir fry with rice which is what Ill be trying next time And lunch specials run from 795Update: Tried this place again for the Thai Spicy stir fry with hot and sour soup and was quite unimpressed The thai spicy was made with a coconut sauce which is fine however it tasted TOO overly sweet as if they added more sugar to the dish I could not finish it The hot and sour soup was also overly sweetened and more like a sweet and sour soup Next time I order here Ill stick with the curry pad thai pho or appetizers and NOT any of the sweet stir fried dishesRed Ginger showed up on my Yelp map when we were looking for a dinner spot nearby and we decided to give it a try Agree with other reviews  the restaurant wasnt full but they were getting a lot of calls for pick up and walkins for take out Initially there was only one wait staff and she was busy as can be We were left unattended for about 10min Then a second staff came out and everything was a lot better We tried their 27 dinner special  two veggie spring rolls a mango salad a chicken pad Thai and a curry with rice Everything was really really great Really good value for the money too Thought about taking away a star for the initial slow service but the food more than made up for it We asked for a take out menu and will definitely returnExcellent service Clean interior No music And thats a good thing The food was amazing and serve quickly to my table Inexpensive prices RecommendedVery disappointed Went here for a quick bite while out of town before meeting a client Was going to go to a Vietnamese restaurant that Id been to before but thought Id give this a try instead Wish I hadnt I had the pork vermicelli bowl as my main which wasnt awful but not great What was awful where the crispy pork spring rolls Im used to having Vietnamese crispy rolls that are indeed crispy and packed full of goodness These however were packed mostly what seemed to be mashed potato Come on Really I kid you not 90 mashed potato I saw no evidence of veges in there of any kind as stated by the menu description Deepfried pastry rolls filled with ground pork carrots taro black fungus mushroom cabbage bamboo shots and glass noodles served with a sweet chili sauceI thought I had ordered the wrong thing  Ive been to several Thai restaurants and countless Vietnamese restaurants but when I see a restaurant that specializes in more than one international cuisine I generally raise an eyebrow Never again If you have to avoid something here make it the crispy pork spring rollsI dont understand why this place is always so dead  I swear they have the most amazing curry pad thai ever Its SO good I would strongly recommend ordering the curry pad thai over the original pad thai This place is great the food is delicious the service is awesome and the interior is very clean I hope this place never closes down the pad thai is just too good LOL I do have to be honest and say I havent tried anything on the menu besides the calamari and pad thai though both of which are very good"

    "review":"Good slightly dated diner with allday breakfast The club sandwich was delicious and the breakfast food on other customers plates looked delicious too The staff are very friendly recognizing the locals by name and conversing while still managing the rest of the store As you can see from other photos they use frozen McCain crinkle cut fries which really ruins what could be a 4 star diner if they used freshcut friesLove their breakfast  I always get the big breakfast  a few slices of bacon a couple sausage links and a brazed slice of ham 3 overeasy eggs home fries THE BEST and toastReally cant say enough about the home fries  I know theres paprika in them but Id love to get their recipeSO AWESOME :Also love their banquet burger and fries  Hot beef and turkey sandwiches are great as wellThis is now my goto breakfast placeThis has to be one of the friendliest restaurants in the city Best servers hands downMy go to meal here has always the breakfast plate 2 eggs 2 sausagebacon 2 toast and hash browns This place has got to be one of the most consistent restaurants ever Its exactly the same every time and its delicious every time Mad props to the chefsFood arrives promptly and goes down easy Highly recommendedNote: This venue is cash only Also the bathroom is dirtyThis was mine and my wives first time here The waitress was fantastic and the food was awesome The prices were very inexpensive  Must tryI went here a couple of weeks ago and the service was absolutely horrible Food was good so we decided to give it another try this past weekend for a chance to redeem itself The service this time was even worse We waited 15 minutes just to get coffees and the lady still forgot our water The food also took about 25 minutes and we ordered eggs bacon and toast Thisnuse to be a regular spot for me but i cant stand the service Never will I be going here againgreat breakfast diner good prices good service"

    "review":"What can I say This is a very typical chain restaurant Sure you can enjoy a meal there but for the price you can probably find something better Their service is spotty I have been greeted by the owner of the place once but thats when the place is almost empty When it gets busy thats another story My soup which was supposed to come before my main course came after it Not only that the waitress tripped and spilled water all over the table Im not blaming her but they should really hire more people to accommodate the high seasons during school yearsNice dinner spotUn service excrable VraimentLa serveuse etait blase arrogante ennuyee de nous servir Le comble est lorsquon lui a demande de prendre une photo pour nous elle a sechement repondu Apres sans jamais revenir pour la photo cest quoi linteret davoir une photo avec des assiettes vides et sales  En revanche la manager etait beaucoup plus agreable Jaimerai beaucoup faire ca pour vousQuand a la nourriture cest pas top non plus La plupart des plats comprennent la soupe du jour une salade caesar ou garden0 et du pain a lail a volonteJai pris les spaghettis primavera pour les tomates sechees et le basilic indiques dans le menu et je aucun de ces elements netaient dans mon plat En revanche jai eu droit a une bonne dose dhuile du coup les pates etaient super grasses et beaucoup de poivrons Les legumes courgettes poivrons haricots plats etaient croquants voire pas crus ce qui nest pas forcement deplaisant mais je veux mes tomates sechees et mon basilic  Les pates netaient pas tres cuites non plusLe pain a lail est mauvais surtout quand on est familier avec la baguette francaise mais la salade etait tres bonne Je nai rien demande a la serveuse car honnetement si je peux eviter tout contact je le faisA eviter a tout prix a moins que vous fermez les yeux sur le service et profitez des entrees a volonte tout en emportant votre plat principal a la maison I havent been here in a while but it was average nothing special I went for an early lunch around 11:45ish so wasnt busy or noisy yet The hostess was nice and so was the waitress but it was hard to get the waitress attention when we needed her They have cheap lunch specials  not sure if thats unique to this location since its close to UW and WLU universities  with a lunchsize entree and side for 10I think that food is good nothing special though There are better places to get steak at the best thing here is 10 lunch dealNear UW and Wilfred Laurier theres a lot of things to eat but very little that actually has a sit down focus  Seeing how its all students running about to classes it makes sense  This East Side Mario is old when you compare it to other restaurants  Actually when you compare the restaurant to the froshes theyre practically the same age  Closest to UW and in the University plaza this ESM has stood at the prime location for a long time  I guess its feeding the students and its families when they come for a visit to the campus  Its old and worn and the service feels the same  Theres a lot of indifference  This particular location gets a lot of traffic  Youll have families of all ages and a lot of young frosh with their parents here  With ESM being a very common chain restaurant finding something you recognize is probably great for parents who travel 4 hours to visit their kids  Each time Ive been dragged here tally of 3 so far weve had to wait even with a reservation  It drives me nuts  The worst wait for 20 minutes even with a reservation  Once were seated you can feel the grime on the floor boards  The menu is the universal heavily sauced cheese laden and breaded American Italian  This place executes quickly on the mediocre dishes  Its one of the few things this place does well it moves dishes very fast  Lasagna grilled chicken salad and bread was dropped off at our tables within 10 minutes of ordering  The food tasted like it was just rewarmed in the oven from being in the freezer  Its no better than McCain at the local grocery store  As I mentioned the service is subpar  Perhaps its the cheap tipping by students or that its a really tough job with such a high turn over of tables but they really dont care  Refills are requested and forgotten  Forks are not given  Servers barely look at you and they mutter instead of speak clearly  Theres not budda boom budda bing to their step   Theres a lot of great eating places in Waterloo and this isnt one of them  If youre a student venture to any of the other restaurants at the plaza  The vegetarian and Taiwainese places are good starts  And if youre a parent visiting and shell shocked from having a kid in university drive out to King St north or south and youll find great options to feed your freshmen"

    "review":"I really like the food here The hand rolls are really good The dinner selection is good as well You should try their recommended popular dishes Especially the Big Hand Roll You also get a strange  but great  mix of All You Can Eat AYCE and table service This can be kind of odd at first but its nice to be able to ask the waitress questions and recommendations The only draw back so far is that they are very strict on time You have limited time to sit order and eat You cant over order or have left overs You cant go too late They really rush you Also they are super busy so you might not get your food right away or in the order you were seated This can cause you to over order and pay premiums for left over food For example we ordered just before last call and didnt get the majority of the food although the people seated after us that ordered the same dishes were already served we ended up over ordering They also glossed over this when I mentioned that we waited considerably longer Overall I would recommend it I would go back but dont go late and be wary of your time Youll also wait a long time to get inMy only complaint about this place is how close the tables are together As a girl with a booty I had to wait until the table next to me left and was cleared to escape for fear of knocking something off with my ass The service was great really quick to take your next order but not pushy and all of the sushi I had was great as wellCame at a busy time in the evening Has nice decorations around the one piece posters were a nice touchService was pretty good Servers were attentive However it was a bit annoying to have to submit orders through the server and not using a paper slip But I can understand why this was done One thing I may note our server would come up to us any time we glanced at the menu Hold you horses if were ready read our body language and social cuesOn to the food the tapas such as karaage or taro chips were wonderful and enjoyable However I didnt pay 30 for some awesome fried chicken and chips The sushi rolls were meh I really enjoy green dragon rolls but this one didnt make me want more I can only suspect it was the shrimp tempura as it had a funky flavour May be attributed to the oil it had been fried in The sashimi was not fresh Can definitely tell I can usually eat 15 pieces myself easily but I could barely eat 5 pieces Overall if it were a bit cheaper I may return However only for the tapas and not the sushi If I were able to buy a la carte I will returnGood sushi A little pricey at dinner but in general goodBest Sushi in KW Hands down Worth every single dime and you will be forking out a fair amount of dimes lemme tell yaThis place is so amazing  It is a la carte ordering and the service was fast and concise Every fish served was tasty and the mojitos were really good Its affordable and has nice decor Great for groups dates or casual lunch"

    "review":"Attended The Social a couple weeks ago and my mouth still drools when I think about the Truffle Risotto There was a coat checker when you walk in The renos inside the bar must have cost a fortune We sat at the unique bar for a couple drinks and small meals and we were very impressed all around CheersNice atmosphere friendly wait staff immaculate bathroom Food was nicely presented but is otherwise underwhelming Grilled octopus and chicken was over grilled and burnttastingWent here for dinner and drinks with a girlfriend on a Saturday night this winter LOVED it Our waiter and bartender Ryan made the whole experience We had 5 or 6 cocktails some of which we let them choose and had the charcuterie board and salads Food was awesome Place wasnt buy at all though Its in the bottom of he hotel but doesnt feel like it I just wish it was on the main level because in the summer I hate being indoors Went back again for brunch in a Saturday and place was empty again Different staff but food was still good Bathrooms are awesome I liked the decor overall modern but warm Long bar as wellWould probably recommend dinner moreCame on Monday night for their 5 mussel bowls and was not disappointed A classy restaurant thats great for a date night  not too crowded and the space is quite comfortable As for their daily deal they offer three flavor profiles not sure if its different on a weekly basis: white wine and garlic creamy coconut Thai and beer and bacon which sounds odd but definitely the best flavor While the portions arent huge counted 13 mussels in a bowl it was satisfying enough for me to get two portions My friends didnt feel the same and had to get more food afterwards but Id come back for their buck a shuck Thursdays"

    "review":"I was unfortunately very disappointed with the food I was super excited when the place opened on Lester but for what I paid for 1095 it was not worth it The box only had a handful of fries and 5 pieces of finger sized notsocrispyfish The box was  not even close to being HALF full Worst of all I was still hungry afterwardsI would like to give kudos to Jack for taking his business and customer feedback seriously Jack noted my feedback and reached out to invite me back to try their food again My second experience was much better than my first and I wasnt hungry this time 5 stars for conduct and 3 stars for foodFish dinner could be better There are other places I can get fresh never frozen fish and hand cut fries for 10 Customer service could also be better A friend and I went there for dinner We each had a Groupon voucher making separate purchases They would only let us use the one voucher Disappointing Not exactly begging us to come back againQuite pricey for the food You can get higher quality fish and chip meal for lower price at Mels Dinermost confusing fish and chips restaurant iv ever gone tofish batter was chewy and not crispy at allfish was covered in this weird popcorn style cheese dust seasoning their fish kipplings nuggets were marginally crispier but still chewy and cost 6 for 6 small ass pieces WTF chips are soggy too mind  blown how a restaurant can mess up fish and chips this badly also they forgot my coleslaw this place is gonna go broke just like the pizza place besides it if it doesnt improve its food soon smhI got the fish fillet meal to go The fish was bigger than I expected and pretty filling However the breading of the fish was chewy instead of crisp and flaky The fries were also pretty soggy definitely not the premium fries I am used to eating at McDonaldsI came here with the 5 Groupon deal they have it is definitely great value for 5 If 5 was their permanent price this review would be 4 or 5 stars However I do not see myself paying 9 for this meal"

    "review":"Coras is always pretty great but I particularly enjoyed this Coras I ordered the Buckwheat Mozza  Asparagus Crepe I am pretty sure and it was delicious hot tasty and fast arriving My com padres ordered a LOT of food too I love that it looks exactly as it does from the menu and I am not shocked when the bill comes Coras is like fine dining breakfast and to be honest that is pretty Unique Strawberry Wafflle is mad crazy The Tuna Melt Sandwich was massive and smelled amazing Few Issues here but please come fill my bottomless coffee please So I think the line for this restaurant is completely reasonable we always have to wait in line it is a good chance to chat The quality of the food is well worth waiting for At other Coras there are not very many children The menu is pretty adult But at Coras Waterloo there were SO MANY WILD KIDS at the table next to us there were 5 kids no parents all which were crawling under the table one was kneeling on the table and they were pretty much being the worst Oh yes and throwing seeds at each other The parents AKA Adults were sitting at a booth two booths down I think Coras should make a rule that the kids have to sit with the parents Otherwise there were some well behaved children in the restaurant I barely noticed Coras is great for everyone as it turns outPopular brunch breakfast in town Ive had breakfast at Coras several times in different locations Food is decent but nothing special and I always feel kinda greasy afterwards Maybe Im just spoiledService is friendly Usually theres a line up on weekends but it moves pretty fastI went to Coras last week for breakfast with my boyfriend It wasnt busy at all unlike the location I went to in London a few years ago We were seated right away and we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside and then in the sun or the shade and when we picked the shade they told us we could move tables if we got too coldThe food was good but not amazing We had the spinach omelette and the Western skillet Both were really good I was really surprised by the quality of the fresh fruit  I hadnt expected it to be bad but it was very nice and fresh Even if it doesnt say you get fruit on the menu you still get someThe service was amazing  very friendly and fast Probably the best service Ive had at a restaurant in as long as I can rememberI went to Coras twice in the past month The first time I ordered a strawberry crepe and second time I ordered a breakfast poutine Unlike most places what you see on the menu is exactly what you get served at Coras I was pleased with both meals The crepe had a bit too much fruits for my preference but still tasted great The poutine was pretty good as well My toast was slightly burnt though Overall I enjoyed the food and service here Nothing more nothing less Always a safe bet for breakfast  brunchThey have recently changed their menu style and the new menu is much more easier to read than before That is something that has made it easier for the eyesThankfully my friend made reservations for this place at 12:30pm on a Sunday and as such we could skip the line Otherwise the lineup is massive for this place and hence I would highly recommend people to make a reservation The orange juice was so fresh that it felt as though I was drinking juice directly from the orange than from anything else As for the menu whilst it is easy to read it is hard to decide You can genuinely pick anything on the menu and whatever you choose is going to taste really good The two reasons why I am not giving this place a full five stars are because of the super long lineups and the long wait time approximately 45mins until the food arrives Despite these two the food is still worth the waitWould definitely say that Coras is one of the best breakfast joints here in WaterlooFast and friendly service Ordered the Samira Wake Up with white toast Presentation was detailed and excellent Fruit was also almost all super fresh and sweet Great value for what you get a large plate of assorted fruit with 2 slices of toast for 13 had lots of left overs Only small complaint was the pear wasnt ripe or sweet Would definitely return and recommend"

    "review":"Im not sure Id call this place as the best Asian restaurant in Waterloo but its up there as far as value goes  While the portions are generous I have noticed that they have reduced them marginally over the decade or so weve been eating here  I tend to eat here almost once a week  Im not a fan of their pad thai  while large in quantity the flavor and seemed light on anything but noodle  Their vietnamese dishes on the other hand offer extraordinary value with pretty good flavor  Its pretty easy to order with somewhat blurry pictures on their menus associated with descriptions and anyone who has come here a few times pretty much knows their favorite dish by number  The most popular vietnamese dishes are broken down into components and combined at your leisure on a platter that include such things as pickled veggies spring rolls meat balls thin rice noodles or just some combination of meat and noodles in a soup also quite filling  You might want to check out some of their funky drinks Im not too much of a fan myself but a lot of friends are  My sister is a fan of their condensed milk  coffee though Im not a coffee drinker myself  Personally my standard is Fish Congee which is an acquired taste small or large 702 which I balance off with a side of fried spring rolls so as not to be too healthy  Whereas chinese spring rolls have a flakywafer type wrap these ones here seem like more of a batter and thicker shell  but Im a fan of them they also come included in a number of the vietnamese platters  Most recently yesterday the bill for the six of us was about 6070 including tip and we came away full but also with a doggy bag  Their dinner and lunch menus are the same so you can typically expect to pay about the same  about 10person including tip Oh and peanuts are everywhere so if you have a peanut allergy definitely stay away  The service ranges between mediocre and good  It can be tough to flag down someone to help you and they dont really time dishes so that they come out together  They bring them out as they are more or less ready  There are some dishes like Congee that take way longer than everything else probably because of volume so if you happen to know before hand you can tell the waitress to put the order in first while everyone figures out their orders and you might get it at the same time as everyone else   This restaurant gets busy though  While they dont take reservations you can call them to put yourself on the wait list during dinner or lunch  If youre trying to avoid the rush you should try to get there at or before 5 pm would probably be best  Id say that they get less busy after 8 pm but its otherwise always crazy busy there during peak timesTheir soups kind of inconsistent Sometimes its really flavourful sometimes its just subpar Going here beats driving all the way to kitchener though because pho dau bo and golden turtle arent significantly tastier anywayOrdered the Five Spice Beef Stew Tues night along with the calamari appetizer  The calamari lacked flavour but the texture was good and it was well cooked  I used spring roll dipping sauce as the wasabi mayo isnt my thing and it was quite delicious that way  They out did themselves with the 5 spice beef It was the best I have ever had there Really really good Service was fast and friendly and we made it to the movies on timeThis is a great restaurant for both lunch  dinner Their pho is delicious  is very generously proportioned I also recommend their rice dishes such as the curry  the rolls You should also try one of their desserts if you want an extra happy ending to your mealThe ambiance of the restaurant is also very nice with very polite waitresses However one of the times when I went for lunch there was an annoying fly that hung around my table :Its a little farther from Campus but when a friend could drive or if were at Conestoga mall we would drop by Ben Thanh  They make a good porkchop rice dish and also their mango or avocado smoothie is good too  people come here for pho too but the rice wins me over all the timeThis is one of my favorite places to eat in Waterloo While some say it might not be as authentic their food tastes solid and is one of the better places in Waterloo with decent pricesTheir Pad Thai Pad Siew are my go to noodle dishes I also recommend their Vietnamese spring rollsMy favorite dish for the summer is 304 the BBQ pork spring rolls sugar cane shrimp vermicelli bowl which offers a cool and light lunch for hot sticky summer days"

    "review":"Wings up is a very solid option for Wings in Waterloo they have a number of different flavours to choose from and different options for how they prepare the wings They do have other menu options but lets me honest who goes to a place called Wings Up and orders a wrap  The fries however are very good crispy potato wedges seasoned to perfection  My only complaint are the takeout containers  they use a very cheap cardboard container with printed graphics on the outside  It is kind of like wrapping your chicken wings in a freshly printed magazine the wings heat up the cardboard and soak into it leaving you with a cancerous smelling soggy box when you get home   Id recommend pouring the contents of the takeout box onto a plate as soon as possible  Another concern is the price a pound of wings and fries runs about 15  Which at a nice sitdown restaurant makes sense but at a takeout place It is hard to justify Other than that great wingsBest wings hands down  Prefer them over Wild Wings My go to place when Im in town Order was ready in less than 15min Staff was friendly and knew their stuff Brought friends and they all agreed  Try them You will love this placeI ate at Wings UP in Waterloo 6 days ago and the food was great but the place was disgustingly dirty Wash the windows and clean the floors  I wouldnt go back I have been to the Wings Up in Cambridge and it is cleanAre you looking for topquality takeout chicken wings that wont leave a hole in your wallet  Wings Up in Waterloo is the place to go  The selfdescribed Best Wings in the Galaxy does not disappoint with wings that are tasty and meaty with just the right amount of breading to soak up the sauce  My standard order of 2 lbs of wings came fresh and fast and I was on my way in a jiffy  My preference is for the honey garlic but my friends who love the heat go for the Sweatin Bullets  The next time you are looking for wings to go in Waterloo youll want to pay Wings Up a visit"

    "review":"Intimate little place in Belmont Village this restaurant is chronically busy  If you want a seat at lunch show up by noon reservations usually necessary for dinnerFresh and very delicious pasta for lunch definitely the best quality italian Ive had in the tricities area and I have tried quite a few places However more a  price point than a    I am looking forward to trying some of the other dishes and the desserts when I return for an evening meal sometime in the next monthIve had a number of good dinners here Its not terribly creative but if you want reliably tasty pasta dishes then Casa Rugantino is a good place to goAs soon as I saw the Peroni sign I knew I had to visit this place What a great find Really tasty Italian food with an authentic atmosphere I agree with the previous reviewers that the bread did not taste as great as the ones I tried in Italy but one cannot ask for too much in a town like WaterlooThis place is a bit pricy but the experience of enjoying a delicious plate of aubergine parmigiana on the patio on a warm spring day totally makes up for it I would surely visit this place againCasa Rugantino was greatI was really please with our dining experienceWe had a large group of 11 and they were a able to accommodate us we called a week before and b accommodated us well in their small space Nice work guysWe had a range of vegetarians to meateaters so we ordered: bruschetta an apperitivio cappellini carabonara spaghetti and meatballs steak tenderloin and some things in between Their wine selection was also great They sold us on dessert I definitely recommend the tartuffa raspberry is best The lemon sorbet looked amazing but alas I guess next timeThe good: solid experienceThe bad: the bread was ok kind of mehProtip: the oilvinegar bottle on the table is in fact for use Its pretty for sure but use it fool Gotta douse that bread in tastinessMy wife and I ate here recently  We both really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant While it is extremely small everything is freshly prepared  Our server was incredibly friendly and very attentive  My pizza was pretty good and my wifes cannelloni was fantastic  Our desserts were amazing tartufo for me cherry cheesecake for my wife Next time we are in the area Im sure well be returning  I Highly advise making a reservation as getting a table without one is near impossibleI had dinner at Casa Rugantino outside on a comfortable summer evening with a pleasant breeze which complimented the restaurant very well The ambience was classy tasteful and polite The waitresses were very friendly and welcoming Although I am no expert in Italian food it was the best Italian meal Ive ever had I ordered the special Lobster tail Fettucini which had a great Alfredo sauce flavor on it Great food decent price will visit again"

    "review":"Super friendly servers quick service Delicious food and all day breakfastThe breakfasts here are delicious but WAAAAAYYYY overpriced for breakfast food I understand that everything is made in house but that doesnt constitute gougingFuss free diner with great service Its my first time trying the Eggs Benedicts here and it really satisfied my cravingsOverpriced  We shared a breakfast that consisted of eggs meat potatoes and pancakes a large fruitcup and two coffees  28  Nothing specialI love Angies Its seriously as good as it gets in life I went there on day 1 of my amazing six day stay in Waterloo Angies was strongly recommended by the lovely hotel staff at the Delta Hotel who said Its my favourite breakfast place and its an institution around here A taxi driver said the same I loved it the food the people the ambience and I went back every day I tried lots of their dishes and Ive got good news about the foodBut first I must say that Ive never felt so at home in any restaurant or cafe or hotel anywhere ever And I happen to travel heaps and to great places Within 24 hours of being in town specifically after Sunday brunch at Angies I was hooked and happyAngies Diner was firmly at the centre of my extraordinary Waterloo experience Its the quintessential Canadian diner with heart Its been running since 1962 and has passed from Angie the daughter of Sicilian migrants to her feisty gorgeous daughter Teresa who at 65 or so is still running it with her gentle giant of a husband Bob They are assisted daily by their beautiful daughter Suzanne I do mean beautiful in every way all three of them and their staff At the bar are the six much loved original 1960s round stools in sparkly red wrapped by a wide band of chrome and set on a single black leg The glass cabinet at the front counter is full of unusual pies butter tarts and cinnamon buns All the lovely tables in blond wood or 1960s cream laminex have a sweet bunch of items on them The green plastic spiky plant fills a square shaped chrome box that sits so well with the red china bowl of strawberry jam sachets the bottle of golden maple syrup the little white bowl of sugar sachets and the 1960s salt and pepper shakersI liked the place and its offerings so much that I found it hard to choose where to sit and what to eat so I kept varying For just 1399 I was served the biggest breakfast I have ever seen the Country Style Breakfast and it actually included everything in the menu that had caught my eye the classic egg and bacon as well as ham sausage French Toast and pancakes with maple syrup It was great to get a taste of so many good things The French Toast was especially nice soft and crunchy with a lovely subtle flavourIt was when I commented on the delicious maple syrup that the wait staff brought the owner Teresa over to me Although she was busy she chatted lots with me and shes really interesting Over the days I met some of their other customers and this was fun This is a true family business and I loved watching the easy interactions of the family and the great service that they delivered One of my favourite meals was a specialty that Teresa recommended which was delicious spicy Jalapeno bacon served with best fried eggs ever rye toast and good Mennonite potatoes Another time the perfect eggs came with something new and interesting for me Krugs farmer sausageOn Suzannes advice I tried and loved the meat lovers omelette which included a mix of sausages ham bacon eggs and melted cheese Another morning I had hot oatmeal with brown sugar good comfort food And cappuccinoMy favourite meal was a lunch of grilled haddock fillets and golden fried chips that Teresa cooked for me herself She had just told Bob who came in every day for a meal that she would prepare the fish for him and turned to me recommending it I accepted It was so succulent fresh juicy and delicious I noticed that Bob often chose the soup of the day Next time Ill try it And apparently the pies are a must As an ItaloAustralian woman Waterloo is pretty far flung for me and in fact I cannot imagine choosing a winter holiday anywhere It was minus 16 degrees some days and snowing and yet to my surprise I loved it Trust me go Its going to sound crazy because I felt like I was God knows where at the North Pole or on the moon but I actually want to recommend Waterloo as a great travel destination For Angies for the fantastic live music scene at Dukes the pub next door and elsewhere in town for the Uni and the snow and most of all for the people Ive never been in a friendlier town  And how about this for special: the physicist Stephen Hawking works in Waterloo as does Bill Gates Wow Waterloo is the home of Blackberry and other successful start ups Googles Canadian office is right there and even Teresas brotherinlaw is a Nobel prize winner another physicist Waterloo is a mini Silicon Valley I think that the presence of very bright people in Waterloo must be linked to the amazing live music scene and to the general great character of the placeI say now to my fellow travellers start in Toronto at the cool Drakes hotel in amazing Queen St and then why not try Waterloo Stay at the beautiful Delta Hotel make Angies your home and cosy Diner and go to Dukes for great music til late What a trio in magical WaterlooIve been to Angies more times than I can count and have generally had good experiences My girlfriend and I would usually go on weekends when it gets crazy busy for breakfastbrunch This is definitely when they get the majority of their business because theyve drastically reducedeliminated their dinner hoursGenerally speaking the food is pretty good The toast that comes with the breakfast is made from freshly baked bread and it comes with a different kind of homemade jam every time On occasion the homefries have to be quite frank sucked but more often than not theyre decent I usually order either the Vegetarian or the Spanish omelette but am rarely full upon finishing it Thankfully my girlfriend usually doesnt finish all of her food so I take whatever she doesnt want When I think about why weve been there so many times I think its probably a combination of convenienceroutine and the fact that the place came to hold a bit of sentimental valueHere are a few random reflections on my many meals at Angies:1 The lineups suck You end up packed into the entrance with a bunch of hungover Laurier students while people are forced to squeeze by you on their way outto the bathroom There doesnt seem to be a good place to stand and it can be an annoying way to beginend your visit It is however a quintessential part of the Angies experience It doesnt seem to become an issue until about 11 amnoon so if you want to avoid the lines just go around 9 or 10 and you should be fine2 The service is inconsistent I think the staff are often overworked during the weekend breakfast rush and they often make mistakes Try to keep your order as simple as possible as extrasspecial instructions are often screwed up In the event that mistakes were made they have sometimes knocked a couple of bucks off the bill but it would be preferable for them to get the order right in the first place3 Upon ordering they will always ask if you want to start off with whatever baked good theyve recently made usually cinnamon buns I always dislike any attempt to upsell but this is more of a heads up than a complaint4 They often have groupons and lately theyve been giving out 3 gift certificates to use on a subsequent visit This basically amounts to free drinks since one of the conditions of the certificate is that you have to buy drinks"

    "review":"Just enjoyed the best shnitzel in the region The shnitzel is made in house fresh to order as was the spaetzel The service was excellent and I cant wait til our next visitHad a very tasty lunch here today I had the goulash and my wife had cabbage rolls  Nothing fancy  just tasty  real  home style cooking  Homemade almond cake for dessert was great  It is nice to eat food that didnt come out of the back of a Sysco truck this place is great: large portions and reasonable prices check it out and be sure order perogiesSimple homey and well done comfort food Terrific goulashSmall capacity but great service and really great schnitzel mash and roast sausage Quaint interiors also add to the fun Would definitely return Expect to spend 2030 for a meal and a beerGreat if you crave delicious schnitzel and perogies in a quaint setting  a house in Kitchener converted to a restaurant many years ago  No fuss just tasty food and big enough portions at decent prices  If youre a yuppie and value pampering and decor then go elsewhere  Just cash or debit  awesome fair for real people  My 18 year old daughter and 81 year old Mom on her birthday both gave it a thumbs up"

    "review":"Pepis has been a longtime favourite of mine since their pizzas are loaded with toppings  They make a great meat lovers or Canadian pizza but Im sure others are great as well  I understand theyre one of the original fast food locations in Kitchener and it shows  Unfortunately although the food is delicious the restaurant itself is in pretty rough shape Nevertheless their subs and wings are also delicious Some people find the pizza sauce sweet and overpowering which is a personal preference  To me this rates as one of the best pizzas in KitchenerWe are relatively new to Waterloo although weve been visiting for many years we have just moved into the area We decided on delivery tonight and had heard that Pepes was the king of pizza in town Well it is and it was worth it I ordered two large three toppings bacon mushroom and onion and wow did it come loaded When I picked up the two boxes from the delivery man I was shocked at the weight It is a lot of bang for the buck and the best part is the crust Crunchy cooked and delicious And unlike most pizzas not greasy I ordered two larges a mistake for three people and we didnt even start the second Oh well that will be lunch for the next day or two We will definitely be ordering from Pepes againand againI also heard great things about this place but was very disappointed  The crust was dry and thick sauce was tasteless and toppings look like they had been dumped on  Not only that but staff was rude and forgot our drinks  Wont be ordering from here againIm not a huge fan of the pizza it is great but the sauce is a little too much for me the next dayapparently the more authentic the pizza the worst heartburn I get :p their munchie dub is by far my fav    It was the late night dinner of choice for a long timeSecond time at Pepis and its even worse than the first  Ive sampled everything from frozen to the scissor cut slices of Rome and this is by far the worst pie Ive ever tasted  The crust is dry thin flat and flavourless   Not to say that thin crust is bad but this crust is so thin and crispy it rivals a an octogenarian Floridian The same goes for the sauce  On a positive note theyre fast and the toppings hefty  For a 18 medium 3 topping  pizza this just doesnt cut it thoughAlas a place that makes me want to eat next at Pizza PizzaWant pizza at 3am in this city  This place is open until 4am even on Sundays last I checked  The bacon topping and the cheeses they use are really good  Dont recommend the mushrooms tinned as a toppingMuch better than any franchise pizza in this cityThe pizza bases are really good too"

    "review":"Tried out this place on saturday and ordered the house special which came with beef flank and tripe The soup base tasted pretty good Yes it had a lot of msg but it was just as much as any of the other pho places and it really brought out the tasteI expected the large pho to be a little bigger but it was still an adequate amount for 8 They also only put in about 5 pieces of beef flank and some of it had a rainbow colour to it but it tasted fine My friends beef ball pho also looked really goodWorth a try if youre around campus as it is on par with other pho restaurantsTo be fair some of the rice combos are nice but cant be more chinese in a good away Didnt try phoService is probably the worst among all the restaurants around really rude waitressThe Kou Shui chicken taste very good Hope they can improve customer service little bitUsed to go here when before it changed hands and it was not bad  Have been here 2x since it changed names  Never again  Ordered large rare beef Pho 799   It came with wilted bean sprouts and dirty wilted basil  When I complained the rotten vegetables were taken back and they did find a piece of basil that was half fresh The Sriracha bottle was filthy with crusted left overs at the top  Staff was all too busy on their cell phones to have any kind of service Awful experienceThe food is pretty good and at a decent price with prices ranging from 715 depending on what you are getting Compared to the previous restaurant Golden Mango this place is a HUGE upgrade I love the fact that there are several options suitable to any test Decor is pretty simple but the only reason for the sortof low ratings is the notsogood service Always a struggle to flag down a waiterwaitress  it can be busy but sometimes theyll be on their phone and Ill have to come up to the register to ask whatever I need Overall come for the food Its pretty quick and filling But dont expect good serviceBased on all the previous reviews I decided I would give this place a shot To address all older reviews so far I have the following points to share:Servers seem to be cheery and nice so farFood took at least 25 minutes to show up in front of meFood prices are average leaner closer to the cheap sideThe description the restaurant gives itself appears rather off I wouldnt call this a Thai Vietnamese fusion restaurantIt may be odd to mention but the restaurant doesnt smell like a regular pho restaurant though thats probably more subjective than anythingIt appears that the staff can get orders confused I understand that this happens but theres only 5 occupied tablesI ordered spring rolls and a large order of their special phoThe spring rolls are only okay at best It was served with a sweet chilli Thai sauce and not with the fish sauce dip as I would expect Also some how the wrapping for the spring roll appears to be of a thicker and likely incorrect varietyThe pho is not pho Not even close to the right spices Not the variety of meat it describes be be in the soup they initially put in only rare beef pre cooked and then corrected it by add their own brisket No tripe and the other two items that elude me at the moment of writing Want pho Youll be disappointed At least I came here just wanting to try anything The only thing they really got right is the color of the soup unfortunately The noodles are slightly over done and has been sort of reduced to a sandy feel in the mouth Overall do not eat their pho Im not even sure what it was and although I feel like it tastes fine it does not taste like pho The broth is something rather random tasting and kinda even has a numbing effectIts very fortunate that I like the brisket replacement they gave me And the server was very nice She tried to defend the pho at first for its absence of the listed meats as being submerged but she saw my point and promptly changed it Even still this place has a long way to go It does fill a belly up but Im not sure if the person trying to eat may really like what heshe is filling hisher belly withIts unfortunate that this place decided to call itself phonomenon They should have called themselves something different because theres definitely nothing phonomenal about the pho here other than that it most definitely does not hold a chance against any other pho placeOne thing I do want to mention is that its okay to price food higher and serve the best of it It is not good to price something a little cheaper than other places and make it terrible It doesnt not do your dishes any justiceTo close: pho was bad spring rolls were borderline okay but the nice server helped me decide on 3 stars And yes I did finish my pho That is if you can even call that work of mouth numbingness as pho"

    "review":"The location is unassuming but inside the restaurant is comfortable  The food is okay with a range of prices  Service was attentive even though they were busyWe were in Kitchener and one of us who works near to Mediterraneo suggested we go for a quick bite The restaurant was not busy on a Saturday afternoon and we quickly seated The interior is nicely decorated and felt as if were in Greece The waitress was top notch in service I must add We ordered two Veg Moussakas one Greek Omlet and one Veg Fettuccine between the five of us The Moussakas come with a Greek Salad and a serving of Lentil Rice The veggies eggplants potatoes in tomato sauce is covered with bechamel sauce The veggies and sauce are delicious is the star of this dish The salad was great but normally we request that they go light on the dressing  which we didnt  and hence the dressing was a bit too much The rice perfectly cooked with lentils and onions but again too greasy for our taste The Fettuccine comes with veggies which was a welcome change and went perfectly with the noodles There is garlic bread and Parmesan cheese on the side again a welcome change as we dont like too much Parmesan Cheese The Greek Omlet is different and actually works well  rather than wrapped as served elsewhere here it is mixed and Omlet is actually a bit firm than the fluffy which I was used too A bit too much salt but I guess Feta Cheese did it Also comes with a pita bread  a welcome change rather than bread and Greek Salad We were thinking of trying the Mojito Cheese Cake but sadly they were out of it Perhaps next time  surely will visit the next time we are in KWThe service was fair not as slow as some have noted but certainly not speedy nor very attentive Just OK The meal was above average and was worthwhile enough to consider another trip The decorambiance is nice  unless you sit near the front door The foyer is not well built and you will hear a big THUNK every time someone entersleaves  Not sure how far away you need to be to avoid this but try to get seated as far away from the door as you canTwo words Lamb Stew Period If you are in Waterloo you should definitely checkout their tender Delicious lamb stew Its a classic family diner hence a lot of families and old folks The interior is very cozy and they even have a patio The food was excellent We ordered Crispy Calamari for appetizer and it was slightly dry but delicious May be the waitress had a bad day and she was not smiling or being nice Thats why I can not give 5 starsThe service is great and food was great  After a group of 6 of us enjoyed a meal we decided to get dessert  The desserts here are AMAZING  Highly recommended We would go back to this restaurant  Good prices and good service and good food  Its a hidden gem in a small plazaI ordered the lamb which was very good It was served with salad potatoes rice  vegetables Why only 3 stars  The service  the waitress maybe an off day for her did not ask me how I wanted my lamb  which came well done while I would have preferred it medium rare She also did not give me a steak knife I was left trying to cut it with a butter knife She never came back to check on me  by the time she came around to take another tables order I asked for a steak knife I was more then halfway done the lamb  its not like the place was packed From what I saw she was the only waitress working one other table just leaving as I got there  another table of 2 came in after meI do have to agree wit the previous review about the water being undrinkable Wish they use filtered water Food was good enough to go back for Maybe"

    "review":"The escargot and cheesy garlic bread are literally to die for Both are truly DELICIOUS  The hors doeuvres were veggie chips  very tasty and enjoyable  The wine was expensive at 12 for a 5 oz glass but it was tasty  I had the lobster with melted butter  Wonderful Well cooked delicious and a generous size  We also shared the 24 oz rib steak  I am not including that in tonights rating  It was a total disappointment as the chef lost his mind and cooked it medium to medium well and the outside was so charred it was brunt black and bitter  The veggies were hard and very undercooked the garlic mashed potatoes were lumpy and not tasty  We were not charged for the disastrous steak and the wait staff was so upset  We will give them a second chance to put their best foot forward another time  We were comped on desserts and given a coupon to encourage us to return and try them again which we will do  Service is more than 5  If we could give service a 10 we would  Management is super as well  Dcor is very nice pleasant quiet upscale  I definitely recommend to try them   I believe the steak problem was an unusual and isolated instance due to a sudden very heavy demand on the kitchen which resulted in our steak being forgotten on the grill  Crme brulee was delicious but be careful the brulee is a little thick and could cut your gums  The bon bons were a delightful touch at the end along with a small glass of sparkling champagne  All in all we enjoyed the night outI was going to update my review but on second thought  oh well  The lobster was a little chewy but that is to be expected from a frozen lobster I guess  The steak was cooked blue with a beating heart but that was okay as it got sent back for a couple more minutes on the grill and then it was fine  The so called saffron risotto was very very disappointing  Saffron  Hmmm  Gluggy rice and it was so cheesy the cheesy flavor overpowered literally everything else on the plate  Once again zucchini a bit of cauliflower and grilled sweet corn  Boring boring boring  Why sweet corn all the time when it isnt in season The flourless chocolate cake  skip it  Sort of like eating chocolate fudge but if you happen to like chocolate fudge  So we have tried the place twice and been disappointed there will not be a third try  Service is a 10  Appetizers are great  Come for the escargot garlic bread and crme brulee and you will be happyTried the restaurant from a Groupon and was more than impressed with the food and ambiance of this restaurant  The appetisers were fantastic and the steak was the best I have had in a long time  Highly recommended this location and strongly suggest you try itCame here during one of their promotional events where you can get an entree for only 20 If only this was the regular price all the time then Id come here more often They also advertised that if I liked their Facebook page Id get a 15 gift certificate for my next visit However its actually a 15 coupon off a minimum 50 purchase and one per table only Kind of disappointed in the way that they advertised it as a gift certificate FOOD:My friend and I ordered the 8oz New York Steak and the Ribs and Fries Both were delicious Personally I liked the the ribs a lot more than the steak They werent dry at all The steak was cooked exactly how I asked it to be recently for some reason the past few steakhouses I went to overcooked my steak but this was cooked well We also had the creme brulee and chocolate torte for dessert Both were really good but I highly recommend the creme brulee over the chocolate torte if you had to pick one  They also gave us some complimentary bon bons ice cream covered in chocolate which was really nice Also instead of bread they give you vegetable chips like kale chips Those were a bit too salty for me I think Id prefer getting breadSERVICE:Service was amazing However it might be because they were running a promotional event during the weekend I went It seems like the manager was walking around a lot and guiding a lot of the staff Everyone was super friendly and the waiterswaitresses frequently fill up your water whenever they see it is 23 empty or lowerATMOSPHERE:Really good date spot Pretty cozy and romantic :Overall great experienceThe atmosphere makes this place a really good date spot for special occasions since it is pricey However they do offer a groupon deal The service was really good and the manager kept coming by to make sure we were enjoying our meal The food was delicious Similar to the other yelp reviews I highly recommend the creme brle The steak was good but I would say its on par with other steak houses its good but not much better than the average steak house"

    "review":"This location of Yes opened up just before I moved away from the area My brother introduced me to it as he has been a fan for years having frequented the Waterloo location in years gone by I was fairly new to sushi and found the quality of food here above average The other bonus is that it is AYCEThe decor of the restaurant is very nice and the staff is prompt although sometimes orders are lost That is surprising considering you order by writing your selections on slips at the table They do have a large selection a favorite of which is spicy salmonYes was really missed after I moved away but I finally have a local AYCE that is 5 star quality both in the food quality and presentation Before that I would have rated Yes at 5 stars but now know that it is not quite up to par with my new local favorite Be that as it may I will be going back to Yes next time I am in the area as I have done many times beforeIts average If youre in the mood for sushi and are in the area its worth swinging by Sashimi  sliced a bit thin for my liking Tempura was okay MFried rice needed more flavour Maki and hand rolls were all good but nothing to write home about If youre a sushi fan youll be disappointed  its not great and not bad but given the ambiance itll leave you wanting If youre new to sushi itll be a good mealGreat sushi and service is quick as well  Our sales teams go to sushi spot in Cambridge usually for lunch but came for dinner this time  Get the crab pizza its prime timeWent in here for dinner tonight Its a nice looking place that offers only all you can eat options  I had a couple rolls and some sushi it was all good enough but nothing special  It felt like it was made quickly because of the all you can eat aspect Ive been to all you can eat places that took the time to make interesting rolls with a bit more flavor  I ordered a spicy tuna that had no spice to it and a dragon roll that I couldnt really identify the fish inOverall it was good for a quick dinner and the staff was friendly enoughFood was excellent  I am always amazed at how unfriendly and rude the servers are  Last night they were at their best  Not a smile or eye contact from a single one of them  We had a dirty glass with a hair in it  The server had to examine the glass at length  We ordered a dessert and literally had it thrown on our table  We did observe that tables on either side were surrounded by Asian customers they benefitted with much warmer gestures  Almost doesnt make you want to go back  No tips were left35 out of 5had lunch today with the wife and it was a good experience sushi was fresh and tempura items was nicely cooked however rice to fish ratio was not that great as it was more rice typical of ayce sushi the ipad menu was a nice touch service was fast i got my sushi and rolls in less than 5 minutes after order is finalized by the waitress same with the kitchen items weekend lunch was at 1499  bottomless po was at 160 45 with taxes and tips for two people"

    "review":"Once again just a simple pita joint But when they say they stuff your pita they really mean it Not much to say about this place except that you get exactly what you expectFood is pretty good especially anything chicken other than chicken soulvaki  its pretty dry Steak pita is quite good to  Most of the staff is great However the bosses are not overly friendly but Ive read that a lot They effect whether I want to go in or notFast generous portions fresh made to order with the ingredients you request I recommend getting it toasted All in all good value for your money A go to place for a pita near the University And a patio for those sunny daysSince the name of the place is Pita Factory I suggest getting a pita when you come here : The pitas are quite satisfying to eat when youre hungry as a fast food option but theyre definitely not the best representative of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern foodAlso I do not recommend getting their plates The components of the place ie the rice is very mediocre  its filling  since its not the best you dont feel the best afterwardsFor 625 you get their daily special pita and a drinkHowever after 5pm you can get a 5 pita from one of four choicesOverall good place to go to if you dont want to spend too muchIm a big fan of the Pita Factory chain Ive been to a few of their locations now and the food is always consistently fresh and delicious This location was very clean and well set up The staff was very friendly My lunch was really great"

    "review":"This place is hard to find but its worth the search The five spice pork belly bao I had was good a little bit too much fat But their ice cream sandwich on corn cookies is amazing The only down side is that their vanilla was not ready so I had to order chocolate swirl instead Ill come back for the vanilla soonDisappointing visit on Monday  We were two people and we each ordered a Bao plus a side of fries and 2 spring rolls  I ordered the Seuol Pork Bao and hated it  Probably my own fault as I asked for some Jeow hot sauce on the side and somebody I believe dumped a load of it into my Bao which mainly went uneaten   Worst thing they put both our sandwiches onto one plate  great so one of us has a plate and the other drips sauce all over herself and the table  As for the fries  large order but the price has gone up quite a bit on them  Mostly we received fries that were less than one inch long alot were just little bits and pieces what I think were the scrapings from the bottom of the barrel  Difficult to eat and no forks provided at all  We had to go up and request forks and even then had trouble digging the plastic forks into the hard little bits of fries  Our third visit there and well we were not impressed this time not at allGreat place to go in WaterlooThe food was unlike anything Ive ever tried in the area Those Baos certainly arent plain in flavour despite their simplistic appearance in picturesI would recommend the duck bao and surprisingly the friesThis place is a charm Perfect fusion between Vietnamese and Chinese So much better than I expected We had the chicken little and dusk dynasty bao with the duck poutine All are tastyThe employees are also very enthusiastic and helpful Only cons of this place is that its a little hard to find the entrance But all good nowNo pictures sadly because we are too eager for the food We will definitely come back againAs a relatively new addition to the Waterloo restaurant scene While it does sell speciality food it could become one of the hidden gems of the city I mean the entrance is pretty hard to find Located at in the northeast corner of balsam and larch streets the entrance is off larch tucked inside a parking lot for a few apartment complexesThe bao is very light and just sinks into your teeth The duck dynasty bao was full of flavour  the the crispy duck skin gives it a distinct texture and the hoisen mayo is a lot milder than reqgukar hoisen sauce an added bonus because it complements everything quite nicely The braised pork belly is very tender and overall very enjoyable The baos softness and light flavour encapsulates everything counteracting the heaviness of the ingredients Also if you want to spice things up a bit ask for their house made chilli sauce  you will not be disappointed The kimchi frites were good too but I found the beef a bit salty mixed in with the fries which tasted unseasoned helped minimize the saltiness The food was great but the highlight of the meal was the Thai Iced Tea This beautiful concoction made of black tea and condensed milk has a complicated but oddly satisfying flavour If youve ever had Hong Kongstyle milk tea it tastes similar but smoother creamier even Another thing I really liked about it is that its not iced its just chilled in the fridge which is great given how the ice will eventually melt and dilute the drink Overall I found it very satisfying Pricing is decent and you can also get a free drink for getting a baguette or 2 baos The only catch is the location  difficult to find but a great findIt was my first time going to Bao and it was definitely a place that I would come back to I had the duck dynasty baguette sandwich with the fries and a Thai iced tea Everything tasted so good and all the different flavours of the vegetables homemade sauce and meat went so well I definitely recommend this place although it was pretty tucked away"

    "review":"I love Chen Great food fair prices Excellent valueChens is a great place to grab a quick bite especially if you want something with flavour at a relatively decent student price In terms of atmosphere and seating its not really meant for a sit down style restaurant However the cleanliness is below average and especially when you see the kitchen through the front it doesnt look too clean Therefore your best option is take out Their best dish is probably the General Tsaos Chicken with white rice Its flavourful and quite authentic The quantity is large and so probably good enough for 15 meals Its what youd expect for a place that is located at a university plaza and you can expect something exceptional from here Their Crispy Beef is below par and disappointing Service in general is below average especially since not all the servers know EnglishFood is alright price is good for what you get  Chefs take forever to cook though so waaaaaay too long of a waitHow to describe this placegood for Waterloo I would say Out of all the restaurants in the University Plaza I would say Chens and Mikeys are the better Asian restaurants However that isnt really saying a lot My favourites are the rice with spicy chicken they also have spicy pork which is good too and the seasame chicken but Ive found the quality is really inconsistent Some days it seems like the food is delicious and super fresh other days I find it notsofresh I took my sister here when she came to visit and we got the rice with spicy chicken and the hot plate of beef and assorted vegetables  it was delicious I then made the mistake of taking my parents here a few weeks later and it wasdisappointing Ordered the Shanghai noodles with beef rice with spicy chicken and some stone bowl dish and it was not so good I will be coming back but only because it is super close to the school Word of advice: dont let the free bubble tea that comes with meals drag you in It tastes like luke warm water mixed with sugar essentially and is so not worthIve grabbed Chens multiple times since its close to DC library and to where I live Its convenient relatively fast they accept credit cards but their food is meh at best I usually get their beef ho fen which is usually okay but it is oily at times I also get their beef noodle soup which is not bad as well Compared to other plaza food options I would say Chens is the best bet for a fulfilling meal under 10 However I have heard from a lot of friends its not the cleanest of places and you could definitely tell as their kitchen is quite dirty and messyChens is my favourite place to go for dinner Their food is great and the price is very affordable I would highly recommend getting the Kung Pao Chicken combo on rice Service is great"

    "review":"The service is ok and the burgers are ok but the poutine is fantastic so I rate it 4 starsOkay service delicious burgers and friesThe line up was out the door when we arrived It took about 1015 minutes to receive our burgers and fries which isnt the greatest considering its supposed to be fast food  This is one of the only fast food places Ive ever seen that also has their liquor licence meaning you can enjoy a beer with your burgerThe bacon cheeseburger was delicious with plenty of toppings to choose from  The fries tasted fresh cut and were crisp  This location has one of the new Coca Cola machines that can create over 150 flavours of pop just to your likingI ordered a french fry and a peanut butter milkshake and both were delicious Would def returnBrought my 1113yr olds for supper Burgers were good buffalo chicken poutine was good but the thing my kids loved the most was the pop machine with all the unique flavors vanilla raspberry cherry and peach spriteNice burger joint Takes a bit to get the food but its fine if youre not in a rush Burgers are juicy and taste good price is okay Theres a decent burger selection available and it has an interesting coca cola machine for more flavour mixing funSlowest service ever No one else in the place and 20 minutes to cook a burger Then forgot our onion rings Not exactly fast food"

    "review":"Consistent quality something hard to find in the University plazaAuntys Kitchen is an affordable option for when you want to get your Indian addiction satisfiedThey also sell their dishes outside of this location I found some in the Math and Computers CD oncampusI absolutely love their butter chicken : and all of their other dishes It comes with rice and salad which makes for a pretty complete meal Also around certain times the line  the wait for the food is long However their food is a bit pricier than I would likeWe tried the Chilli chicken at the Food and Drink Show in Kitchener and it was great  In fact we both bought 2 helpings of it  Monday we were in the  city and since it is a Monday special we got two orders of chilli chicken  BIG disappointment  Huge  Mondays Chilli chicken was so loaded with sugar I worried about going into a diabetic coma   It was nothing like it was at the F  D Show  Not very spicy and way way too sweet to enjoy  All you could taste was sweet and the chicken pieces were to put it mildly tough and chewy what there was of them  Mostly it was onions and green peppers  The F  D version was alot spicier and NOT sweet like candy  Well I dont know what is going on but one after another it seems their recipes are changing and not for the better along with the portions shrinking  The rice lacks flavour and color and isnt tasty as it used to be the butter chicken is spicier than I want in a mild butter chicken dish now and the Nihari well I no longer wish to try it at all  The last time I tried Nihari I got a burnt throat from the spices and I eat very spicy food all the time although its mainly Asian rather than Pakistani  I deleted my last bad revue after the owner wrote in reply but this one will stand It just seems like things have changed here and the quality control is lacking Now there is nothing here that I want to eatThe food per dollar here is pretty good My only complaint is that the curry flavour in the buttered chicken is a bit lacking and its just spicy for the sake of being spicyI had the chicken shawarma plate wasnt the best shawarma Ive ever had but they give you a lot of food Im not sure what some other reviewers were talking about but the portion sizes are quite large mind you it did cost 12 bucksChicken was great although not very flavourful the fries were awesome and they also served it with a garden salad It was lacking the usual blend of pickled veggies and garlic sauce  hummus thats usually served with shawarma plates they did however give me a little dollop of garlic sauce If I go again Id probably try the wraps insteadIf you ask any student in the University Plaza they are most likely going to know Auntys Kitchen It serves great fusion Indian food with big portionsTheres not much of an ambience or seating area but I dont mind as I usually like to bring it home and eat such comfort food at the comfort of my own home Most things are over 10 but I usually cant finish it in one sitting so the price is very fairIm not too big of a fun of their fries but when it is covered in rich butter chicken sauce who can resist I love their raita that comes with their biryani rices too"
