    "review":"Looking for a spot to eat on my weekend adventure in Champaign  My crew of friends wanted to get a beer with our food and decided check out this place  Its a very spacious bar with tables along the walls  Like a fast food restaurant you order your food at the cash register which was located at the bar and then they call your number and you get your food  The food was pretty decent  I had a ham and swiss sandwich with Guinness mustard on a pretzel bun  I wish I would have ordered two of them it was so good  Based on the decor the  large number of TVs and serving drinks in plastic cups this is definitely a college sports bar  It seems like a fun bar to go to watch a game and see the Badgers winI mean Illini winGood burgers  buffalo chicken sandwich Had to order when you walked in and get your own food but very little wait Would definitely go again Looks like a fun bar at night tooAbsolute love this place I swear senior year there were weeks where we went probably 3 or 4 nights in a row Great for a chill night with friends but I especially like it during the day The happy hour deals on food are fantastic and the food is actually really good We also really enjoyed the outdoor seating area out back Oh by the way next time you are there order a Sex on the Beach They have their own special way of making itrealllly good and Ive never seen it done anywhere elseIm torn about Legends On one hand theyve got a pretty good selection of whiskeys for a Campustown bar I got Bulliet out of a very dusty looking bottle On the other hand the foods pretty weak Id rather eat a burger at Meatheads or Five Guys any day of the week Beer selection is okay thoughyou cannot beat the their Ride The Rail or School of Beer nights they are awesome When i went to school there i did them all the time and it was 2 dollars for a pint glass of anything on tap little dissapointed it goes up each time i visit kinda loosing the appeal of it Their food is actually pretty decent Not overly amazing but pretty good as far as bar food goes GO EARLY If you try to go on a ride the rail night and you get there late the line is insane and it takes forever to get a drink The worst is when its all beer specials and you have to wait for someone to get their Margaritta or fruity mixed drinks Come on its beer specials thats why everyone is here move out of the way this is def a day drinking barOn the one hand Legends is in my opinion the best campustownGreen Street bar On the other hand its still a college bar But its my favorite and thus 5 starsGreat atmosphere never overly crowded the way some of the other dumps on campus are often youre able to grab a seat even on some of the busiest nights My favorite night was Tuesday nights  Ride the Rail and yes I completed my rail card senior year Ive got my name up on the wall which is very cool but Ive got so many great memories of sitting around having beers with friends And I have to say the beer selections pretty good actually They always have a few good drafts on top of the normal college bar cheap watered down stuff Nothing elaborate but good quality mass produced stuff  Sam Adams Seasonals Woodchuck etcThe foods surprisingly good as well I would say Firehaus has better food but as far as green street bars go thats probably it I generally stuck with burgers or chicken sandwiches and they have a good selection of toppings to put on whatever food you getBut you really go to Legends for the atmosphere Its an upperclassman bar where you can go to actually hang out and talk with friends They have good music playing in the background but its never all that loud and its stuff you want to listen to anyway Theyve got some slot machines and pool tables now which also make for a good time and theres a dressed model of the Chief up front which is a welcome sight for any Illini"

    "review":"This location is a joke Puts an otherwise decent chain to shame They should have their franchise rights revoked Each time Ive been through the drivethru Ive had to wait to place my order wait to pay and then pull up to the waiting space and wait for my food They are out of things that are featured prominently on their menu They dont listen when you order Theyre always running behind yet seem to have a fair amount of people staffed Poor management I guess I visited earlier today and there was an ice chunk in my sandwich I imagine its from the produce being in the fridge but still gross pull your head out of your rear and pay attention to basic details Ive worked in fastfood i know lunches are busy i know there is always one less person than you want for the late night shift I get it to an extent But this location goes beyond the bounds of my already overly generous patience Do yourself a favor and go to meatheads or if youre strapped on cash hardees or taco bell or McDonalds or any other place within that half mile stretch on NeilI went to this location for the first time in a long time because a friend and I were hungry and it was real late  Kudos to any food establishment thats open 247 and they get a star for that in an of itself  our server was friendly enough although it was kind of a long wait to be seated  The place was packed with what I think was high school kids and they had like 2 people working the entire floor so I blame management on that  aside from the fries and shake the burger I got tasted like it had been in the microwave since vietnam after having the beef shipped from Somalia  It was a horrible sandwich and I felt sorry for the poor cow that had to give its life to be turned into whatever the hell they tried to serve me  Its sad because I remembered liking steak n shakes food  Maybe this was an off night for the cooksWaited 20 minutes apparently on fries All tables that came in after got their food first with fries But at least we got our bill yet again before our food At least 6 staff manager included just standing around Left without foodI will avoid this place at all costs but sometime its the only thing open late at nightThis place us worth coming to just for the shakes My favorite is the mocha shake The servers at night are overworked and the wait time for shakes can be long if you are in a big group That being said the shake us worth the waitI love the food and shakes The half price happy hour cannot be matched and the new breakfast options are decent as well Cant beat the prices and quality and being open 247 is convenientCheddar burger and the southwest burger are delicious and every kind of shake is greatHowever this location suffers from bad service and incompetent employees there is also a lock attached to one of the lights Still good enough for 4 stars"

    "review":"There is a long standing debate between my friends and I over the best Indian restaurant on Green street Unlike Chinese food here there isnt much competition so its basically Bombay vs East and West East and West is completely vegetarian and leans towards Southern Indian style snacks whereas Bombay Grill has heartier food  and has a more formal dinnerI think some of their dishes are a little overspiced but the Tandoori chicken is absolutely divine with a crisp skin and the perfect amount of seasoning I only wish it came with more chicken and less of the lentil side and gigantic naan Dont get me wrong the naan here is great but more of that chicken would be better The service is quite slow and it is pretty expensive so I reserve going here for when I really need a treatIve been to Bombay Indaian Grill a couple of times now and everything Ive had there was delicious Ive gotten the Bengan Bartha spicy eggplant and Aloo Gobi cauliflower with potatoes both of which were very tasty with a side of naan bread The only reason Im giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food is overpriced: 10 for a small cup of stewed vegetables and naan bread Pretty ridiculous if you ask meOverall I like the food there but because I dont like feeling ripped off I probably wont come back too often unless Im in the vicinity and have an extreme craving for Indian foodIve eaten at a lot of Indian places and I love Indian food I must say I was very pleased with this place especially given its location The food was delicious and pretty authentic I gave it four stars because the service was soso and there was no ice in the waterGenerous portions for lunch Wellseasoned and tasty Nothing fancy but very good and affordableSubpar Indian food which passes in town How is that there is no good Indian food in ChampaignUrbana There are so many amazing Korean and Chinese places The food here is generic and bland Not worth the moneyThe only reason this place is still in business is because nostalgic desi students will do anything to try to get a taste of home I know this because I am one of them I walked into this restaurant hoping to finally have some homestyle Indian soul food like the curries and masalas my mom makes I walked out with a severe case of food poisoning It took my stomach two days to recover from this fiasco This happened not once but twice the second time I went to this awful establishment was when my friend cajoled me into accompanying her for lunch and since it was her birthday I grudgingly accepted I decided to play it safe and get the mildest dish on the menu But to no avail just twenty minutes after I left the restaurant I was hit with another wave of food poisoning The only thing worse than the food here is the price both times I went I payed over 15 dollars basically to get food poisoning The taste of the food also is off the chicken I had there tasted old as if it had been sitting out for a while Gross The customer service is good and the people are polite but they are not nearly nice enough make up for the lamentable quality of food served This place doesnt even deserve to be called a restaurant it is a disgrace to the good name of restaurants everywhere"

    "review":"This is a Taco Bell alrightI used to eat here every Sunday for a while when I lived in the dorms and the kitchen  was closed  My standards were not terribly high but I was never disappointed with the soft tacos or nachosIve been back a few times lately  If you grew up eating Taco Bell sometimes the craving comes backOn this location:The side door area kind of smells like urine but it is right next to the bathroom  Ive never used the drive through so I cant commentGoing in the middle of the day on the weekend I have never had a problem  The food is Taco Bell  you know what you are getting  I am partial to the beefy crunch burrito right now  Its a burrito  With spicy Fritos on it  There are days when thats what you wantOne time I had a very disorganized order and the lady working the register organized it into value meals to save me some money  I really appreciated thatI usually get my food to go  Last time they forgot one of the tacos but when I mentioned it they immediately made it up for me  Then I took 12 Fire sauce packets as usual and left to enjoy itIve been here way too many times now and felt it was time to review  The service here is generally just okay  They often forget to give me my drink or Doritos but fix it without any hassle when asked  The food itself Ive never had an issue with always pretty good  Location is pretty convenient even more so now that the 22 Illini bus stops right out front Up until about a week ago they had a bunch of out of order tables broken tables but recently they installed new menus removed broken tables and removed the railing for the wait line so its looking a little better but the restaurant still isnt in that great of conditionAllinall for being cheap and reliably good food ill give it 3 starsIve been here a handful of times and dont have any negative feelings towards it though Im not blown away either After all it is a Taco BellThe staff is friendly and courteous in my experience but on occasion theyve forgotten items or gotten confused about orders Just check your bag before pulling away from the car line and all should be wellOn a side note Ive noticed the staff rather than hashing out Welcome to Taco Bell may I take your order asks Hello how are you first I find this bizarre but not bothersomeIve been going here for 2 years now Ive never had a problem with them Drive thru can be a bit slow but their chicken burrito grillers and quesadillas are hot and delicious so worth the wait Everyones very courteous and I can see them working hard to make the food in the kitchenStay away from this taco bell   You will often be waiting in the drive thru for over 20 minutes for a simple order One time I attempted to order but the drive thru speaker was broken so with cars behind me I attempted to pull forward and order in the window after waiting 10 minutes They informed me I could not get my order processed and would have to go inside After saying I already waited for 10 minutes the employee responded Man Im not the manager dont give me shit Rude dirty and low quality even for a taco bell  Go to the Taco bell on Neil St instead they are 35939395 times betterI have eaten at this specific Taco Bell many times before The service is excellent the staff are friendly and they have never messed up an order You can really tell that the employees here are not mad or rude like you often see at fast food joints and are simply pleased to serve their customersAs far as their drive thrus are concerned I have used their drive thru before and I havent had the lengthy wait times many have complained about but I guess I could have just gotten luckyOverall if you live in the CU area this is definitely one of the better Taco Bells to visit"

    "review":"This place is the dietary downfall of many students and ChampaignUrbana residents  I never had enough time during intermissions to properly savor the cakes eclairs pies and coffees so we would sometimes go even if we werent attending a performance  I dont think its even freshly made but the endless dessert possibilities will impressif youre near goodwin need to refuel dont feel like messing with green street etc then this is a good bet for lunch  i usually get the tuna salad sandwich  i give that 3 stars  but what should probably be noted is the 5 star rating on the carnegie cheesecake  the crust is really more of a sable cookie and the creaminess of the cake is unparalleled  its total museum food with a nice vibe from the crowd  if you sit along the north bank of windows which appear to be 50 feet high you can almost forget you are surrounded by cornfields  good place for meetings too cuz there are tons of tables  dinner before a performance is plausible as well if you are under time constraintsExcellent place for lunch I work across Krannert and this is convenient I love their veggie chiliThe food here is only okay but there is something utterly perfect about a campus lunchtime meal at the Intermezzo If youre a veggie go for the nachos andor veggie burger I also recommend you appreciate along with me the gruff style of the cashier UntouchableSome of the employees main chef and some of the order takers are rude  Forget about substitutions if you have allergies  The chef does not care Definitely not the place for people with ANY food considerations  Their emails say Intermezzo is open all year long but note that they are sometimes closed without warning  Make sure you get their emails and only go on days you get the email or call there first  Walking all the way there and finding them closed is annoying especially on short lunch days Check your order if you get it to go this is good for any place you go but especially here  Mistakes happen often Their tomato soup is like tasteless tomato water the grilled cheese that goes with it is almost equally tastelessThe coffee here Krannert Blend or whatever it is named is essentially university dining hall coffee All of it is self serve cappuccinos hot chocolate lattes all of it Not worth going here for a cup of coffee before or after a show at the Krannert What they do get right is pastry I got a carrot cake which was perfectly moist  carroty : This is not a cafe youd go in search of to studyworkchatit looks like it exists to serve snacks and beverages for people waiting for their show to begin"

    "review":"Great to have another solid and authentic Chinese restaurant in the area Prior to eating here I hadnt had traditional Chinese food in quite a while so it was very refreshing and much needed We came to Tang Dynasty mainly for the Peking duck although we ordered quite a few other dishes as well The Peking duck was pretty good definitely could have been a better skintomeat ratio There were lots of pieces of meat which is good but Peking duck is all about the skin I enjoyed the thin tortilla like pancakes served with the duck since its been so long since Ive had Peking duck with that as opposed to bao Other dishes I really enjoyed were the spicy Szechuan crispy tofu and the steamed fish The steamed fish was very traditional with the oily sauce and cilantro and hit close to home as I grew up eating that kind of fish in restaurants Among the dishes that were just okay and pretty standard fare were the beef chao men and salt and pepper beef with bell peppers At the end of the meal the red bean fried sesame balls were a nice touch Overall I had a very solid meal at Tang Dynasty and would definitely return when Im in the mood for traditional Chinese food in a nice settingIts a great Chinese restaurant with good service Menu is always updating and they just had a all new decI brought different friends to that restaurant several times recently All my friends are very impressed by the food there They have various kinds of food and all are really good Plus the owner of the restaurant is a super nice ladyIf this place were in Chicago Id give it a 35 star But since its in Champaign it automatically gets a boostOrdered the peking duck It was nice but the duck needed more flavor They dont give you enough of the white chives and cucumber as well as the wraps and poison sauce in proportion to the duck The duck was pretty fatty but that is just the nature of ducks However they could have scraped off the fat and cut the meats more uniformly You cant expect that level of detail in ChampaignUrbana though Skim was crispy The soup that came with my order of duck was pretty bad basically could have done without the soup Wish theyd serve a fried rice or something with the duck Also ordered the saut beef The beef was tender but I expect nothing less since most Chinese places do tenderize their meats But they did not give enough rice The rice came in this super small bowl Once again they did not think it through properly on how much rice needs to go with the dish Our server never came back to check on us and ask us how our food was Never refilled our water It was hard to get her attention when we needed something She was accommodating and nice but at the same time she was also the only one working there This restaurant was pretty empty for a Sunday dinnerThey also have hot pots here What I did not like was that their aquarium of live fish some of the fish were already dead This is pretty cruel All of their food need an extra kick in flavor Not bad a bit better than average but could be betterDinner for three last night We stuck to the authentic Chinese side of the menu and on the waiters recommendation ordered one dish for each of us: half duck no bones potatoeseggplantpeppers and spinach in garlic sauce The duck was good though the pancakes were cold The spinach was acceptable and looked like a popular dish considering how many other tables were ordering it But the best thing hands down was the eggplant dish which had the best sauce I think I have ever tasted You will like eggplant after trying this dish There was plenty of food for all of us and we even took some home afterward the vegetable dishes are large portions Price was totally reasonable Only real complaints are that the hot tea was barely warm and that we had to flag down our waiter to bring the check even though wed been sitting over empty plates for quite a whileFavourite Chinese restaurant in Chambana Ive tried hot pot and some other traditional Chinese food there Sometime the food is not so impressive but definitely above average Love the roasted duck here"

    "review":"I had not been here for several years  I wont be going back anytime soon  Way too expensive for what you get  My meal was 27 for a fillet they cook  The meat was fine the salad bar was empty there had been 3 buses  The place was filthy  The staff was beyond keeping up  8 for half a glass of wine  My bread was burnt my broccoli was cold and like eating a bush  It took an hour to get our meal  The waitress was absent  The popcorn was burntYIKESNot worth the money we paid the 2 to have our steaks cooked and they were not cooked the way we requested them Additionally the topping options got the baked potato was lacking Dont plan on visiting againFood was good We elected to cook our own and the only downfall of that was that I didnt have all my stuff to cook them up right I should have asked the barkeep for some bourbon but lesson learned The steak was really tasty regardless the spices or lack there of The beer I had was really tasty as well had Hale to the Chief IPA and the Eugene Porter both were good The porter went really well with the skillet cookie we got for desert Little more pricey then I thought at first But would come backand on the seventh day God rested and thought to himself  I am hungry for a steak So he made an old school steak house and he thought to himself  all is well with the world  Dont listen to the haters  This place has a patina to it  Enjoy it in this world of chain restaurantsOrder a steak cook it yourself and ask Eddie for advice on how to spice it  Eddie has been there longer than some customers are oldIf you like an old school steakhouse this is a must  This is on my top 10 for casual diningThese people giving bad reviews are missing the point This restaurant has been here for 30 years The whole concept behind it is cooking your own steak Its fun to stand around the grill have a drink and chat with friends while you cook thats the whole point If you dont want to do that then there are plenty of other steak restaurants in town to go to These complaints would be akin to going to a hibachi style steakhouse where they cook at the table and then complain that they are cooking too close to your table Alexanders is a good restaurant with highquality food and a fun concept if you dont want to cook yourself then its probably not the place to gowe had reservations and were seated quickly we ordered three appetizers each came so far apart that we finished with one before the next arrived I sat with an empty glass of tea for nearly 15 minutes at one point the kalamari was rubbery the onion rings were oily and the potato skins were tough  we waited another hour for our food 7:15 arrival nearly 9 when we got our food Ive been here 3 times this year after hearing for years how fabulous this place is the verdict overpriced for what you get you would get a better meal at texas roadouse for less money service worse every visit I dont plan on EVER returning there again"

    "review":"I am a fan of Chopstix delivery service Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd  My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup appetizer poultry fried rice etc The girl who picked up the phone was very nice I ordered the General Tsos Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced 905 A lot of the entrees are p riced between 89 which isnt too bad Its on the border of pricey however I dont mind paying this much from Chopstix They have a combo platter which I wouldnt recommend ordering The combo platter is priced between 7750 and is a smaller portion than the entree It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll The portion is too small and they dont give you enough meat in the combo platter In addition the egg roll isnt that great However my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner It was hot and fresh The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a 2 tip On the side note I just found out that they will charge a 150 delivery fee if your order is 1500 oh well Im excited that theyre open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future Anyways I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again Thank you roomie for this awesome recommendationChopstix definitely a drunk food classic but soberly I would pass The food is overpriced for the portions takes a long time to get delivered and tastes very subpar However the crab rangoon are the best in Champaign Theyre huge meaty and absolutely delicious  essentially the only reason why I would order from there anymoreI love this place   They give you an excellent amount of food for the money it tastes great and they deliver  Even lateMy go to when I want late night Chinese I usually get the lo mein or sesame chicken or tofu platter For about 89 you get a decent portion of entree fried or steamed rice and a spring or egg roll Their crab rangoons are folded more like a pocket but are still good little oniony though Delivery is fast and service is very good Not the BEST Chinese food in town but still good especially when everything else is closedA good place to go late night Try their curry fired rice and won ton hou Its very good Cant commet on other dishes thoughTry Ho Fun or Low Mein They are so good You can ask them to make your food spicy in level 15 Level 1 is perfect not too spicy but adds up more taste to the food Chopstix is perfect for dinner or late night if you do not feel like going out or low on budget At least all the food that Ive ordered has been good"

    "review":"I first visited Burrito King now merged with Torticas Grill based on a recommendation from a friend and I was not disappointed  The combo meals are a great value you can get a relatively authentic meal of two tacos rice and beans for 7 out the door or a bigger platter my choice was the burrito enchilada and tamale for just a little bit moreSure the value and authenticity are great but the one thing that will keep me coming back is the chorizo  The really smoky flavor is among the best that I have had  The chips and salsa possibly made onsite are also really solidAlright so they serve portentous portions at diner prices but the place is absolutely dirty The service is subpar as most of the tables arent clean by the time you get thereI have trouble admitting it but Torticas is probably my favorite place to eat in all of Champaign What I enjoy most there is the bang for your buck Never before have I gotten so much food for so little Not to mention the food is amazing Now granted I have a very very favorable disposition to Mexican food But theres just something so wonderful about getting a massive burrito covered in queso in a flimsy to go box accompanied with a small greasy brown bag of complimentary chips and salsa delivery Overall 55 This place is a hidden gem in my opinionBest Mexican food on campus I can honestly order anything on the menu and be happy Not to mention that their salsa and queso sauce are to die for My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week and weve never left unsatisfied The staff is always friendly and the food great I recommend the quesadillas  theyre smothered in their amazing queso sauceGave Burrito King a second chance after my very lackluster experience a few semesters ago and they definitely improvedWe came in at about 1:30 on Thursday for a belated Cinco de Mayoafter hitting the bars late night biteThey took our order and we waited about 10 minutes The ordering is kind of weird there isnt a counter or anything you just walk up to the cashier face to face and tell her your orderI got a pastor burrito and my girlfriend got a chicken quesadilla My burrito was pretty big the pastor tasted good and it also came with tomatoes sour cream and corn on the side It was also smothered in a cheese sauce which I didnt expect but added an unexpectedly good taste to the whole thing The pastor was tasty and seemed to be of decent quality Overall the burrito was surprisingly good The only complaint was that I added avocado to it for an upcharge and I think they used a guacamole spread instead not a big dealMy girlfriend said her chicken quesadilla was good tooOur meal was around 18 for two people it was a good amount of food for the price but it seems like the cost of all food is going up 7 is approaching Chipotle level pricesOverall a good experience here it seems like their late night options burritos tacos quesadillas are the way to go I would avoid the more entre type items availiable earlier in the dayIf you want a good burrito look elsewhere Pretty much anywhere else If you just want a burrito for the sake of having a burritoBurrito King is the place to go Very disappointed"

    "review":"Awesome food with amazing variety of indian cuisine It feels jus like havin lunch in a nice dhaba in India A humble suggestion for non indian patronskindly try to opt more for vegetarian options to have a more savory experience Dont miss on the Chaat samosa and gulab jamuns hereI ordered the vegetable and rice dish I asked for mild I really couldnt enjoy the dish because it was still way too spicy The portion size was good but the food was just OK Very few vegetarian choices on the buffet The staff wasnt very friendly Definitely didnt feel warm and inviting  Cant say Ill be back too many other places to tryGo between 3 and 5 and get the buffet for 8 which is really really cheap For indians  Have the goat curry in the buffet menu  If availableI didnt go home for Easter and didnt feel like cooking on a somewhat hungover Sunday afternoon Time for some Indian foodI had heard good things about Ambar and it was unsurprisingly open on Easter so we gave it a shotThe place is really small on the inside there were not many seats so we snagged a table for 2 after paying for our buffet I liked the place though it was pretty cute on the inside complete with authentic decorations and some catchy Indian radio stationI browsed the buffet and everything looked so mouthwatering I think I tried 95 of the stuff they had out there Im going to try and remember and spell the names correctly but forgive me if Im a little off The dishes that really stood out to me were the mutter paneer saag mushroom the spicy chicken 65 I think its called and the fried dough balls and spongey dessert thing sorry I have no idea what the proper name isOverall I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the food was Most of it was pretty fresh much tastier and even cheaper than the last buffet we went to Casablanca Out of the three Indian places Ive tried on or near campus I liked Ambar the best out of Sitara and CasablancaI love being able to get so many different cuisines on campus Indian food grows more and more on me every time I have itRecommended for sureI personally love this little place Good Indian food for a decent price The menu is very big and you get to choose a level of spice I work near Ambar and stop by a few times a month They are fast and it tastes deliciousThis is currently my favorite Indian restaurant in CU  I like their Palak Paneer better than my version I tend to prefer mine to Bombay and Sitara and really appreciate the ability to order online and specify spice levels I also enjoy the aloo tikki and plan on trying more dishes here"

    "review":"Health nuts and those looking for lighter fare will love that the food is free of heavy seasonings But the portions are tiny and my God is the service here slow and rude Perhaps thats why Sushi San despite occupying one of the most visible spots in the food court attracts hardly any customers even during peak hours Once I asked for rice and vegetables in separate containers as opposed to one on top of the other in a cramped bowl making it impossible to enjoy the two together The server flatout refused without even a trivial apologyThe Good:SO and I both ordered Unagi bowls The unagi itself was good and thats the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one The Bad:The veggies served with it were not great and it did not come with miso soup unlike all of their other bowls Also it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals around fifteentwenty minutes This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food Moreover he and I watched as the worker probably also the manager argued with a customer saying that she had already received her food when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item Overall would not return especially with Sushi Ichiban so close and with more reasonable prices"

    "review":"Ive eaten here on average of around eight times a year since 2007 Ive come to the conclusion that Radio Maria doesnt care about not being good because theyve established their niche in a town with so few good options allowing them to stay in business despite the downside Ive always had really good servers and bartenders here Some of the menu dishes can be really good but subject to inconsistent execution Some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard A vanilla cream sauce doesnt complement goat cheese for example It isnt interesting Its just kind of awfulWe came here for Sunday brunch and ordered 3 thingsLeroys buttermilk skillet cornbread  4  just one slice  Chicago downtowns Bandera Restaurant used to have a whole mini skillet for this price 5x the portion of this the price has since gone up  With the word skillet we assumed it would came in a full skillet even a small one but nope  Tastewise nothing to write home about the bread is just soso  Marmalade added a nice kick to it thoughMigas  Pulled Pork Eggs benedict  both were not too bad each came with a small side of their house potatoes  The deep fried house potatoes were delish Portions of the main entree were enough but the side potatoes was on the lighter side almost too little  Service at 1:30 pm on a Sunday was a little slow  the place was fairly filled up still it seemed like they had a good number of servers so this was a little disappointing  Nice ambient but can get very noisy  Our overall rating of the restaurant is 2starWe went to Radio Maria last night for dinner before seeing a show at the High Dive We ordered a few tapas and an entree to share We had the arancini the pork tacos the manchego and apple salad the maria torta and the black bean patty Most of the food was wonderful and I would definitely order it again however the black bean patty was inedible We were excited to try to because our friends had eaten it before and recommended it however there was absolutely no seasoning at all it was completely flavorless and I would not order it again The other downfall was the service our waitress was extremely unfriendly and acted like she did not want us there When we got to dessert my friend asked her about the gelatos of the day and she did not know what they were My friend decided to order them anyway The dessert took 20 minutes to come out and when the waitress brought it she literally set it down not explaining anything I would love to go back to enjoy the food and the atmosphere its a wonderful restaurant I just think that certain members of the waitstaff need a change in attitidueA great lunch and brunch place but Im less impressed by their dinner fareI mostly go here for brunch and the food rarely disappoints The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette scrambler and a sandwich The omelettes are only OK somehow they seem a bit dry and overcookedMy main complaint with brunch is the coffee For my past several visits its been quite weak and its hard to get a refill At a weekend brunch I do expect good hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup emptyFor dinner I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is A few years ago the menu had a much more pronounced CarribeanCubanSouth American flair to it and I miss that Im sure everything on the menu is very wellprepared but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of placesFor my last dinner experienced there I had a tenderloin special It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin one correctly medium one welldone six gnocchi I counted and a scattering of green peas I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent We did have a large party but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready no salads no bread I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriatelytrendy rectangular plate but the portions were quite small I shouldnt leave a restaurant after a 30 entree feeling a bit peckishI feel like Radio cant decide what it is A fancy drink bar A tapas bar A haute cuisine restaurant It does all those things fairly well but none of them exceptionallyA very interesting spot in downtown Champaign  A tapas bar beer bar brunch spot on the weekends cocktail bar and what else  I am probably missing somethingTables spread out up front  A blue lit bar and a spinning wheel of taps  Strange lighting and can get very loud later at night  Artsy and hip without being completely pretentious  Just a little thoughService can be a bit slow but always friendly and knowledgeable  Beer list is always rotating  Founders Dark Horse Ballast Point plenty of other US micros and a good selection of imports  I think the wheel has about 30 taps  Then a creative cocktail menu which I have yet to try  Outside of Blind Pig this was one of the first true beer bars in the areaFood is interesting  A mix of tapas other small plates and brunch  Hanger Steak is good as is the duck  Not everything is a hit but there is enough good stuff to keep you coming back  Like bone marrow pork shoulder and ricotta  This is definitely a place to check out downtown  An interesting mix of different bar and restaurant concepts  Good beer interesting and often very good food  Good spot"

    "review":"Right next to aroma cafe I heard this place has great baguettes and other breads for affordable prices I never got any though but it was on demand I like their smoothies I got the very berry blend which was great for the warm day but I would get the mango smoothies next time they didnt have it when I went They also have a Barry with cookies and other pastries The cookies are super cheap and taste fresh this would be my goto place only if I lived closer Dont get the iced coffee my friend got it and it tasted like airplane coffee loaded with ice cubes : if you want a nicer cup aroma cafe is right next door They have outdoor and indoor seating and breakfast and light lunch items on their menu too Definitely recommend this place for an early morning breakfast or evening tea :UPDATE: They have terrible omelettes I got a prosciuotto and provolone omelette which arrived late and was a stiff rubbery overlooked omelette stuffed with tiny chunks of ham  On the bright side I found out that they have Happy Hours from 36pm when you can get a coffee drink and two cookies for 3 and a few dollars off other drinksBreads are all very good The espresso is terribleIt was a lifesaver a number of times being close to the Blind Pig and when I am STARVING or if I want to improvise up a few appetizers for guests They have reasonably priced sandwich combos and I usually go for their italian meat option which often changes from month to month It is worth trying when you dont feel like something too heavy Guidos etc A sandwich is always a good complement to your beer tooI dont like the cakes but the bread is excellent at the level of any good german BeakereiIts sad I had a reasonably pleasant croissant two days ago and was very pleased with the quality of the baguettes I bought two and they were delicious HOWEVER The cappuccino was a piece of mess It was more close to a caffe latte It wasnt even a foamy latte Hardly any foam and then i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli yeah could not have been more disappointed I paid almost 5 bucks for a small cannoli and it was like paper soaked in water very heavy in texture Could not finish it But since the baguette was the reason I had gone there for the first place i give them two stars Want to try their opera and other sweet pastries but i will just order a doppio espresso No no cappuccinosGood quality food fairly priced What more could you ask Great place to stop in and have a bite Their bread is excellent"

    "review":"Perfect little place to sit and enjoy a drinkmeal  Great environment and service is good too  The food is quality and they have a very decent amount of drink optionsCome here all the time with my boyfriend I love the irish nachos beer battered sausages and the fish and chips the most Will always stop by when Im in champaignLOVE LOVE LOVE this place Im a bit of a sucker for Irish fare in general but the atmosphere here takes it a step further Small and intimate with dark woods and nice artistic accents Ive had just about everything on the menu and the only thing I was unimpressed with was the roasted chicken Definitely try the fishermans stew Its sooo goooood The corned beef and cabbage is amazing the shepherds pie is so savory and the bangers and mash are just wonderful They do a great snakebite too which down in Chambana is Guinness and cider not Guinness and HarpHad weekday lunch there twice Foods were basically similar though I ordered different dishes: once was the beef with sour cabbage with creamy sauce served with mashed potato the other time was a sandwich with the same beef and sour cabbage The flavor was good Not much meal choices thoughIll qualify this review by saying that 1 Ive only been here once and 2 I got the burger Im on a quest to find the best burgers CU has to offer The place is nice looking if a bit small and the staff was friendly enough The beer and cider selection is okay even if they hit you over the head with Guinness all the time I was expecting an Irish pub and the place is more upscale than that The burgers were okay if a bit dry but the cheese and bacon on them was overpowering It wasnt my favorite food in the world and Ive been in better pubs in other places That said I didnt go in to try the entrees and so your experiences may varyGreat cozy place for a well prepared meal  My favorite dishes are the potato pancakes Irish nachos fisherman stew and best of all  the short ribs Nice beer selection as well"

    "review":"I absolutely love The Bread Co We always get the classic cheese fondue or the beef fondue chefs selection cheese plate or the ricotta pizza The food is creative and cooked well and you get good portions which makes sense since it is pricey for a college town The ambiance is nice both inside and outside The only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is because when UIUC has any sort of event weekend Moms Weekend Dads Weekend etc they change the menus completely and have totally different printed ones and all my favorite stuff isnt available The waiterwaitress was always rude any time we tried to order ANYTHING even a little different from the special menuBread Company has been around for 15 years it is the kind of local place that visitors to town are likely to miss but its worth checking out especially for those who like to avoid chain restaurantsI recently stopped by for Sunday brunchsomething I almost skipped because their website didnt list a brunch menu I thought I knew most of the brunches in town and didnt know Bread Company was an option until todayThe service was friendly but like a lot of local restaurants the timing was notsogreat and generally felt inexperiencedThe waiter offered slowdrip pourover coffee but called the coffee blends when they were actually single varietals sorry coffee nerd here The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe though was aromatic and worth the extra charge though its reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on eitherI waited much too long to place my order after sitting and it was not busy  But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet which I added spinach to with no problem that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked The panfried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sourcreamewThe baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment Nice job Bread Company Great food Lacking final star only because my waiter could have used some some further training on the menu and service timingIt has been probably a decade since I have been to the bread company and today I found out why and have vowed I dont have to go backever A coworker and I went and the service was horrible nothing new here  read the other comments  it must be their thing price was absolutely atrocious for lunch and I ended up being sick all afternoon I ordered the ham sandwich and my friend ordered their special salad of the day Price was over 15 She got a diet coke I was offered a shot glass of water with no ice We get to the cashier and she refuses to listen to me as I try to tell her what our order was I asked the gentleman who took our order to put it on one ticket as it was my turn to pay and he didnt So she proceeds to ring me up and then not give us the drink So I tell her we need the diet coke She flips back through the register tape and says Oh I overcharged you a little Oh well Ill go get the drink NEVER offered me a refund or to make it correct Then gives me a picture to put on our table so she can bring us our items but then said Oh nevermind they are both ready So Im standing there with a drink my wallet and looking at two plates I said I cant carry all this she says You can take a tray and points to the cafeteria trays on the counter I opted to deliver my friends salad to her as she had secured us a table and drink and then came back for my sandwich I ordered a ham sandwich I got a turkey sandwich And then I got sickI will NEVER return I dont need to pay over fifteen dollars for a salad and drink and sandwich and be treated like shit only to then be sick all afternoonLovely experience here tonight Service was wonderful and was complimented by getting to meet the owner Lindsey She and her husband took it over from his family recently not exactly sure when to continue the family tradition Food was tasty  I had pesto pasta and husband had garlic pizza plus a French onion soup and bruschetta Atmosphere was quite nice on the patio and we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine that was reasonably priced We had the privilege of talking with Lindsay further and learning about their takeover after getting a summary from the menus which include an overview on key individuals in the history of Bread company including Lindsay and the original owner her mother in lawFood was pretty good Nice ambiance for dinners I got the hot turkey sandwich that came with some tasty potatoes in the side and a salad Was a little bit on the pricey side for a sandwich but I think that if you go during lunch youll get a better value for money My friend ended up getting a pasta dish which was pretty decent however like I mentioned it was pretty expensive Would be nice for a special occasionGood food Nice atmosphere and good for a date night Ordered the pepperoni pizza and it was tasty with lovely cheese and herbs on it My gf ordered a cheese fondue and she liked it Not too pricey for the up class atmosphere right next to camous"

    "review":"Ive heard a lot of good things about this place but found myself slightly underwhelmed by the food The guac was extremely salty however the queso was pretty good The portion size on the tacos were surprisingly small but the flavor was good Overall its not my first choiceBad Chipotle knockoff Im struggling to write this review without sounding whiny There is very little redeeming about this place One extra star for nice staff I guess The lettuce here is gross The chips are absurdly salty and Im a salt guy normally They upcharge for everything Bland guac with stingy scoop size Cold meats due to low turnover Grilled veggies werent even grilled Pico de Gallo had mealy tomatoes There is really no reason to go here Chipotle is a million times better and has the added bonus of their whole sustainability shtick Even if you work in the area theres a Moes literally a block away just go there instead I wouldnt return even with a couponIve never been to the existing location in Urbana so my only experiences have been with this new location  Entering the parking lot can be an interesting experience sometimes because cars leaving the lot have vision blocked on the left and the Starbucks drivethru is immediately inside the parking entranceI think the food is pretty decent quality  The burritos taste very fresh you get a good amount of fillings choice of meat choice of beans rice shredded cheese choice of salsa type  While some people dont like it I like the fact that they chop up the ingredients a bit before closing the burrito  The obvious competitors for this business are Moes Chipotle and Cactus Grill and sometimes in those burritos you get pockets of only rice or only beans The downside of Pancheros is that both queso and guacamole are upcharges 1 to get them in the burrito  Ive had several burritos from Pancheros without queso in the burrito and they are MUCH better if you get at least queso in themIf you compare them to their direct competitors they have similar pricing but the fact that EVERYTHING is an additional charge is disappointing  Cactus Grill and Chipotle both charge for guac and dont even have queso so Pancheros is up one on them   However Moes doesnt charge for guacamole and has better selection to choose from on ingredients and salsas which is a big plus in my book  I havent eaten in the restaurant but every time Im there the people behind the counter are friendly and the space looks pretty cleanOverall I like it and will likely continue to go thereI am not sure what the other reviewers ordered but for a quick burrito its a pretty good place The Queso is very good necessary sometimes as the meat can be a little bland However that being said I find the chicken and carnitas to be better than Chipotle or Moes The two major positives of Pancheros is that they fresh make your tortilla in front of you and they use little mixing utensils to combine all the contents of your burrito Each bite has everything compared to Chipotle where one side is rice and toppings and the other is Meat Overall a pretty good place for a reasonable priceits  Ive now eaten here 3 times since the chipotle scare of 2015 The food is good I get the bowl and tortilla on the side The fresh made tortilla is  on point I have to honestly share every time I come in the employees look pissed off and missable For example today the woman who served me looked like if I asked another question she would cut me with the meat spatula that she used to flip my tortilla good thing Im not vegetarianThe rice honestly sucks and most of the toppings are weak The corn is good though The meat this time was really dry  I only eat here out of shear continence but every time Im like why do I comeback if youre in the mood for fast causal burritoburrito bowl place drive the extra two miles and go to Chipotle on Green If you want good tacos go to Maize"

    "review":"I was walking around the mall Christmas shopping when I was struck with a sudden hunger  While walking around trying to decide where to eat a nice gentleman with a sample tray walked up to me and had me try one of every sample they hadAfter sampling the Orange chicken the teriyaki chicken and the bourbon chicken I decided to get a triple entree meal from KatosIt was delicious and they did not skimp on portion sizes like some places o it was mounded on my plate and was freshly madethe only complaint would be that the fried rice was rather bland and flavorlessIt was fine Id probably give it a 2 12 I had better hopes for something with the word Cajun in the title Hahahahanothing about it is cajun Its just another Aisan carryout of which there are several there in a row    I got the triple entree with side and drink for 8 The Katos chichen I had hopes of spice but it was nothing but over breaded mush and I think there was chicken in there The brocolli beef was mostly brocolli and the beef was dried out The noodles were nothing special I did enjoy the battered shrimp and appreciated that it was available as an option and not extra However if you wanted SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE to dunk it in a little 12 filled 2 oz cup IT WAS A QUARTER 27 with tax and there would have been a charge for it with the egg rolls or ragoonand the soda was dinky but thanks for not putting it on ice It was goodsized portions enough to bring home and finish later But probably never againI never had any kind of Asian or chines kind of food One Saturday we walked around in the mall and they gave out samples and I fell in love with Katos chicken and they gave you two big sides lots of food The food is reasonably pricedI too was served a toothpick with a hunk of chicken on it at the mall  I decided to order the bourbon chicken to go  The flavor of the chicken was really good  The price is average for what you get  I had the vegetables instead of the rice and they were good once you put some soy sauce on them  The chicken is hunks of chicken and not mutilated pieces like some of the other mall chicken on a stick placesI felt compelled to write an update on my latest visit  The chicken was awful It had a funny taste to it  I cant seem to put my finger on it  It did not taste like chicken nor did it look like chicken  I felt it was way overpriced for what I got  I will avoid from now onSummarizing my experience in one word:DeceptionToday I walked into the food court hungry after finishing some errands at the mall I met a manager waiting outside handing out samples of great tasting samples The lady at the counter also gave me some samples They were seducing Ill admit that I did get the three entre meal pepper chicken and the types they let me try The staff was attentive and filled me a side of soy sauce when I forgot to grab some since the bottles were not labeledThe food tasted great and filled me up It was great at firstAfter I was half way through I noticed that I had an unbearable salty taste in my mouth I was wondering if there was simply too much salt on my food I did not even finish the food completely I was feeling full when there was still riceI actually got measured and tried on suits at the clothes store nearby afterwards I felt  like my belly was sticking out the whole time I wanted to make sure such a sharp looking suit would fit nicely even though my abdomen was a little large than it should be Still I finished after an hour or so and returned homeWhen I got home I drank some water and did a few chores cleaning dishes laundry I drank some water again I realized that I was really thirsty and that my stomach still felt bloated I knew that there was something I was suspecting when I had my lunch I wondered if the food had MSG mixed in to it For those of you who dont know what MSG is look it up Sodium glutamate is safe naturally occurring nonessential amino acid Its like adding a type of salt and sugar to your food just to make it taste better Its a cheap unhealthy way to make customers believe that the food they are eating is awesome The problem that I have with MSG is that it makes me feel really bloated and I can tell my body has trouble fighting hard trying to clean it out I never want MSG mixed into my food and I may consider simply asking before hand whether it is an ingredient in the food at all Personally I find it irresponsible for a restaurant to use it simply for profit As a prospective businessman there are certain things that I will not tolerate being traded for short term profit Customer health and welfare is one of them Please stop using MSG or at least put signs stating clearly and truthfully whether you do or do not add MSG into your foods at any stage of preparation In case anyone disagrees with my views is why I explained clearly and transparently why I gave the two star rating I gave so you will have the opportunity to respond to this review or consider whether it is a valid rating"

    "review":"I would never order from this location again  they are very slow I have waited for more than an hour for my order to arrivewhen I call the store the only reason they have is that they have run in to complications and is out for delivery now not sure why it takes 80 min to deliver in a 2 mile radiusbad servicestay away if want your food delivered on timeIts a great place to order pizza in town at least for me They usually deliver the pizza very quickly during the week days but I dont know about the weekendsGreat price deals fast service and delivery accurate orders friendly drivers and an easy to use online ordering systemIm not happy about this pizza I ordered a large thin crust pizza with Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce Extra Cheese Italian Sausage Salami Feta Cheese Shredded Parmesan Extra Banana Peppers Mushrooms Onions The pizza had no feta cheese at all It certainly had no extra cheese or extra banana peppers The rest of the toppings were sparse with 4 pieces that had no toppings at all When I called to speak to the manager he said he weighed out the toppings I told him if that is what Dominos feels is an appropriate amount of toppings I wouldnt be ordering from there again He offered to remake the pizza but I didnt see the point if he was going to weigh out the same lame amount of toppingsand other than having him add some sprinkling of feta I didnt feel like waiting another 30 minutes for more disappointment no more Dominos for meI will add that the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the pizza was hot the driver was pleasant and the manager did offer to make another pizza and apologized for my dissatisfaction Obviously someone higher up decides how much gets weighed out on with toppingsGood service fast delivery hot food"

    "review":"grabbed breakfast here this morning and enjoyed the spinache artichoke souffle and a coffee  do not try to order a latte or other espresso drink because you will be disappointed  just opt for their house blend or their columbian  i like this panera better than the one at old farm shoppes because the clientelle seems a bit more diverse  free wifi is a plus too  yummy soups and salads but dont try to order any of the panini sandwiches without meattheyll tell you no  they are all premade and just waiting for the sandwich ironkind of makes you glad you werent allowed to order oneId give them a five for food but a 3 for customer service Our cashier was Kellie jo and she was so polite and warm and friendly She gets a 5 However as we were standing in line Robin was open at the cashier next to her and had no customers as she stood there and did not ask to help us while Kellie was busy with another customer When it was our turn to be waited on by kellie Robin then turned around and talked with another employee Other than that kellie needs a raise and i will come back if shes working The food however is always wonderful and makes my taste buds want moreThis national chain is going to save my life because it is probably one of the healthiest chains now available in most locales across America I had the kale salad with the French Onion Soup Yes maybe the soup is a little salty  but hey salt gives flavor The kale salad is new and has the name ingredient romaine parmesan some sort of little waferlike crouton and chicken They give a 12 lemon and simple olive oil for dressing Delicious Oh and get the unsweetened Acai Iced Tea Maybe they have new management maybe I was there on a good night maybe Im not that critical I dont know what the other reviewers are talking about service was friendly and professional and no Panera is quick duh its considered slow fast food just like 5Guys and some other relatively new chains you have to wait 510 minutes for your food because they make it to order When you expect that and you see they are especially busy I suppose 15 minutes could happen I dont know I had a good experience here and I enjoyed my meal It sure beats MacDonaldsCheersI never like panera and the only thing I got there is drinks cuz i have free gift cards7 dollars for half a sandwich is just not my thingHonestly  I am basing this locations rating from one experience  I have to It was just the greatest  Went through the drive thru fairly late in the evening because they are the only ones who stay open so late on a Sunday  It was probably 30ish minutes to close Ordered my usual pick two with soup and a 12 sandwich  When I got to the window the very kind gentleman at the window advised that they were unfortunately out of the Tomato Basil bread that usually comes on my sandwich and asked if I would like the white bread or something else  Their bread is always good so this is fine regardless  I really dont mind whatsoeverThe gentleman then hands me a receipt without my giving him my card to pay and he said this ones on us What You didnt have to do that Panera  I was more than happy to pay for my meal but they insisted because they didnt have any more of the normal bread for my sandwich Thats excellent service there That one act will keep me coming back over and over againThis is quite honestly the worst Panera I have ever been to in my life The customer service is beyond horrible all they do is roll their eyes as if the customer is an idiot for not knowing about the menu Honestly with how they treat customers the employee must be dreadful to have to manage and even work with I cant image going back here Even in the drive through they are beyond rude The only good experience I had was when Ashlee greeted me at the drive through window Every other employee I came in contact with was beyond rude Dont bother coming here Better off taking your business elsewhere"

    "review":"Some food are good however some food are out of the ordinary understanding of Chinese food The picture shows  we ordered It becomes deep fried intestine not  It is very crunchyThis place is a teeny bit closer to home than some of the other Chinese places in town so we gave it a shot based on reviews here saying the guy who used to own Tang Dynasty which means it should be the same guy who also owned Yen Ching many many years ago owns this placeThe lunch special is an entree egg drop or hot and sour soup and crab rangoon or eggroll  The price is pretty decent for all of that  except I didnt get any soup which I didnt discover until I got home and unpacked my togo order so I have no idea if its good or notThe entrees advertised as spicy were bland definitely no heat or spiceThe best part of any of our entrees was the crab rangoon  super creamy sweet flavorful  But unfortunately Im not going to suffer through mediocre food for excellent crab rangoon  There are far better Chinese places in town than this  Maybe it was just extra disappointing because I went into this thinking I was going to experience food like Yen Ching used to offer  but either way I simply wont be going backThe food is average compared to other Chinese restaurants in ChampaignUrbana area and they all have very good quality During busy time service is slowThis is clearly by far the best Chinese restaurant in Chambana I live in this town over forty years and have visited most large cities in the US  South China is as good as most Chinese restaurants that I have visitedThe food is excellent the ambient is conducive and parkings are ambleService was horrible it was my boyfriends graduation and we celebrated with 20 people we all waited for a while to finally put our orders in or to get drinks Then we had to wait over 30 min to finally have our food come Other tables came way after us with bigger groups as well but they received all of their food and we always had to keep asking the waitresses when our food was coming or for simple refills of drinks and rice Food is great but service sucked they should have better management on their staff since they were understaffed and the waitresses kept forgetting to give us our utensils and such and we always had to repeatedly remind them to serve us things properly Restaurant wasnt even that crowded but other Chinese people were served with lots of food and great service except for us We had a group of american and vietnamese people I dont recommend coming here unless you have a lot of patience for food to come over 30 min and that youre ChineseTop 2 Chinese in Champaign  The only downside is sometimes it gets slow for the ordered dish to come"

    "review":"I have been several times and cannot bring myself to return The service is so terrible that the entire experience is ruined Wait times for drinks can be up to 10 minutes when there are only 4 tables sat I have to send back glasses of wine every time because the bottle had been opened so long the glass was like vinegar Which took another 10 minutesI have even picked up my own stir fry from the counter after looking at my plate for several minutes The server seems to disappear to the kitchen which is crazy because the overwhelming majority of the food is cooked in the front of the house Waiting for a check to be brought and picked up can be up to 20 minutes after asking for itMy rating is not a reflection on the food which it quite good The service is just THAT badWhats not to love about 301 Mongolia  The lunch deal with unlimited bowls is all you can ask for  You pick your ingredients you season them with their sauces and flavor them with the seasoningsI love the Warrior sauce best spicy but not overly soI had dinner there a few weeks ago it was great the end result is typically your own fault since you create it yourself It was our first time dining at 301 mongolia  I must say I will return with friends The waiter Tk was fantastic She pin pointed every aspect She was attentive but not so much where it became annoying Even though it was pretty busy and looked as if she were the only one waiting tables  Our drinks were always on refill at the right time  although the buffet was 2 steps away she brang us extra sause upon request and was just a joy all around Two thumbs upWhen I lived in Bloomington I LOVED Flat Top  I havent really enjoyed the Flat Top in Champaign during my visits and decided to try 301 Mongolia  Love it  I really enjoy their salmon and crab when its available  Weve always had great service which is a huge plus  If youre new to the place try it at lunch when its cheaperDefinitely a lot better than flattop grill on campus  The quality of the meats are also an upgrade  The sauce choices make for an adventure  The lunch specials add value for those looking for a deal  The desserts are pretty good  make sure you try the chocolate filled wontons or the lemon ginger cheese cakeThe service can get slow sometimes this is the only negativeOne of my very favorite places to eat in Champaign  As others have said here the selection of fresh vegetables and protein are outstanding and grilled to perfection  Ive never had anything but excellent service but I tend to eat later than most folks and its never very busy when I go inI cant believe that several people have complained about the sauces being flavorless  They must have used just one sauce rather than mixing 3 or 4 to make their own custom sauce  I love curry so I start with that and add a little warrior to hot it up and then a ladle of whatever else Im in the mood for  Adding spices from the shakers at the end makes for even more customization  For desert if you like chocolate you absolutely must try the fried wontons filled with dark chocolate  Save room for them"

    "review":"This is a review on just their coffeeThe coffee is bad It has been burnt both times I have visited in the early mornings despite my hope that the first time was an isolated incident They sell the Seattles Best brand which I would imagine is not inherently bad coffee but something in their process is off as it is not good coffee in my book: too burned and too bitter for how disappointingly not strong it is Also the coffee only comes in small cups I wanted a 20 oz jar of rocket fuel but settled for 12 oz of undrinkable ashService was friendly and fairly fast I could not bear to give this less than 2 stars based upon only reviewing one menu item but if this was a coffeehouse serving this hot garbage it would be a one starI always get the meal with 2 sides and use my mailed coupon go out about once a month   for years now I get soupsalad burger and dark chocolate shake the food is fastfresh and I have never had a problem they have  accidently given me extra fries and did not chargethis place has been consistently good and fairly fast for the price it is great: Its not that this place is specifically bad I think Steak n Shake is just not my style The burgers are too floppy and sad and astoundingly greasy Shakes are so sweet it hurtsFirst the good news The food was tasty Every other part of the meal was a disaster My burger was missing everything but meat and cheese The cheese fries had no cheese and getting the attention of our server was nearly impossible We tried talking to the manager but he was too busy talking with his friends In all it took nearly an hour to feed two adults and three kids Most of it spent waiting This place could be good if the management got its act togetherIm leaving a 1star review only because Yelp wont let me go with 0stars  I also cannot leave a review for the food due to us picking up  leaving before we could get a food order in due to the lack of organization in this place  The table of 6 sitting next to us mentioned they had been waiting for close to an hour and 5 of the six were just about done with their food and one person was still waiting  We said forget it and went next door to Cracker Barrel and got seated  our food very quickly  It appears that the other reviews for this location are similar to what we experienced  Poor management poor attitudes and I can only imagine what goes on with the food preparation  Save your hard earned money and avoid this Steak n Shake at all costServer was good but the kitchen sucked 20 min for a chicken melt and a chilli Mac Last time I will go to this location"

    "review":"I started going to Cactus Grill as a student then continued to make it a regular lunch stop after I stayed in Champaign for a couple years following graduation Ive missed it ever since I moved away St Louis has plenty of great food including great Mexican but Ive never had anything quite like my regular order at Cactus GrillTheir Honey Grilled Chicken is delicious I get it on tacos with corn tortillas and all the toppings mild salsa for me Ive been gone so long I cant remember what day but on one day three of these tacos is their specialI was back in town yesterday for the day and had a full day of activity and eating but I still made it a point to stop by and grab one of these tacos on my way back out of town Wish I could get three more today Come to St Louis pleaseOrdered lunch from here and while the food is good I was not impressed with the customer service Ordered a taco salad made fajita style My taco salad was not fajita style nor did it have sour cream like I had ordered Ended up having to call and get a refund but according to Grubhub the refund can take 14 days to process and Im not wanting to have to deal with my bank for that long so I called and had the refund cancelled and asked if they could just deliver my food the way I had originally ordered it The woman from Grubhub said that was fine so the refund was cancelled Not 20 minutes later someone was at my door with cold onions and green peppers In a little container Not the food I ordered prepared the way I had ordered it but just the toppings Cold And still no sour cream Not impressed Wont be ordering againThe chicken tasted like some real chicken I was in and out fast and easy Its the off brand of Chipotle but the quality is better Great sized portion Will be back againI do love this place I like the options the specials and the prices I also like that its not a super chain like Pancheros or Chipotle The only down side is the lack of white meat chicken I dislike that its all dark meat Otherwise I love Cactus GrillOrdered the steak burrito bowl via a food delivery app because I had zero desire to get up off the couch Delivery was about an hour which is standard for the appordering system Came about ten minutes before the latest predicted time so that was nice Burrito bowl was delicious with LOTS of steak good amount of rice and the cilantro lime rice actually tasted like it had lime in it without being overwhelming I ordered the guacamole as well which was an awesome life choice Im a guac snob but it was flavorful without being overpowering Too much raw onion isnt fun for anyone even if you arent locking lips later on tonight : Portion was large enough that Ill probably finish it for lunch tomorrow AND it was a very reasonable price Props from this quasi Mexican food lover :Ordered for lunch at work yesterday and all of us agreed that for the price it was not worth it  it was just okay  Steak Chipotle Burrito was big but like most places they are made in such a way that you just get large pockets of one thing in each bite  Pancheros at least mixes theirs a bit  The steak was gray with a  nondiscript flavor but at least was chopped small enough that it didnt seem chewy  My spicy salsa was not apparent in the meal  The jalapeos were all lumped together in one of those aforementioned pocketsChips were okay tad greasy but good salt level Guac tasted like it was the prepackaged stuff you can buy in plastic bags in the produce section of the grocery store  it had that weird citric acid aftertaste that you dont get with fresh made guac  Did I still eat it  Yes I was hungry and I paid for it  Was I disappointed Yes I had heard good things about the place Live and Yelp I mean learn"

    "review":"Just like all the other ones Ive been to Great foodThis place gives you amazing food with a unique experience The food is like an Americanized Mongolian BBQ type of ordeal You start off with an empty bowl and chose whatever you want to go in your dish with your choice of meats vegetables noodles and sauces Then they have a big grill where someone cooks it for youThey always have great service here as well I am always pleased with the service I receive when I come here They dont have a big alcohol menu however the alcoholic beverages they do have are quite tasty And this is a great place for students to go and enjoy time out with their friends given that they do have a student discountI like this place Yes it is a chain that tries very hard to appear to be kitchy with handwritten signs etc and yes it is very easy to combine several ingredients that have no business being together making an unsurprisingly nastyass concoction That being said the ambiance is pretty good: lively enough to have a good time but still not too loud to hear your friends with decor nice enough to justify the prices I have always had good serviceWhat I like most about this place is that it is such a crowdpleaser vegetarians vegans those with food allergies gluten avoiders Atkins dieters idiots and those who are just plain picky for no other reason will all find plenty that suits themThis place is not without its quirks and if you are there for the first time DO NOT lie when the server asks you if you have ever dined with them Their systems are not perfectly intuitive at first glance so let the staff lay some knowledge on you But beware: like any buffet they will try to upsell you on pricey cocktails apps and whatever Get a drink if you must but stick to the buffetSo the prices atmosphere and  3star territory The excellent slightlygreasy flatbreads are 1 star and 1 star for the tons of different protein options the plethora of sauces and the many ways that everything can be customized via the lil plastic sticks Minus 1 star for expensive drinksPlease note that If you arent a college student then this place is NOT really expensiveFlat Top is a chain but it hasnt made it to Michigan yet darn  When Im in town for work I strong arm my local friends into coming here for lunch  We usually do the one trip because of time constraintsFT has a very nice selection of veggies and unique sauces  The protein choices are regular but fresh  Yes you pay a little extra if you want shrimp and then they only give you a skewer so stick with the chicken if youre cheapWhat sets FT apart from the Mongoliantype places in Michigan is that you choose how you want your final dish to turn out  in a hot and sour soup in a vegetable soup on top of a salad moo shu style or just regular stirfry in a bowl  Ive gotten the veggie soup my last couple of trips because I think the broth goes very well with the sauces I choose spicy hot and savory not sweet  And their flat bread is amazing  We always ask for extra extra extraAYCE breakfast for 999 yes please this is the first time ive had breakfast at flat top and i was pleasantly surprised lots of items to choose from you can get eggs scrambled or in an omelette theres pancakes french toast etc the options are endless service was alright our waitress was a little too chipper for a sunday morning which got on my nerves a bit but thats not her fault i was just trying to recover from a crazy saturday night PBreakfast here is usually hit or miss Today it was all the laterUndercooked pancakes and omelets were the norm I never received a  plate that was cooked well The potatoes were soggy with oil and I never received any bread despite requesting it every time  The wait staff was serviceable"

    "review":"Terrible service waited an hour and a half for cold food which came after people who have gotten there after us started leaving because theyd already gotten their food The waitress handed us food that was touching her shirt not to  mention that she was all sweaty By far the worst Mothers Day brunch weve ever had Would not recommend this place to anyoneI think this was the worst service Ive ever had I went out with a friend after a movie it was about 10 oclock we ordered and got our drinks service was slow Id finished my iced tea and when my food came the waitress said she was going to refill it threequarters of the way through my food about a halfhour later I finally get my iced tea my friend asked for more gravy and that took 20 minutes and we decided not to wait any longer they werent busy so there wasnt really any excuse the omelet that I got was small and overpriced my friend was so mad she didnt even wait for me she walked out the whole experience was just terrible and I definitely wont go backMy wife and I went to Perkins tonight around 7:45pm There were very few customers so I was hoping we would have good service Our drinks came out fast as did our food The food was good and hit the spot The problems came after we got our food Our waitress disappeared Im not sure if she was taking a break or busy doing other tasks but she was nowhere to be found We were wanting to order dessert which is one of the perks of going to Perkins as they have good pie and other goodies Unfortunately we have had this type of service in the past We did inform the manager about our disappearing waitressAnother problem I have with the staff is that if you order a muffin with your meal dont expect to get dessert The waiterwaitress will suggest that you probably dont want dessert since you had a muffin This has happened to us on multiple visits from multiple waitresses Im not sure if this is how they train their staff here but its really not a good way to run a business I want to give them my money for more food and tip well but they make it very difficult to do thisI dont care if you have the best food on the planet If your service is lousy then it ruins the whole experienceThey just dont know how to talk to these people service is absolutely horrible Food is not great but also expensive Theyre rude and avoid the cashier not sure whats up with himWent there again the other night Looking more and more rundown and the floor was filthyGreat hangover or late night food I could eat breakfast for every meal so I love all the omelettes pancakes bacon and hash browns The waitresses that have served us have put up with everyone very well"

    "review":"One of my favorite place The chili chicken is juicy fresh and tasty They also got great noodle soups Nice and cheap overall I even got dessert samples once and it was really good Unfortunately its not on the menu And I just wanna point out that they have free wifi you can go ahead and ask for the wifi passwordThe taste is really greatI tried house fried rice dan dan noodle crispy tofu and many other dishs here They have been all so tasty I dont think the price is expensive looking at the quality and and quantity In campus this is the place where they have the best noodle soupsGood food  Nothing fancy get your own drink silverware and you clean up after yourself  The food is very good and the portions are a good size  If you are looking for fancy linens and a snappy wait staff this is not your place  Normally very fastA business travelers perspective: The prices are alright but the food was really really greasy I got spring rolls that were dripping and crab rangoon that were somehow greasy and dry cardboardy at the same time No homemade sweet and sour sauce The wonton soup was decent a little light on flavor and the wontons fell apart instantly I also got mixed sauteed vegetables they were cooked nicely and you get a load of rice but the sauce is pretty heavy and salty Since I have to eat out when I travel obviously I ordered the sauteed vegtables thinking I could get something healthy to save for lunch when I wouldnt have time to go out for lunch the next day Nope Not great for eat in if you travel and have to eat out a lot since I have to go to a restaurant all the time I want to sit somewhere nice if I am going to stay in the place while I eat As a note I got takeout but that is a tip I always wish I had ahead of time regardlessIve heard lots of praise about this place but frankly I didnt care too much for Lai Lai Wok at all and I love Chinese food  The place seems to get pretty packed and there is not much room inside so I would expect a wait if you go during peak hours and want to eat in  The service was OK but the workers had a hard time speaking English so I didnt know if my order was being taken correctly and they had a really hard time explaining to me what certain dishes were  The food was ok  Nothing terribly wrong with it but I guess it did not just suit my fancy  I disliked the taste of the sauce used in the entrees  It had a very ketchuphot sauce type of taste to it  My parties entrees had similar sauces   Some people might like this type of sauce but I dislike it stronglyThe prices are good and you get a good sized portion of food  Its not a bad restaurant by any means I just dont prefer their recipes  I will be sticking with Golden HarborUPDATE:  Forgot to mention they DONT take credit cards A bit disappointing since we live in 2011I think this is my favorite ChineseTaiwanese eatery in Campustown I first thought it was a slower but higher quality and price restaurant but I was wrong in a good way First the food quality is indeed good I chose the Mongolian beef with broccoli and the chicken with snow peas The sauce was good not too thick or not too soupy and the broccoli was crisp and not too cooked The chicken with snow peas was really a pleasant treat as well The veggies rivaled the taste of the chicken always a good sign The food came out surprisingly quick and the price was almost as low as the lesser quality places nearby I regret I did not take advantage of Lai Lai Wok more often while I was in grad school The food was better but it is kind of far away from campus as well but I think the food is worth it for sure"

    "review":"Nice outside seating But seriously subway makes the worst chicken Im really not picky about what goes in my mouth but wow I almost threw away my chicken saladVery dirtytrash all over the floor on saturday 021415 about 12:00pm Fresh out of the oven bread placed next to the trashy floorOrdered a sandwich and the girl had to throw out the meat that was in the binit looked badwonder how long it was there Very difficult to place the order because of the constant banter between the 2 employeesHorrible place compared to other Subways in townI went to this location at prime brunch time They only had one worker who was openly talking to customers about how much her job sucked and she wanted to walk out It made people feel uncomfortable and no one felt sorry for her I got a breakfast sandwich and they had one egg left The sandwich wasnt good and i waited at least 20 minutes Overall VERY unsatisfied and will not returnI showed up here when they were supposed to open at 7AM for breakfast but they didnt open till 7:08 I asked for a toasted breakfast sub with Black Forest Ham American cheese their yellow Egg concoction about a week old usually onions cucumber and peppers I keep forgetting that subway American cheese is white I should have just gotten their cheddarThe toasting was poorly done and the customer service was pretty bad Needless to say Im not impressed in fact to help potential patrons: Id like to let you all know that the juices in store cost 149315 but you can get more variety juices from the vending machines for 125Im the President of Ditto Advertising and hardly ever leave a review but I stopped in after a meeting and Paul was very gracious to a very rude customer He later went to find her to see if she was satisfied with the outcome and she made a scene in front of the hundred passengers  Good job Paul for being the bigger person and representing Subway wellThis Subway is absolutely terrible  I like subway and its food in general but this branch is completely ruined by absolutely terrible service and quite possibly the worst employees Ive ever seen at a food establishmentNow Ive been here about 2025 times since its only a block away from my work and its one of the healthiest things to grab nearby and the same damn issues are present every single time  Ive now stopped going completely since I cant stand this branchFirst off they are always out of ingredients or bread  I usually get the chicken breast foot long sub  There had to be at least 10 occasions I went and they had no chicken breasts  Its also not uncommon for them to be out of bread and common ones too  No wheat no Italian  Theres been a few instances where all they had left was something obscure like Monterery Cheddar and this isnt some off hour  Its usually right during lunch   I can understand once or twice but you think they would take action to stop this from happening since it seems to happen ALL THE TIME  Anybody ever think to make more breadThey have been out of tomatoes out of peppers onions out of cucumbers Its ridiculous  The worst part is they act rude instead of apologetic  WE DONT HAVE THAT  ok no need to yell at me there Honestly though the worst part are the employees  Its been the same 4 people every time I go  The least worse of the bunch is the manager  She is an older lady and while generally nice there have been days where she has been outwardly disgruntled and talked to customers rudely looking as she was almost ready to snap but usually she is able to keep it shelled in The other employees sighTheres two younger girls who work there  They have never been rude but they work extremely lethargically  They often keep asking what you want and take a long time to put your sub together  They really need to pep up because they just act like its killing them to be there  Maybe it is killing them but you work a customer service job you got to perk upThe last employee that works there is a young male and he appalls me every single time with his actions  I really have no idea how he still has a job  His behavior is ridiculous He is probably and consistently the most disgruntled employee in the entire world He throws sandwiches together like they were no better than mush  He doesnt change his gloves often so I have had far too many sandwiches with buffalo chicken sauce oriental sauce etc etc on my sandwich Yea big no no  Thank god I dont have allergies but hot buffalo chicken sauce definitely does not taste any what appetizing smeared all over my cold cut eitherIt  doesnt stop there  He rants about his job to every single customer  No one even asks him yet he is constantly letting you know how badly his job sucks and how he cant handle it  Its like sheesh man we all worked crappy jobs at some point but that attitude sure isnt going to get you anywhere  Its not even something like a dreary Man Im having a rough day  Its more like a resentful God why do so many damn people have to come in I cant believe this shit AGHH KILLLLL MEEEE PLEASENo lie people that is what he does and that is why I get so bothered by it  In some ways he acts like so much of a trainwreck its almost amusing to watch his anger grow  Ive had my fair share of watching him throw stuff bang his head off a wall and even once scream F my life during the middle of making a sub after he dropped the bun on the floor  Still for as funny as it could be its just plain rude  He has made fun of customers several times and his constant whining gets on ones nerves way too easily  He acts like he is the only one with problems in his lifeAll and all I love the Subway chain in general but this branch has serious issues  The service is terrible and the staff is rude and downright horrendous with the way they act  I still love Subway but I will never go to this branch again"

    "review":"Recipes are one thing to roll out to a new location but goodnatured friendly service can sometimes be hard to get right Thankfully Mr Cochrane and his colleagues got both spot on at the new branch of their awardwinning barbeque joint Even if it is take out only for a few months it is worth a visit for anybody who appreciates good food and even better people Six starsThe bar is beautiful and looks like it has a ton of options Unfortunately that is all I say because my fianc and I sat at the bar for such a long time without being server that we left The hostess was polite Greeted us and sat us at the bar like we asked We looked over the menu which took longer than normal since we wanted to see what they had to offer Still none of the 3 people behind the bar acknowledge us There was only 1 other person sitting at the bar  Several tables but no enough to overwhelm the staff We got annoyed and started looking around Props to the hostess who came back approximately ten minutes after she sat us and asked if anyone had helped us yet We told her no and she went the the group of 3 people behind the bar with their backs turned and let them know They still did not come greet us right away We gave it another 60 seconds We were done We got up put our coats on and one of the people turned around started washing a piece of glassware and FINALLY said I will be right with you At that point we had waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged were standing up to leave and had our coats on I left hungry and disappointed  Place looks nice and the host cared about the customers at least Unfortunately we wont be giving that location a second chance soonJust tried new location on Sunday 1312016 unfortunately some of the same bad attitudes from the Urbana location came to Champaign First hostess kept looking for reasons not to accommodate us luckily a sweetheart of a hostess rescued us Then after being seated at the bar we couldnt get acknowledged for over 15 minutes When i waived to a  female with tatoos on her arm she proceeded to interrogate us about if the hostess sat us at the bar or did we seat ourselves This went around twice before a really nice male bartender waited on us Food was average burnt ends and pit beans Really dont need to return based on the overall treatmentI have been to the Urbana location multiple times and thought I would venture to the newer champaign one The wait was a little shorter because the place is larger but still had very little waiting room for the amount of peopleWe ordered the burnt ends appetizer which was delicious definitely meant for 23 people though The portion was pretty small I then had a pulled pork sandwich and the twice baked casserole on the side both are my usuals and I love them every time Things started slowing down around 1:30pm so if you are ever looking for a good lunch with no wait try to go around that timeSmoked catfish with Carolina BBQ cole slaw sweet potato fries and a Central Water Red Aledelicious The atmosphere was perfectly casual tooWe had a party of 12 including my twin 8 month old girls Weve been to the Urbana location many times but never with the twins or this many people We had a wait About 30 mins no biggie theres usually always a wait First off when we were seated the girl offered the high chairs that fit onto the table MAJOR PLUS IN THE MOM BOOK major props Mad Dog and put them on the table we got drinks apps and meals The waitress was awesome She def kept up the best she could with babies and so many people we were pretty needy Ive read a few reviews about the tip automatically being set to 18 and not being able to change it on the iPad hit CUSTOM lol We opted for 25 tip This place has amazing food Wings are the besttttttt Bleu cheese sauce is amazing Everyone including the babies loves the cornbread lol Hands down best BBQ around"

    "review":"I finally got to come in for flight night last Friday It was 15 for 3 glasses of wine At first I thought it was just going to be smaller pours but nope these were the real deal FULL pours of wine We also ordered the scotch egg which was AMAZING I think this is the best scotch egg Ive ever had and definitely the best one in town We also ordered a cheese board I meant to get the meat and cheese board but the girl asked me if I wanted the half size which I went with turns out the half size is just cheese Really great cheese though Lots of crazy things that I cant identifyone had fruit in it another one was all black and marbledGreat place to chill and hang out We also stopped in last Thursday for free wine tasting which they do from time to time and Metropolis was playing on tvso coolBar M is accessed through Pizza M Flying Machine Coffee Walk through the hallway with the restrooms and youll find yourself in a spacious modern bar The wine selection was interesting and there is enough variety to keep beer drinkers happy There are many tables to accommodate groups of all sizes and there is a lounge area with modern furnishings that can accommodate 6 people The space has a bit of an identity crisis the amount of tables and the bright lights makes it seem like a cafeteria but the graffiti that covers the wall make it really interesting and cool There are a lot of different light fixtures some are elegant while some are Ikea style paper lanterns that you may find in a dorm room Though the layout doesnt make sense to me it fits right in with the PizzaCoffee shop concept that I still dont quite get Its a nice addition to Urbana and I would return especially for the happy hour specials 57 pmThis is by far my favorite spot to hang out in Urbana Im SO happy that they opened in Urbana because even though Champaign isnt far from my house its really nice to have such a cool spot so close to home Im in the process of studying for a major board exam so I love coming to Bar M and getting a beer and studying in this environment in the early evening The atmosphere is super chill and comforting I love that they have the option of sitting at a table as well as the comfortable chairs The staff is seriously top notch Friendly knowledgable and they always remember me and my husband when we come in and ask how were doing Their decor is more in line with a cool Chicago spot than a bar in the middle of Urbana The beer is always fresh and they have realllllly good happy hour deals All in all I give them an AKateI like Bar M a lot They have trivia sometimes and Ive been to many events in the back A great space and an entry way into the alley if you want to chill outside or casually graze into Sip Yard Great wine and beer selection and they have awesome cheesessausage to try from I heard they make their own cured meats Either way from what Ive tried its been delicious along with their pizzas but thats the Pizza M side of the building I like the atmosphere and it can be a very cozy place to have some friends get together or to host an eventHonestly this place has some of the most INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES IVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IN MY LIFE First of all you should definitely call ahead to see if they have any wine or cheese available because BOTH WERE NOT IN STOCK WHEN WE WENT THERE How hard is it to stock wine when you are a WINE BAR THAT SERVES LESS THAN 20 WINES And the waiters could actually double as monkeys because they are incapable of taking an order correctly The waitress we dealt with had the audacity to say that a poster offering special deals that the bar had was JUST A POSTER Never in my life have I dealt with a bigger idiot All she did was lie false advertise and not have the proper ingredients to make a pizza By the way all they do is serve PIZZA Dont you think you would have cheese to make pizza Honestly some of the biggest idiots and sorry excuses for human beings I have ever dealt with This place needs to be shut down and no one should even remotely think about eating or celebrating anything here9 ounces of amazing wine for 12 Their wine flight was Italian tonight the same as their free wine tasting I got to choose my three favorite wines from the tasting and make a flight So cool The vibe at Bar M is chill Music is good too"

    "review":"Excellent Eggs Benedict and DD Breakfast Burrito Glad to see healthy alternatives for your traditional breakfastLets be clear part of the reason I marked this a half star lower than I would is that it is relatively more expensive That could be because of ingredient sourcing Now for the food: lovely glutenfree almond cherry cake thats just about sweet enough to compensate for the lack of flour for us folks with regular digestion and fresh flavorful balanced texture on that burger I wiped off the coleslaw too I plan to try the tacos and quinoa salad and the seitan Reuben next I have a feeling Ill be convinced to bump this up to 5 stars thenI like how calming and casual this place is And the food is great I got this one type of carrot juice that I think about oftenVery yummy and very friendly staff Have been there for dinner and Sunday brunch The chai snickerdoodle was huge and the best snickerdoodle Ive ever had vegan or otherwise It isnt cheap but it is yummy and fresh with a nice selectionSo amazing to have a vegan restaurant in Urbana Everything I have tried is delicious especially the sconesHad dinner here tonight and ordered The Tingler with kale beets lemon and ginger along with the vegan lasagna which came with a side salad  The juice lasagna and salad were all excellent  Portions seemed generous and fresh  We also ordered the German chocolate cake and the frosting was delicious but the cake itself was a little dry and had a sawdust texture  Otherwise it was decentOverall however this proved to be a better experience than my first time dining here when it was becoming very chilly this past winter and I ordered a tempeh wrap thinking it would be a hot sandwichonly to have it arrive cold  Not appetizing  I hope they continue to experiment some more and consider offering more rice or quinoa dishes that deviate from the expected spaghetti for example"

    "review":"Awesome place Great manners and REALLY fastCalled from marketplace mall area When i told the girl on the phone she said that I was serviced by a different location and that they were closed  Then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye  Wow No effort to satisfy a customer at allTurkey sandwich are great here and they make it super quickly  Its much better than subway although that is not saying much nowadaysI am from nevada so when it was raining of course I didnt want to leave my room So I ordered Jimmy Johns They are supposed to be really fast so I started a timer when I hung up from placing my order I am about a mile from the store and from the moment I hung up the phone until the moment the driver was at my door was 20 minutes A little slow but the sandwich was amazing I ordered a complicated sandwich and am very happy that it is all correct Bread tasted great and everything was freshThe delivery is fast and consistently good Online ordering is great Its annoying they dont give you napkins which is why no five star for me When Im home its not a big deal but sitting in my office it really takes away from the convenience factor and I get that I can ask them but 1 should I really have to and 2 even when Ive done that in the past they forget them I think its kind of a joke they dont give napkins by default honestly especially for delivery Having said that I still order from here all the time so why would they changeThis if my favorite JJs in town Staff always on top of their game I usually stop in on my way to work at least once With limited time before I have to clock in they normally have me in and out within 90 seconds I also live about a mile away Once I ordered for delivery on a 15 January afternoon Not only was my food at my house in 9 minutes but also delivered on a bicycle Thats some hardcore st right there Keep it up JJs"

    "review":"The first time I tried this place I was impressed with the great drinks and service The food is definitely over priced for what you get but since it says its all local that could explain why its expensive The second time I ate here wasawful Our server was a young guy who was either ignoring us or just super spacey we couldnt tell I ordered the exact same drink and it was completely different It tasted AWFUL They made me a new drink but still how could the same cocktail be made so differently each time The meal was fine but when we ordered the Texas Sheet cake for dessert we were disgusted How you can mess up a simple sheet cake is beyond me but they managed to do itIve been here several times and its one of my favorite places to go downtown Champaign Service is great even if they are busyReally fun place I recommend the tofu poboy sandwich the drinks really liked the Daisy Buchanan and the biscuits with jam Will definitely come back next time Im in townThe food tastes really really good They have fresh oysters Can you believe that Lol but their fried chicken came out black Thats why its a 4 starChicken here is stellar Wondeefully light and just the right salty goodness Watsons Wabbit craft cocktail was unusual featuring carrot juice and delicious Not to be missedGreat restaurant run by great people See you in May when Janelle and I visit from Florida"

    "review":"We came here for Saturday brunch and it was delicious Our server Trisha was fantastic My friend expected the fried egg BLT to be over hard when he brought it up she brought a new sandwich free of charge She was so polite and pleasant definitely a master of mixing mimosa flavors : I love coming here for brunch and would recommend the South of the Border HashI had the fish which was good but the relish was strange  It was different kinds of radishes   Small portions  The dessert  was greatYesterday my girlfriend and I had dinner at Big Grove First we had the french fries They were incredible We really loved the malt vinegar aioli Second she had the short rib and I had the mac and cheese Everything about the short rib dish was perfect I mean really everything tasted amazing The mac and cheese was just not as cheesy as I want out of my mac and cheese The bacon tasted good in the dish but I probably wouldnt get it again 5 stars for everything besides the mac and cheese 3 stars for the mac and cheeseThe best thing about this place is that everything on the menu is locally sourced from the veggies to the meats The bison burger is by far my favorite What makes it so great is you can taste the freshness of each of the ingredients in every dish Each option is carefully crafted to display the perfect balance or flavors The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggiesfruit which means there is always something new to try While the prices are a little bit higher than other sit down places it is definitely worth itThe locally available food here is great Weve had some of our favorite dishes here The only downside of having a variable menu based on only the freshest locally available ingredients is that sometimes the options arent that great and can feel over priced for the quality Also their beer is way overpriced but I guess thats okayI recommend checking the website to see what dishes they have available before you go They always have a rotating menu12315 UPDATECame in for a special night out with my boyfriend and ordered the Wheatberry Salad It just tasted like salty oranges I couldnt taste the delicate goat cheese that the menu advertised I dont even remember seeing citrus on the menu description They had this weird smear of white stuff on the plate which was decorated with some seasonings I couldnt tell if it was supposed to contribute flavor everything just tasted like salty oranges I am still standing by my 4 star rating and hoping that this was a fluke For their sake I hope these kinds of dishes dont make their appearance too often They could be doomed to be the next Jim Goulds  over priced terrible foodSo fun and trendy and industrial inside this place I knew the second I walked in that I would like this place Definitely my sceneStarted with their fried brussels sprouts also a trendy food item on top of the trendy decor theme with tuffle aioli and sea salt and nothing like a little sea salt to push a dish over These things were addicting I shared a little but not much Gotta love some good brussel sprouts I still dont get why kids hate these things so muchThen since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid I know yes they were fried but come on let me have my cake and it too okay I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese bacon leeks fried shallots and then as it should be topped with crumbled bread crumbs Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese Hot creamy cheesy goodness Done and done Plus they had a good beer selection here too the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service but pretty minor I definitely would come back here if I visited again"

    "review":"Food is mediocre at best but they have a decently priced lunch combo What makes this place a turnoff is the service I got lunch combos a few times and one time this server who never smiles clearly shorted me of food it was very obvious I complained to the cashier never smiles and she asked me if I want them to weigh the portions from now on Um no you never talk to a customer like that Never going backAs an American Born Chinese who grew up in Chicago tasting authentic Chinese food since as long as I can remember the food here is not the best but it satisfies my taste buds when Im away from home However the drinks here especially the slushes are terrible I tried the watermelon slush and it tasted awful They do not use real fruits at all and they are overloaded with sugar The watermelon slush tasted extremely artificial and it left a weird after taste that reminded me of medicineVery mediocre food but absolute rude attitudeWent once with bunch of friends and went upstairsWaiter silently threw down the menu and walked awayHas to call like 3 times for them to show up again to get the orderLunch portion is pretty though the selection sucks Fantastic bubble tea Ive had most of the over rice dishes again portions are solid and the quality is as good as anything else out there Service is lacklusterEvo The biggest fighting game tournament of the year No doesnt look like it Instead its a fast food Chinese joint I have to say that their lunch special isnt a special at all since the amount of food you get is equivalent to any other Chinese fast food joint at the same price However I will say that what makes them unique is that they do serve tofu and a scrambled eggtomato dish which Ive never seen before in the myriad fast food Chinese places Ive been to Its also neat that the water bottles are free tooMy friend and I were feeling adventurous one night and decided to order things we would not typically order from a Chinese restaurant  He ordered twice cooked pork and I ordered spicy schezuan fish  Now this was a bit on the expensive side 12 for my fish dish I think the other dish was 8 or 9 but it was totally worth it  Quantity wise that fish dish was my dinner that night as well as dinner the next day  Taste wise it was amazing  I wouldnt eat this every day since it is a bit heavy but this was good  Their bubble tea drinks are mediocre and it is a bit pricey overall which is why I give this place 3 stars instead of 5"

    "review":"They get a 4 star just off the buffalo chicken dpi and they are playing the pacquio fight Im a woman so I cant go higher than a 4 Even if the food is bomb A little difficult to find compared to others Set up is a little awkward I nearly walked past the hostess boothI just came out of this place and told that they have to improve the service They are not realising that how bad they are When I order draft beer got the bottle beer curly fries came out of the fridge The customer assistant was so rude and she cleared the food from our table even before we finish it without asking us When i asked why are you doing this and she replied that she has to go home This happened at 8:30pm We were really shocked by looking at the whole experience We will not return to this place and never recommend to our friends GrrThe most disgusting food I have ever been served in my life The grilled cheese sandwich was nothing more than two pieces of Texas Toast bread that had been smeared with butter and thrown in the microwave with two greasy slices of cheese in the middle The fries were cold and the service was less than desirable There were only about four other people in the entire restaurant and yet our waitress never bothered to give me a refillI didnt bother to leave a tipI dont recommend anyone go to the Champaign Hooters Instead go to Buffalo Wild Wings  WAAAAAY betterLOVE the wings here i think next to black dog they are the best in the city  The grilled chicken sandwich is excellent as well with a side of hot sauce and curley friesOnly drawback is the price they are pretty expensiveWow Dont know where to start so many bad things sayand so little timeLet us keep it simple Food really really bad Price oh my God them must be gold plated chickensmaybe thats why they taste so bad The service was ok not good just ok and my wife and I where the only customers at the time Save your money fire up the grill make your own I guarantee they will be better then what you would have spent way to much for at Hooters I rated the noise level as quiet because my wife and I didnt make much noise I gave it 4    just because it so overpricedThe combination of both beer and wings from hooters makes me sick in the morning I continue to eat there for years As always the servers fake like they care but that dont bother me as long as a get good service and I do Plus they are easy on the eyes"

    "review":"I loved Noodles and Company  I like the concept of everyone ordering their own choice of food with different combinations of meat  Service is fast they bring food to the table  Place is filled with students but not loud but then what do you expect in Urbana with University feeding all businesses in the areaThere were 5 in our group and we tried: Penne Rosa Pesto Cavatappi Indonesian Peanut Saute Pasta Fresca with Pork and Whole grain Tuscan Linguine  Except for Penne Rosa everything was very goodSmall bowl is perfect size for one adult  Regular can be sharedService is fast and food is filling  What more do you want at this price :It was a rainy day and I wanted to eat something spicy Considering we were on green street you will think we had many options Alas it was 9pm and half of the restaurants were closed Why Well I dont know why Guess God really wanted me to go to this restaurant and since Im a mere mortal I obliged to his wish I ordered pad Thai noodles with shrimps for my husband and Indonesian peanut saut for myself Food arrived pretty fast I liked peanut noodles but the pad Thai was too sweet for my taste I dont know how my husband finished it I mean it tastes nice if you just take 2 bites but the more you eat the more the sweetness starts coating your tongue But the taste was fine and since it was raining outside it felt nice to enjoy hot noodles Next time I will ask them to make it a bit spicy and less sweet if that is possibleI would give 0 star if I can Worst service ever Bad employee attitude Avoid here if you canI was excited to try this place on campus I got there at 6:30 and the dining room was a mess I obviously had just missed rush I ordered 3 items no meat and no drink and the bill was 15 When I questioned that I explained I had wanted the small bowl she hadnt ask and the side soup It came down to 10 I still felt that was pretty high She seemed extremely annoyed that I was bothering her with this and I kind of wanted to tell her honey if you dont like your job work someplace else The food was just okay At that price I would have liked enough to take home but the small portions were pretty measly and I finished it there Someone had dumped an entire order of macaroni and cheese in the middle of the floor and I got to stare at it while I ate At no point did anyone come clean it up while I was there I wont be going back anytime soonIt is okay if you are really hungry We ordered Japanese Pan Noodle It tasted a little bit sweet so we add spicy sauce I think I will try something else next timeSome coworkers wanted to go here for lunch and I agreed grudgingly  Id had it before when my company had a lunch catered but I didnt find anything I liked then  Today I tried the Japanese Pan Noodles with steak and it is easily the best thing Ive had from there before  Ive also tried the Pad Thai and the Steak Stroganoff but I didnt care for those choices very much   The noodles  a cookie no drink was 1150 so I thought it was pretty pricey for an order of noodles that were average at bestI rarely go on campus except when schools out  I can see why the students would like it though since its pretty fast  Id go again if others dragged me there but I think there are a lot better options both on and off campus"

    "review":"I first went to Bangkok Thai a couple weeks ago after finding it on complete accident and I was the only one in there at lunch time Its sad that theres no sign outside the building advertising it because Im sure if more students knew it was there they would go My favorites are the chicken fried rice and pad thai If you like spicy this is the place to goHonestly everytime Ive eaten from here something bad happens The first time I ate here i found a long black hair in the pho and wanted to throw up after seeing it The second time when I ate here i immediately had stomach pains which I feel is due to the fact that the food is DIRTY I really wanted to like this place but Im never eating here againSolid pad Thai Only had a level 3 on the spice level which was a decent kick but I really shouldve gone higher The lunchdinner specials are amazing If utilize those if I lived here Pretty cheap as well You serve yourself which is fine and you get to take a pitcher of water your table I wouldve liked nonstyrofoam cups but thats ok Solid food Solid pricesThis is probably my favorite restaurant on campus Im a big fan of spicy food which is why Thai Mexican and Indian are my favorite cuisines and as a college student having large portions of spicy food at a low price is a godsend They have 5 lunch specials the best ones being the Pad Kee Mao on Fridays and the Yellow Curry on Thursdays For vegetarians you can basically make any dish vegetarian by adding tofu instead of meat and the Oriental VegetablesTofu dish is fantastic While Ive had meh experiences with their pad kee mao the last two times Ive eaten here Im assuming its more of an aberration than a trendOnly been here once but the pad kee mao Friday special is amazing Very cheap too for dinner 6 Food is prepared fast so I really dont have any complaints so far Why only 4 stars Their Thai Tea comes in a bottle with powder residue Very disappointing I guess Im too used to seeing Thai Tea in a huge glass with the tea and milk still separated Ill be back but wont be getting Thai Tea again I overheard something about their Thai iced coffee so if thats not in a bottle too Ill try itI love the Pad Thai Quick service and happy employees I typically carry out but it is always filled with diners when Im there so you cant go wrong either way"

    "review":"Worst service I have ever received at a SubwayThis store is OK It has been remodeled since the last reviewers and is clean and modern looking now I tried the chipolte grilled chicken sandwich they have been advertising on the radio and it was bland It was not spicy and I had pepper jack cheese on it The chipolte sauce did not have any flavor at all I could taste the bread over everything else I do not recommend this sandwich unless you are looking for a bland flavorless sandwich I would like to add that the girls working the counter did a great job getting everyone through the line quickly Sometimes when you go to Subways the people working the counter think your there just to stand and look at the ingredients under the glassClean and Eugenia was very nice They were out of grilled chicken but there plenty of sandwiches to choose from No complaints from me No work trucks in parking lotI stooped in on my way home on a Mon night at 7 PM to pick up a sandwich The place was empty I ordered a tuna sub The nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad And mayonnaise And onions He said the manager hadnt ordered a supply truck for the week They will be out of those items until next week What kind of a manager is that I ordered a specialty a BMT I got it home and sat down to eat The sandwich was very tasteless unless you count the nasty bagged lettuce taste when you take a bite Why do restaurants use bagged lettuce when its so easy to cut head lettuce Shortcuts And if they take a shortcut with something that easy to prepare they take shortcuts on everything If I get a bagged taste at any restaurant its my last visitThis is the worst Subway in ChampaignUrbana Filthy and the staff was bitching about the fact that he had to sweep the floor Ill never be back too many other options in town and close to this location EwwwwwwwwThis Subway is the closest to my work so I go here when I want a quick sandwich  The last few times I have gone there have been big over sized work trucks parked in the parking lot  The lot at this location is way too small and its hard to maneuver around the vehicles  I parked in the very last spot so no one would block me in and sure enough one of those over sized work trucks parked next to me in a no parking area  I had to wait until he was done with his sandwich before I could leave  I will avoid this Subway until they get this problem resolved"

    "review":"My partners coworkers recommended Yori Q they sometimes go there for lunch We stopped by for an early Sunday dinner and were the first customers The decor is neutral edging toward the utilitarian Although weeds are growing outside the door inside the restaurant was clean Background music was playing the strains typical of coffeehouse alternative popThe waitress asked whether we preferred to be seated at the grill see below or at a table We chose a table The menu includes a range of appetizers some of which are fusion such as fried corn cakes chadol tostadas and kimchi fries Sadly for me the mandoo dumplings come as vegetable only but vegetarians might appreciate the optionWe found the appetizer fusion a fun concept its supposed to be Yori Qs central theme so we tried the chadol tostadas and kimchi fries The chadol tosadas came as 2 tostadas flat corn tortillas with a crunch topped mainly with onions shredded cabbage and a trace amount of sliced meat beef deckle or ribeye cap They tasted good but did not wow us The kimchi fries were underwhelming The waffle fries though plentiful and perfect for sharing were almost certainly from a freezer not prepared fresh on site They were not seasoned  not a grain of salt as far as we could tell They had two mayobased sauces squeezebottled onto them The kimchi covered only the very top of the pile of fries and even with a very small amount of freshly fried bacon cubes sprinkled over lacked in flavor The small waffle fry mountain was topped with a generous portion of finely shredded spring onionsOf course we also received banchan side dishes which are served before the meal in Korean bbq joints and often consist of housemade pickled things In this case the banchan were kimchi a sweet and sour cucumber and onion salad creambased coleslaw creambased macaroni salad with thinly sliced apples and celery and sliced fish cakes We found the banchan underwhelming too They did not taste especially housemade except for the cumcumber and onion salad just a hint more chili flavor than the standard Midwestern version The kimchi was too mild The coleslaw was not nearly as good as my mothers or mine It lacked acid and black pepper The macaroni salad was extremely bland the whitest of white food The sliced fish cakes were almost certainly commercialYoriQ offers a good range of entree styles from hot plates to rice bowls hot soups to cold noodles  even three fusion burgers bulgogi beef donkatsu pork and chicken My partner and I chose the dolsat bibimbap with bulgogi added my perennial favorite and our son had the bulgogi rice bowl I enjoyed the dolsat bibimbap which is a traditional nonfusion Korean dish of mixed vegetables steamed over rice with a fried egg on top served in a stone bowl dolsat heated so that the rice cooks in oil spread on the bottom until it becomes crisp and flavorful Yori Q used a plain vegetable oil rather than sesame oil as the base which is too bad a missed opportunity to produce authentic flavor The vegetables in bibimbap can vary slightly Here they were shredded carrots and daikon bracken fern kimchi mushrooms and zucchini I dont particularly care for bracken fern which basically tastes like slightly saline softcooked stems but it is authentic The other vegetables were delicious The egg was perfectly cooked too still soft enough for tender texture and sweet flavor my partner said it was the highlight of the dish The bulgogi was also tasty and tender but served in a very small portion two small bites tops A commercial gochujang is served in a squeeze bottle on the side traditional  this is a red chili paste that has a lowmedium heat profile and the texture of ketchup Also served on the side is a small dish of beef broth with scallions to pour over and moisten the dish the first time anywhere Ive received this with bibimbap  I dont know that it added much to the overall experience but it was fun to try something new with an old favorite Our sons bulgogi rice bowl was similar to the dolsat bibimbap only it included less vegetables by his design It did not include much more meat in the portion which disappointed him He loved the flavor of the bulgogi He did not find the rice had much flavor it made up the majority of the dishWould we go back I love Korean food my husband and son can take it or leave it Ill probably go elsewhere for my fix given other options in town Some other Yelpers have mentioned that Yori Q has high prices but 13 is about average for dolsat bibimbap and 7 isnt that bad for an appetizer at a nice restaurant There are more expensive options on the menu such as the 23 per person grill experience but that is all you can eat which seems reasonably priced One final note: We overheard a customer ordering the bubble tea which might make a fun addition to a mealEverything here is SO GOOD Came here for lunch on a Saturday with 5 other people  we got the corn jeon 2 sides of kimchi fries the bulgogi hot plate and the budae chigae hot plate to share and it was plenty of food for all of us Im not Korean but I love Korean food and this food tastes authentic to me All 5 of the people I came with are Korean and they love this place so that should tell you somethingA small but elegant restaurant I believe Corn Jeon Bulgogi plus Dolsot Bibimbap would be a fairly great meal for 23 people A little bit too much for 2 but not enough for 3 cuz it is so deliciousMaybe try dduk hot pot next timeId visited this place years ago before it was called Yori The downside is that it doesnt seem like the new owners have done anything to improve the physical restaraunt The upside is that the food doesnt seem to care and still decides to taste goodAs others have noted get the corn jeon even though its clearly a zillion calories  Im removing two stars because the area where we were seated was extremely cold drafty windows and maybe they were also keeping the heat low It was pretty uncomfortably cold  But Im adding a star back because the staff was very friendly and enthusiastic about serving us even though the place was empty and it was lateId like to go back and eat some moreSeverely overrated place Their sugarcoated corn pancake topped with green onions was the most confusing appetizer Id ever had Their side dishes lack variety and freshness chicken cutlet from their bentos was awfully hard and their dakbokkumtang was a disaster I tried here because my favorite teacher was a friend of the manager but sorry Im not going there again I get why people like it though a good place to start if you have zero tolerance for the authentic savory Korean flavor and all you need is an instagram photo of exotic foodnot sure if I shall try the 3rd time Ordered the beef hotpot 29 and ramen ricecake hotpot 16 add cheese 3 the second time The beef hotpot was ok but overly seasoned with soy sauce and sugar I remember I had to drinks tons of water afterwards Second time went for a cheaper choice bearing in mind that sometimes price does not justify quality However the ricecake hotpot was terribleexcessively spicy sweet and was undercooked ramen and ricecake shall be softer imoService was good and I heard many good words about this place Not sure if Ill try again Still wanna give a shot though"

    "review":"Love their subs Cheap and top shelf ingredientsTo be honest I have only eaten their sandwiches on 3 occasionsone time a friend surprised me and  brought a sandwichthe other two times were small promotional sandwiches delivered by wonderfulbubbly young ladiesbut alas even cuties dont make a bad sandwich taste good The bread was awful and there was massive amounts of mayoWelcome to Jimmy Johns the place where you can get a sandwich in your hand before youre done paying I probably come here once a week more or less and havent had any bad experiences Still a cornerstone of the student diet and great for a quick meal Is it a little bit overpriced for cold cuts veggies and bread Probably But when youre in between classes or rushing to catch a bus somewhere it matters and besides you probably wont find much better for a 6 meal anyways The bread tastes great the lettuce is always crisp and the balance between the meat toppings and mayonnaise is always spotonPolitically JJs is absolutely the worst But the subs OH the subs That said for some reason this is the worst Jimmy Johns in CU Not sure why but its never as satisfying as other ones I highly recommend the one on Lincoln thoughI do love you Jimmy Johns but when you tell me that I have to pay for a water glass after 10pm to go with my sandwich that is a joke  The cashier laughed as asked for a water glass and he said it would be 150  Are you serious  There are other more worthy late night places than this locationI definitely like Jimmy Johns Its my favorite place to pick up a snack in between classes I like simple sandwiches and Jimmy John does some great cheap simple sandwiches  Their slims no veggies or sauce on the menu are only 325 plus I can pick up a 14 piece of day old bread for like 050 and Ive got myself a full meal for like 4 I cant complain about thatThe staff have always been really friendly  I think theyre forced to sort of yell Hello and Catch you later as you enter and leave the shop  But they sound sincere enough so Ill say thats a good thing for them to do  But no complaints here However I cant really complain about nothing and give it 4 stars so:  Analyzing their pricing a little more carefully I discovered that for 075 more you can go over to subway when theyre doing the 5 footlongs and get like 34 more inches of sandwich for 75 cents more  I did some calculating:  Youd save 12 cents an inch of sandwich by doing this  Over your college career thatd be approximately 240 assuming an average consumption of 2 sandwichesweek for 4 school years  Just some food for thought  Luckily Jimmy Johns gives me a 1 off for not getting veggies which brings me to about 1 centinch cheaper than subway so I dont have to make that decision"

    "review":"Im so happy that Xinh Xinh finally opened Ive gone twice now and both times I loved everything I tried The pho is the best in CU in my opinion cuz it tastes the way authentic pho should The broth is very flavorful and tastes like time and care was put into its preparation The veggies that come with the pho looked nice and fresh The plum soda tastes just like it does back homesalty and sweet just the way I like it Its definitely an acquired taste though The almond boba I tried was also delish and refreshing The rice paper wrapped spring rolls the fried version were very tasty and I loved being able to wrap them in the lettuce and mint leaves The rolls looked skinny but they were actually quite fillingyou get 4 I also tried the fresh spring rolls not fried and those were huge The fried wontons inside were a delightful surprise and the whole thing tasted so good The meat is definitely flavored well You get 2 in an order but one was already filling for me I would definitely still try to eat both by myself though And the sandwichesalso the best in CU although I think Xinh Xinh is the only place that actually has banh mi sandwiches Theres a variety to choose from but I tried the grilled pork sandwich The size was just right It had plenty of the delicious traditional fillings like pickled radish and carrots jalapenos cilantro etc The pork was super tasty and there was plenty of it The prices were reasonable for this area  about 2 for the drinks 4 for appetizers and sandwiches and 7 for the pho all prices approximate I also just noticed that Xinh Xinh has weekly specials for things not on the menu like rice dishes Ill have to try that next time Theres actually a lot of other things I want to try Service is still pretty fast even though I only saw one waiter For takeout I would call ahead Overall I love this place and I will definitely be coming back as much as I can as long as the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff never changes Ok this review got pretty longbut this place is great Go try it nowThe Best Vietnamese Pho in town Came here often because it was fast service The bean sprouts and cilantro leaves was always fresh Broth was clean and flavorful Definitely a place to check out if you are into pho The owner is from Cali so I knew at that point that he knows how good pho tastesMy boyfriend and I got takeout for dinner one evening and were very happy with everything We ordered online and our order took roughly 15 minutes before pickup I ordered pho and my boyfriend had a vermicelli bowl  both were very aesthetically pleasing and delicious We also had the shrimp cake summer roll appetizer which I would strongly recommend tryingOverall great price food and service Will be back for sureIm no pho expert  Ive only had it a couple times in my life but Xinh Xinh makes some pretty good pho in my opinion  I had the combination pho which came with a variety of meats including some raw ribeye which cooked beautifully in the delicious hot broth  The pho came with the standard pho accoutrements: basil lime and sprouts  I also had the lime soda which was nice and refreshing but Id probably skip it the next time I visit  Seems a bit overpriced for lime sugar and club soda in a cup  Ive also had their banh mi  The bread they use is great crusty on the outside soft and tender on the inside  Their combination bahn mi is a little funky which I attribute to the headcheese and pate but its mighty tasty  The pickled vegetables are great although I feel my sandwich had a bit too much and some bites were just bread and veggies while some were just meat and bread  However when you do find a balance between all of the components it makes for one delicious biteXinh Xinh will be my go to for Vietnamese food although I dont believe there are many options for Vietnamese food in CU anywaysAbsolutely the best place in town  I live in Chicago and find it difficult to find good places to eat while Im traveling for work  I stepped into this little restaurant once and Ive been a customer every time I visit The food is fresh tasty and unique  Dont even get me started on staff  Everyone is always so welcoming and attentive  My favorite little gem in UrbanaI was happy to find a place that made banh mi in this town  Ive tried about half of all the different types and my favorite is still the black pepper chicken  The vegetables are fresh and crisp the jalapeno is spicy and it is a really refreshing sandwich  The pho is also good the vermicelli is better personal preference  Im excited about the 5 dollar vermicelli Monday lunch specials"

    "review":"I think Pancheros is still a solid 3star place but in general Ive noticed that the staff are more upbeat and pleasant to interact with since my last review  I dont really feel like the burritos I get are super consistentsometimes its really really good sometimes it just seems off  Not sure why  I got a chicken burrito the other day with my usual hot tomatillo salsa and for some reason it was ungodly spicy which its never been before and my esophagus was burning the rest of the night  Yikes  Not sure what changed but Ive never had that experience and I pretty much order the same thing every timeUnbearably slow and not nearly as good as ChipotleThe line in front of me today at the noon hour was ten deep and four of those people were placing orders for their office so the ten I saw were equivalent to 30 ordersAverage to poor for quality and taste We stopped by with hopes of having of a Chipotlelike experience Despite a carbon copy approach to food this place was uninspiring bland There were too many uncharges for basic items such as fajita veggie The food was not seasoned and my bowl was simply pitiful They get a couple of points for cleanliness and service Too bad the food left our entire party of 6 disappointedBurrito bowl with rice carnitas queso veggies guacamole sour cream verde salsa most were adders Food tasted great With tea was over 12Didnt see lettuce as an option like Chipotle Didnt seem as fresh either Close to work so Ill probably eat here again but very pricey for what it is However hardly anyone was here so I doubt it will be around in a yearIm surprised by the other reviewers here Are fresh tortillas really a gimmick The fresh tortillas are what this Pancheros apart from Chipotle and Qdoba who pull stale tortillas out of a plastic bag Thats huge for my money at leastPeople some to be upset that the service unbearably slow which is kind of nonsensical insofar as this is an orderatthecounter restaurant where the food is made right before your eyes If one cannot wait in a line and then have a burrito prepared fresh then one should stick to McDonalds where the food is always fastSurprisingly I see relatively few complaints about the actual taste of the food Well few specific complaints that is For me the freshness is the key Qdoba always serves me lukewarm chicken that has been sitting out for hours and Chipotles meats are so oversalted as to be criminal The salsas have variety and one can get a nice tomatobased salsa that tastes fresh and light My criticism is that their steak can be a bit tough but then again so is Chipotles The chicken is usually tender with a nice grilled flavor Overall I think the fresh tortillas really make the difference They dont keep massive quantities in the warming trays before they want to serve it fresh and hot Ill happily wait if I get fresh foodThe tortillas here are pressed right in front of you but I thought it tasted doughy  Also the fillings were skimpy and made my tortilla sopping wet by the time I sat down  The taste was just ok  Also as I pressed the button to fill my fountain drink it all came spraying at me in all different directions soaking my hair clothes and Even in my shoes  When my fianc went and told an employee about it the only response was  oh The sign fell down  Not even a sorry or offering me some paper towels  So needless to say since I dont like shitty food shitty service and taking a root beer shower I wont be coming back"

    "review":"Beckman Cafe has the nicest staff and worthy of 5stars simply for that The ladies working there are super friendly and nice to every single person that walks in and they always make my day The food is good too standard cafeteria fare as well as some unique options They always have one or two vegetarian entrees in addition to the salad bar so thats a plus for those who dont eat meat The only drawback is they dont accept credit cards just cash or checkA great place to get decently healthy reasonably priced food in the area Far better than the other options in the area Its not a hard choice between Perkins Don Juan Hot Wok Taco Bell or the Beckman CafeThere are days where food here is 4 star worthy and there are days where the food quality just lets you down So its pretty hit or miss The nice thing about their online menu is that you can plan things out ahead of time The cooksservers can also have their off days for sure Sometimes theyre so friendly it freaks me out They can also get so picky about things that dont matter and give you quite the attitude I suppose I might feel similarly if I was a career line cookThe Beckman Cafe is notable among University of Illinois lunch counters and probably lunch counters the world over for having the friendliest lunch ladies aroundGreek Salad day is a winner:  sometimes its all that gets me through my 65 hour long grad student work weekAs stated before they are SO nice here The specials change daily and it is a pretty great deal for homemade soups and sandwiches or if you are in the area and need a cup of coffee and a snack A cup of soup and half of a sandwich a huge half will set you back about 6 The soups are very good Ive tried the Provencal Tomato and the Spinach and Cheese Both had lots of vegetables and were perfect after a very chilly walk to the building The multigrain bread they use for the sandwiches is really good Ive had the chicken salad the avocado chicken salad and the egg salad My only complaint is that the salads are a bit mayonnaiseheavy but this might be a regional thing The avocado chicken salad was also very oniony Id stick with the regular chicken saladOn Thursdays at noon they have concerts in the atrium area that are quite nice if you need a break from your labwork or studiesThey do not accept cards so keep some cash handyI tried the pecancranberry chicken salad and it had the perfect amount of mayo yay It was verrrry chunky though prepare yourself by grabbing a fork tooIve also now tried the tomato bisque which is deliciousThis is a strange place but it has its pleasures It is a cafeteria with extremely plain mid Midwestern offerings My take: It is what it is Sometimes I want Midwestern cafeteria comfort food If I do it is OK to come here But if Im honest I cant tell you that this is a good restaurant Hence the twostar ratingFive funny things about it:1 Its male It is always full of scientists and engineers from the Beckman and CSL Perhaps for that reason it is one of the few establishments that I have entered on a busy day and noticed that of the 20 patrons there are zero women2 Its universityrun Since it is run by the university a sign says that you can pay by university purchase order if you want to  I have never seen anyone do this3 The secret garden You can eat in a garden that almost no one uses or knows about  to find it you must leave via the West door It is dedicated to women in science4 The regulars Some people show up at the counter and are served without ordering I asked a staff member about this and she said Hes been wanting the mac and cheese for thirteen years5 The almostfree salad I stuff as much into the container as I can and yet after it is weighed I am charged something like 82 cents Dressing extra Although it is a very plain salad barMost of the food is actually prepared at a food service warehouse somewhere else I asked when I saw tortilla crusted tilapia with long grain wild rice and Kyoto mixed vegetables and the lemon mist cake Once you see the place youll have a hard time imagining them preparing the tilapia and baking the cake from scratch in the back room and it turns out they dont  But both dishes are OK Some of the offerings dont bother Creambased soups are a disgusting glopSome of the naming conventions on the menu make me smile with white sauce   Ground beef steak  a hamburger pattySome things Heck yeah Jambalaya is good The pot roast is good The hamburger ground beef steak is good I agree with Sarah H  the pecancranberry chicken salad is the big winner Delicious And the staff are delightful  Theyll loan you money Theyll change the dishes around for you  Theyll sneak you extra food and not charge you for it if you are even a little nice to themYou can check the menu online before you go: http:wwwbeckmanillinoiseducafeNote that they run out of their main dishes almost every day usually after about 90 minutesIn sum Its a strange little cafeteria But it may be worth visiting at least once just to hang around a weird cafeteria full of weird scientists"

    "review":"The food is good The specialty lemonades and tees are usually mixed at the proper ratios Mistakes are fairly rare but its worth checkin your food before you leave if using the drive through The one major issue with this Wendys is its ridiculously over complicated and unnecessary parking lot and drive through layout Not only does it result in wasted space and not enough parking spots but the radii of the corners and lanes are far too tight for most cars to make without a 3 point turn Its a brand new building and unfortunately will need renovation soon Otherwise a good Wendys with friendly staffRestaurant reviewHow do you judge a fast food restaurant By there freshness of the food the cleanliness and the staff I ended up here to get a quick salad to go for lunch trying to be healthy and the summer salads are great The food was definitely prepared fast and the restaurant was clean even though I was taking out the food Staff friendliness was so so The cashier barely looked me in the eye as I put in my order At least they take expired jr frosty coupons which was given to me at another location as a substitute for kids toys as they ran out The sald itself was very fresh and filled to the brim I had no issue with the quality I didnt even realize they gave me two packets of salad dressing One is definitely not enough Overall if I want Wendys close to work i will be back maybe through the drive thru next timePros: inexpensive fast service cleanCons: lack of interaction and poor eye contact with staffHidden deals:The 4 for four is a steal A drink fries 4 nuggets and a jr bacon cheeseburger Favorite fast food meal of the summer 2016So I come in here and it seems that the boss is displeased with the way things are running and is voicing her displeasure to their workers Alright awkward Despite its recent opening this seems like your standard fare of Wendys"

    "review":"this is a real woohoo  that pizza is delicious its cheap as heck and okay are you SO lazy you cant pick up a raw pizza and cook it yourself i found the sausage pizzared sauce a bit salty but the veggie is unique and deliciousWonderful bakeit yourself pizza  My friend and I always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese  Theres a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach thats great as well  They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also  Service went downhill there for awhilethey had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing because they were wanting to clean up for the night  But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice again  Prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality  A winnerNice fast and friendly staff I love love love their Hawaiian pizzaPapa Murphys is cheap and I can make it at my convenience at home  Cant argue with thatunlike most other pizza places the size of their pies has not shrunk over time to try to garner more profits but the prices have gone up but I can get an easy to modify pizza with a variety of toppings and they dont charge me an extra 2 per change like some other placesYeah its not instantly hot and I have to cook it at home but that is what makes it so you can get a huge pizza for the price of a tiny pizza from pizza hitPapa Murphys has a life long customer in meThough technically this is a chainfranchise and the product is standardized their pizza is actually a very good value and good quality for the price Yes you have to bake it at home but I think that the end result is better than takeout delivery or frozen because you can enjoy the pizza hotout the oven Combined with any promotions or coupons thru the mail you get twice as much for your money compared to eating out With leftover pizza this or any other wrap in foil while still warm then freeze not refrigerate You can microwave or pop into a toaster oven and enjoy better leftovers than if you leave in the fridgeIts convenient and hot  because I bake it and cheap if you can catch a deal  They hire kids that dont care much about the customers  If your not a regular that they recognize you might get treated ok You might not  Tonight I ordered extra cheese as one of my 5 topping for 10 Tues and barely got any cheese on my pizza  While others walked out with their pizzas loaded  Im soooo done with this location  The staff changes often  they need an adult  manager or assistant present during prime hours"

    "review":"My favorite CU barNice place  on campus but without a heavy Illini feel  I first started going because I was underage and they didnt card way back when but kept going after I was legal because its a good spot to eat and talk  They cook excellent burgers and fries and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine  Many beers on tap and knowledgable bartendersAh Murphys The one place where townies undergrads and graduate students actually mingleThe decor is kind of dingy but in a really endearing sort of way All the seats have names and years carved into them and the walls are covered in beer memorabilia The food is pretty good for Campustown I like the burgers and fries Theyre appropriately greasy and when on special you cant beat the price The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but hey its not perfectWhat you go to Murphys for is the beer The draft list is surprisingly extensive and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak says the guy whos finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints the specials are fantastic you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for 5 or less and they have specialty pints for 250 on Thursdays And its not bad beer either I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard but they even have some decent IPAs on tap sayeth my beer snob friends Murphys is often crowded and for graduate students theres a very real risk of running into students but its my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overallGood times with friends and cheap beers and thats pretty much itThe food is not bad but its just bar food so u cant expect much The Irish Nachos is good to order with two more people The other appetizers are just ok hmm the spicy cheese bites are good although small but theres usually some food special everydayBecause of the regular coming you develop certain bonds with the place even if the place is not great If this bar was located anywhere outside Campus I dont think I would ever go there However the memories make the place and thats pretty much how Murphys survivesgood times from college my favorite bar in the area always go there when im down and always made sure to bring out of town people there when i came drinks will be the cheapest compared to everywhere else in the area Food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss ive had great irish nachos and ive had terrible irish nachos there SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude 1st examplestanding at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink next thing i know the bartender is in my face waving your money around wont get you served faster What the hell i was standing there holding it on the bar i wasnt even looking at you i was watching tv 2nd examplecrowded for unofficial so im sure they are stressed close out my tab paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip hey buddy thats really a jerk thing to do thanks again what the hell can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping 3rd exampleusually the irish nachos are covered in toppings most recent time hardly any go back up to counter its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy Can i get some more toppings please i didnt get very much Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother answers slowly yeah i guess i can he was pissed Dude calm down i just want more toppings didnt say it was terrible get over yourself thank god i love this place except the servers and not all are bad just mostMurphys was always my favorite bar in college and when I returned recently it was just the same as I remember it Its a divey atmosphere so they almost never have cover only on Homecoming weekend and the like and the vibe is very relaxed Old school high top tables and wooden booths have been etched and written on until theres very little left of the original finish but thats half the fun They have great drink specials and amazing Irish nachos I was feeling so nostalgic on my last visit here that I ended up coming two nights in a row This is definitely the best bar on campus hands downThe first rating was overgenerous  Its still good but three stars seem more appropriate than four"

    "review":"Wow  It is sooo hard in a college town to get a review that is accurate   There is such a difference between a college student with a limited budget and a foodie type of review For the record  I am a foodie  We almost did not go to dinner here at Timpones because of reviews  We are absolutely pleased that we did  The BEST I have had in ten years for real   I had sea bass w clams and mussels The sauce was divine  It was music in my mouth  And the pizza yes the pizza   beyond outstanding   I generally do not care for pizza and if you are looking for ooey gooey cheap cheese this is NOT it  We had the regular pizza and added sausage mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes  They accommodated us creating our own pizza no questions asked   We wanted to return the next day to eat again but unfortunately they were not open on Sunday  Extreme perfection This was the first time in two years that I returned to the restaurant  primarily because the average cost of a meal is about 35 dollars per person with tip We ordered the grouper and the pasta with bolognaise sauce and their thin crust pizza Overall the dining experience was mixed The service was pretty good but the food was just blah The grouper wasnt presented well and it was such a small plate the pizza was a fig pizza gorgazola proscuitto was a little dry  the combination of ingredients didnt work but the pasta was very tasty  again  very small plates What s dreadful about this restaurant is the ambiance and the decor circa 80s and that they charge 1 for an order of six slices of bread When asked we were told that patrons have asked for refills and the management was covering costs what a lame excuse  Also its not as though they served bread thats to die for  its just a VERY small loaf of freshly baked bread  no big dealTry another restaurant  i wont be going back anytime soonThis is the only restaurant where my husband and I eat  we live about 15 mins away  the food is always excellent and the service is fantastic  We tried Silver Creek last year when Timpones was closed and will NOT ever go back  It doesnt get any better than Rays caesars pastas and Gingers desserts  The pasta is to perfection and the duck and the pizza  you cant go wrong and if you dont like it  find the closest McDonalds because that must be what your taste buds are geared towardOkay I went for my second visitJust as absolutely fantastic as the first  We had the salad with asparagus and a poached eggthe bomb  We had pizza again We noticed every single table had a pizza on it  That says it all The BEST And the macadamia crusted Mahi was divine  The sauce was to die for We fought over it at the table yes we share good food amongst friends  Remarkable food The best in UrbanaIve been eating at Timpones for about 25 years   This is one of the best choices for fine dining in CU   The food is always excellent  The menu is constantly changing but they always have nice fish meat and pasta choices   Many people love their pizza   The longtime favorite appetizer is Frito Misto usually shrimp calamari scallops with a garlic aioli on top and a spicy tomatobased sauce below  Highly recommended   Desserts are always interesting and wonderful  The service varies as they do have a lot of turnover with students that come and go   But the food makes up for inconsistency in serviceTimpones always has an interesting menu with delicious foods The service can be slow sometimes though Most disappointing is that they wont make any substitutions on food I wanted to substitute garlic for olives on a pizza but they said no You would think that a restaurant with that price of food would accommodate this with their customers I also recommend that they refill iced tea rather than bringing a whole new glass and straw It is a greener way All that said the food is always wonderful and it is an excellent place to go for a special meal"

    "review":"It was such a great one but it took long time to get it And they made a mistake to make foods and did not keep the number or order I think that they arent ready to business Otherwise their fried Chickens are awesome and very delicious except their servicesI ordered their original olive chicken and their sweet and spicy chicken This place is pretty pricey for the food that you get but I will say that their original olive chicken was a good starter to go with However I think their sweet and spicy chicken was a bit over spiced I normally am okay with medium spicy foods but this was way too spicy for me I got my food relatively quickly although the service seemed chaotic in the back I also got the wrong order which I didnt notice until later I got takeout I wish they had more options especially with their garlic trio option  I wouldve liked to have been able to try one or two of those flavors without having to order all three but this place seems decent Their menu screen kept flickering which was slightly annoying when I was trying to read the menu Id honestly probably wait a couple of weeks to a month before coming here again and hopefully by then theyve added more options  finished polishing their recipesside note: Thank goodness I ate the original chicken first because after the sweet and spicy chicken I could hardly taste anything because my mouth had gone numbIts okaycertainly not among the best I have had I would recommend Starkaraokes chicken moreChicken is not bad But it is too pricy 12 you can only get 1 wing 1 small drumstick 2 big chicken bones with meat on the surfaceI like the most spicy Garlic triored hot garlic Order it ever time I have been thereThe olive fried chicken was excellent  Have had it twice so far  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu"

    "review":"This was an ok place when it was around 7 a meal students would stock up and make it their only meal of the day ultimately filling the belly and saving a bit of cashThe only real saving grace for this place is that you can bill a departmental account I highly suspect thats the primary reason we see Profs and visitors here often  I personally apologize for the food when there with guests The waiters arent really waiters but sort of Ill get you your drink when I feel like iters  Ill just ignore this stack of used dishes while asking if you want coffeeersThe dishes remind me of school cafeteria food but from chefs who passed the next level up of culinary cafeteria school  I think I may have finished my salad All else left me cold and wanting Try to avoid if you can Unfortunately all my grad friends somehow think this is all a good deal for 10Seriously can it be called a place to eat if they cant even serve a glass of coke with carbonation left Do they pour them in the morning for the lunch hourHighlights Expresso RoyaleBar table and lounge seatingWirelessStudy areasRelaxedCleanComfortableQuietRecyclingWaterRestroomsFriendly peopleMTD accessibleNewly remodeledAwesome landmarkIf you ever feel the need for illprepared food in a funeralhomeesque atmosphere this place is for you The last time I was here it was when a visiting scholar was in town so someone got the bright idea of bringing her here We loaded up our plates with watery cottage cheese and wilted lettuce and sat down The conversation kind of mimicked the food: bland and predictable Maybe youll have better luck but man I thought this was just about the worst place on campus to eat See my review for the Krannert cafe which is at least doableI love this placemy sister first turned me onto it when we were both students in the 80s  first of all its incredibly cheap 795 for lunch dessert soda and coffee  the students who work here are all on the work study program so you should definitely tip them well considering the food is so cheap and these kids can really use the doughthe architecture in here is awesome  mostly faculty staff are dining here so be prepared to see your professors if you are a student or your colleagues if youre a worker beethe food is actually quite good  you can make a super salad with actual dark green leaves and some nice additives  they always have nice vegetarian options for entrees and soup as wellthis is a great place to meet a group and really feel collegiateThis place is a little expensive when you consider the following:  1 The service is atrocious 2 they stop making a lot of the food early  I like to go from time to time for London Broil it tastes great  But if I arrive a little late but still within the time that the place is open I might not get the food I came for  They stop cooking the food eve though people have still paid to be there  The staff has been rude and slow for as long as I have been coming  Its embarrassing when you bring people from out of town like visiting lecturers etcThree stars for good food minus two stars for being lazy and rudeWith no visible signs or advertising you could easily overlook this place during your entire stint at the university  By the way you can find it on the second floor northwestern corner of the Union  I would recommend this place for guests of the Union Hotel who want to stick close to their rooms or anyone else who wants a slightly classier lunch option compared to the mallstyle food court in the Unions basement  My department often takes visiting professors and job candidates here for lunch mostly because it is no fuss yet still feels professional  Although there are no actual restrictions against the public dining here the location and atmosphere make it a more appropriate lunch option for the university community and campus visitors  Food is served buffetstyle with daily soups salad bar sandwich bar hot bar and desserts  In terms of quality Im pretty sure that the Ballroom uses the same food service company as the campus dining halls  Theres a good selection of crunchy veggies on the salad bar meats and cheeses for sandwiches and other items but I cant help but feel that Im reliving a slightly upscale version of my dorm years  The hot bar is surprisingly good and probably the only part of the menu that sees significant rotation Ive never seen the same thing on the hot bar twice in a month  This can be great if you plan to eat here regularly and dont like repetition it sucks once youve found something you really like and know theres a slim chance of seeing it again  Some of the past items Ive really enjoyed include: chicken piccata eggplant parmesan and potatocrusted fried fish  There is usually a vegetarian entree and sides and the staff are good at answering questions if you have dietary restrictionsTime has passed since Yelpers wrote about this place and the price has rose to around 10 per person  This price includes access to the full buffet plus beverages and I think it is comparable to what youd probably pay at other buffet places"

    "review":"Service is nice We went on a weekday for lunch so it wasnt very busyClean and well kept restaurant If you are looking for homely traditional pizza it is not the place for youWe had the artichoke pizza with artichokes black olives cheese and sliced meatball The flavors were all over the place When you make a pizza it is so important that the toppings complement each other The toppings on this here are all substitutes of each other there is too much tartness from the olive and artichoke that the sourness overrides any other tasteIt was delicious High quality ingredients It wasnt super expensive The food did not take very long to get to our table after ordering We had the Hawaiian pizza The prosciutto was to die for There didnt seem to be any wait staff on duty when we visited but the bartender did an excellent job waiting tables and taking care of the bar He was super nice and friendly but not obnoxious He also sent us home with a carry out menu that I am sure we will make good use out ofNot bad  The food is decent but not spectacular a little too Californiastyle for my tastes I prefer Chicagostyle pizza but my wife and daughter liked itThe staff was great all very friendly and professional which is what made me put this at 3 stars instead of 2The prices are a bit steepBest service at any restaurant in town  Jared was our server and he did an excellent job taking caring of usWe got the spinach and artichoke dip 4x4 pizza and the spicy shrimp pizza  Everything was very good The shrimp was cooked perfectly and not overly seasoned However there wasnt much spice to it  I didnt mind because I dont like too much heat but my boyfriend thought it could have used more  Overall we still very much liked it It was our first time tonight but we will definitely be back  I dont normally write yelp reviews in fact this is my first yelp review   I was compelled to write a review for Brixx because the food and service is great and it definitely warrants more than 25 starsPlace was busy we sat at the bar  Great pizza and great service from bartender Jakeevery time Im here the food and service are excellent Ask for Adam hes special cloth Jill is pretty cool too"

    "review":"Chipotle may not be authentic Mexican but it does set itself apart from other chains The primary reason to go to Chipotle is the quality of the ingredients Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version Its also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian but in my opinion the pork is really the best This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meatcheeserice and sometimes notits rather bizarre but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the Ilini secret specialIts quite expensive as fast food goes and it gets crowded I usually take mine to go since every Chipotle Ive visited has had a harried atmosphere that makes dining in unpleasantbut even if it upscale fast food its still fast food so thats what I expectmmmmI love the Burrito BowlI think you get more for your money  They have their signature Rice with Lime  Cilantro now with Brown Rice  And I love the GuacomoleMmmmmI go here all the time and the employees always get me the usual Always delicious The line can be very long sometimes thoughAlways get the fajita burrito with extra rice My chipotle experiances have always been great except for this chipotle The service is not super friendly and when then put the meat on your burrito they dont put alot There is always a long line which is usually acceptable except when the line has to fold into the eating area This chipotles burritos are usally 34 the size of the ones i get made for me at other chipotle places Still this chipotle is able to fix my chipotle fixGood till the last drop Healthy and tasty and cheapOne of my peers is a native of Mexico and I asked him what he really felt about this place His exact words were Its just like Taco Bell Its nice to get a natives perspective on our Americanized Mexican food I gotta say that the food is fairly delicious and filling though but it does cost a bit too much for it"

    "review":"Heard about this on Yelp my girlfriend and I went there for the first time today I lived in Japan for 9 weeks a couple years ago and understand the quality of food and service that you get there but I certainly wouldnt hold restaurants in Champaign to that same standard This is a small University town and access to fresh seafood is limited at bestHaving said that I was rather underwhelmed by Sushi Kame The server a middleaged Korean lady was very demanding and impatient My girlfriend takes a long time to decide what she wants and when we were given the extensive menu I knew it would be a while So I asked the server if we could order the egg yolk sauce with rice dish sidedish while we looked at the menu She gave me a very accusing look as though I was committing some sort of crime and then scampered off to put the order inWhen she returned  I attempted to order several more authentic Japanese items like kama toro uni and oyster only to find none of these were in season We settled on a special spicy salmon roll the green turtle roll and several pieces of nigiriAs others have mentioned before the egg yolk sauce with rice was really delicious It is very rich so you will need to share it with someone The sushi was rather ordinary by Champaign standards The rolls fell apart prematurely indicating the rice did not have the right consistencystickiness The ginger was mild in flavor the wasabe obviously dyed horseradish and I swear they served regular soy sauce not the special variety for sushi because it was extremely saltyI cant comment on other dishes on the menu and they may be delicious but Im not likely to come here again For me the rudeness of the server coupled with the subpar sushi was enough to deter me from this restaurantI definitely got food poisoning from this place I do not usually have a sensitive stomach and this is a very rare occurrence for me Other than the food poisoning it was good though I went there for lunch and got the sushi bento box The food was average but it was also a good amount of food for being relatively inexpensiveGreat sushi They also hook you up with appetizers like Miso soup noodle salad I recommend you try the roll with the baked smoked salmon You really cant go wrong with any of their rollsWe went here for lunch today and were SO pleased Thank you yelpers for directing us here We got two rolls and the sushi bento box and enjoyed everything we got  The LoveLove roll was especially good with each bite a little explosion of flavor from the cilantro spicy sauce and pepper  Everything tasted fresh and was neatly prepared and while California rolls are usually just sushi filler the two pieces in the bento box were fantastic and would actually be worth ordering on their own  The Sunset roll was expensive but good  We will definitely be backThe asparagus beef roll was delicious And u have to try the teriyaki beef Its really tender and tastyAfter trying four different sushi restaurants in the area I would without a doubt say Sushi Kame ranks above them all I came here with a couple of friends on a Wednesday night and had a very pleasant experienceThe service was very good After taking our order we were served some miso soup followed by some cold noodles Our sushi rolls were brought out not long after the noodles Between my friends and I we ordered rolls of spicy tuna negi hemachi sp unagi dragon shrimp tempura and crab Everything tasted great However I personally liked the dragon unagi and spicy tuna above the others It can become a little pricey but it is worth it for good sushi in this town Overall it was a  pleasant experience and I shall be returning soon"

    "review":"Great place Great atmosphere Great food Coffee leaves something to be desired however And there is an unfortunate lack of electrical outlets Laptoppers bewareWent by after work which isnt that late around 5pm to pick up some bagels for breakfast and discovered that this location closes at 3pm I could have sworn that Ive had dinner at Panera before so it must be a quirk of this particular onePanera is great The salads sandwiches and soups are wonderful I really like that you can customize your order by replacing an ingredient or going without it Makes your order a little healthier I have cravings for their Mediterranean egg white sandwich The salad varieties are always creative The asiago cheese bagel is delicious I also like their granola parfaits You really cant go wrong with any of the options there The service is fast and friendly too Great place for a U of I student to grab a bite and study at the same time I had an oatmeal raisin cookie there once and it was perfectly chewy got it for free I also like that the MyPanera rewards card gets you rewards like free drinks pastries soups etc The only thing I dont like about Panera is the calorie count of their foods but its nice to splurge every once in a while Im so grateful they post their nutrition information online and in the storeI went in to get some cupcakes but there were flies sitting all over the cakes and scones  I lost my appetite and left the place They should at least have a plastic cover for all of the pastries like Atlanta Bread It was disgusting Sanitary issueeeeeThe paninis are generally the best sandwiches to order Overall this place is fairly average You get a pretty solid sandwich if youre hungryThe food was what I expected from Panera The apple Fuji salad was delicious My wife enjoyed her salad too Although they forgot to put dressing on her salad When I brought it to their attention that they forgot the dressing they insisted that they did but gave me salad dressing still The most irritating part was that after we started to eat they decided to clean around our table They were cleaning the AC vent and the hanging light fixtures that were hanging above and around the table A little consideration would be nice Having dirt fall on you from above and around you is not a pleasant way to eat your food"

    "review":"I thought Zas had the most diverse pizza choices until I can here Zas offers nearly infinite permutations of toppings but Antonios offers other forms of diversity in the form of quirky crusts and toppings There is tortellini pizza covered with surpriseoodles of tortellini or the chicken blue pizza which is basically a chicken wing on a crust Personally I like the sicilian cheese pizza which has a buttery flaky crust that beats out any other pizza in the area However I do think freshness and ingredient quality is a problem here as well as typical Americanpizza greasiness Its better than many of the pizza places on Green st but still suffers from collegepizza syndromeLOVE Antonios Their slices are large and often available in any variety Chicken Bacon Ranch is by far one of my top pizzas on campus I order it every time and it never fails to satisfyWhen I first came to U of I I liked this place  It is close to the main quad as opposed to many places that are past  6th or 5th street and it is convenient if you need a quick bitePizza quality is meh pretty oily crust is lacking with regard to flavor They have daily specials such as buy 2 slices get a free drink and buy 2 slices and get a 3rd slice free but I have not had good experience with these  The first time I went I bought 2 slices and as the person was ringing me up I saw the sign on the side and inquired about my free drink it was during the free drink time she responded with much attitude you could have told me but she did give me my drink  Another time I went during the buy 2 get a 3rd free time and asked for 2 slices of cheese pizza  As they were being reheated I was asked to pay so I did  Still waiting for my pizza to be reheated I noticed the sign  I inquired about the 3rd slice but was told that I had to have asked before paying  I asked if I could be refunded and then they could reprocess my order but the guy said he couldnt do that  He said he had to keep track of the pizzas otherwise he would get fired mind you I have seen them throw away old pizza slices when they are running out of room for their new pizzas  He then went on about the various signs everywhere displaying the deals which by the way are small and how his outdoor sign kept falling over   I didnt feel the need to argue any further so I waited for my pizza  The guy then stepped back and whispered to the other guys behind the counter after which they just happened to say the same things he did pointing out the same outdoor sign and all  I took my pizza and left and dont really feel like going there againAt last Thin crust pizza Portlandians if you are cravings Hot Lips and you are somehow stuck in CU this is probably your best option I go to Antonios when I want pizza and I dont have time to wait 45 minutes to an hour for pizza at Dells I am a pepperoni man but the other custom pizzas have looked tempting Comparing the price to quality the quality slightly outweighs the costs The staff is friendly and I like that they have copies of the Daily Illini to read in case you did not bring friends with you to socializeLoved it  Very inexpensive pizza  14 for two Large pizzas 16 inch  Was fast and a very excellent tasting East coast pizza  New York Style  Would definitely go here again  Not sure how eating in is but the inside is really small and it seems they only offer slices of a few types of pizza  Only downside was that one of our pizzas was barely cooked  We threw it in the oven for a few minutes though once we got home and it was as good as ever  All and all really delicious pizza for very cheap pricesOne of my favorite places to go in Chambana land Big New York style pizza slices and man do they have options They have so many different kinds of pizzas with combinations you would never even think of  from putting pasta tortellini on there Mexican pizzas with actual tortilla chips baked potatoes and they all taste awesome My all time favorite though is the Chicken Bacon Ranch SICILIAN slices I could seriously have that be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life Great place to come for the drunken munchies after the bars or at any other time of the day Be warned though if you go after the bars close or near that time you will be standing around for quite a whilebut so worth it"

    "review":"YUMMYI love this place large enough to hold 17 girls for a big dinner party in the other room  Crispy tofu and eggplant were the highlights of the night  Ended up being 8 pp  What a dealFood was okay not great but not bad I got basil chicken and the sauce was good but the chicken was inconsistently cooked Also there was a long thin strip of aluminum foil in my food for some reason I cant imagine why this would happen Its also worth pointing out the health department has put a must review again sign on their door because it didnt exactly pass its inspection I dont know about that but I can verify the whole place was about as clean as a low end gas station including menus and tables which really bothered some of the people I was with Id give it 3 stars without this but really clean your place if youre serving foodThis is a very good place for authentic southern Chinese food on campus Even my parents they are Chinese like this place I order their chicken fried rice with salty fish at least three times a month Its so good and absolutely authentic Its not getting five stars because you get less amount of food for the same price compared to four years ago I guess this is predictable because of the inflation and increase in cost This is also the only place serving dim sum in Champaign as of today I cant say its dim sum is great but its acceptable if you are craving for someSmall portions compared to the rest of the asian places on green st especially when the price is almost the same The food is good thoughThe food is all right Just like the other chinese restaurant on green street the positioning of what kinda food it shall serve is very bad How could a restaurant try to cook all styles of chinese food Chinese cuisine aint American fried shit Trying to make everything always end up failing at everythingAmazed by the variety of choices Dim sum is available Tasty and authentic The only concern is the unsanitary look"

    "review":"Sweating was prompt 7pm Saturday night Room is half full Music to a dull roar Not too loud Lighting is easy on the eyes Waitress is attentive to start She had recommendations We ordered beer and appetizers Appetizer was the blue cheese chips Not much flavor Needed more seasoning The other was the lime shrimp cocktail Its warm which is weird Good flavor though Menu is burgers wraps salads like ten different kinds and grill items Also have a gluten free menu that is a pick a protein and two veggies for 1399 steak salmon or chicken Had the chicken not a 14 meal but now I dont feel bad about what I ate Molly had the chicken cease salad wrap She took half home and claims it was good Also got fries She says they had steak seasoning on them Service was fast and attentive We were in and out in under an hour Many tv screens and a few craft beersThis place frequently mails out coupons to the local area so I had been looking forward to it for a while The first thing you notice when you step in is the numerous largescreen TVs There was nothing interesting showing when I came but I imagine this would be a great place to watch major sports events like NFL games and the NCAA basketball tournament The restaurant is located within a nice clubhouse so the place is clean welllit and pretty spacious In terms of atmosphere and setting theres nothing to complain about at allThe problems I had were with the food To start the water had funny taste to it Moving on to the nachos the ratio of ingredients didnt impress me They overdo the cheese and skimp on the pico de gallo The cheese is melted but the chips are cold The wings werent great being both small and overly fried But theyre just 40 cents each on Sunday so theyre still not a bad deal I wouldnt order these on any other day of the week though Sandwich wasnt bad but took a really long time to arrive Were talking 45 minutes at 11 AM on a Sunday For a sandwich and friesIll probably go back again to give the place a second chance but I wouldnt do it without more coupons My score breakdown looks something like this: 55 for the atmosphere 25 for the food 25 for the slow service 35 overallService was seamless We were seated at the same time as two 4 tops and a party of 8 that arrived at the same time as my wife and I Had no problem with getting our food That was delicious Warm and welcoming experience Will definitely be going backI was pleasantly surprised by their menu offerings I want to return and try a few things Nice variety of salads sandwiches burgers and entres to tryWe drive by Stone Creek on the way to and from work and finally decided to give Atties a try   The atmosphere was good and not too loud for a barrestaurant combo though we were there relatively early 4:30ish in the afternoon  The reuben was excellent  The fries were hohum and need to be kicked up a notch somehow  We will try a different side dish next time around   The service was outstanding  Seating was a little too close for my tastes next time we will request an out of the way table so folks wanting good TV viewing seats arent crammed in next to usCost per person was very reasonable we WILL be backThe food is OK and the decor is very nice  It is very clean too  I have booked events here in the past and had a pretty good experience but the last time I had event here was just awful  It was not so much the food but the person who helped me plan the event from Atties  She was extremely rude to me in front of everyone and instead of trying to solve the problem she got extremely defensive  Everyone made a comment that she was out of line and unprofessional  Too bad  Its a nice venue but I probably would never go back again"

    "review":"Came here on grand opening day and although it did take a while to receive my order I came back the following weekend and the service was indeed much better One of my personal favorites is their mango green tea It isnt made too sweet but isnt too bland eitherThe staff there are friendly price is reasonable and with the new addition of the daily 25 off specials as well as having met my current boyfriend here I have no choice but to give it 5 starsI come here almost every day Milk tea house is hands down my favorite place for bubble tea I used to only get their bubble tea but since I have been coming here so often I decided to try everything on their menu Though some things are pricey they are all so delicious and worth it Except maybe the roasted sweet potato because it was just a sweet potato lolIf I could give this place 10 stars it still wouldnt be enough to describe how good evening was from the service to the food PerfectThe Milk Tea House has so many amazing reviews and I really loved the decor the service and the amazing foosball table that I almost won at the best This tea house is located inside a small restaurant cove on the second floor highly unsuspecting I ordered the green tea bubble tea with boba and my friend ordered the vanilla milk tea I found my green tea to be refreshing but not the sort of consistency and flavor Im used to I love green tea and this one fell sort of short on the tea flavor However I will return as so many reviews quote the Milk Tea House as having other amazing drinks Perhaps they have hidden fortes in other teas I did enjoy the boba consistency and flavor it was quite deliciousThe wait is long but I can understand it They dont pre make things However the powder they use for the drinks is too sweet and overwhelming And my coffee jelly was hard : not a fanThe first time I went with my girlfriend she had a disappointing experience with their macha bubble tea while I got the mango bubble tea which was soso I went again and order the almond bubble tea and it was complete trash I only took two sips before throwing it out This place is garbage"

    "review":"Food is delicious and portions are extremely generous for the price The place may look a little janky but defintely worth stopping by Usually a 2 combo platter with rice or noodles mei fun can make you pretty stuffed They also have a wide variety to choose from Never tried their entrees but the platters that you pick from are always deliciouswe can no longer call this place HOGsince they added the ThaiDelivery is nice  Tofu Pad Thai not so nice  Lacking a few of the standard components  Also super hot like it cleared out my sinuses hotNext time ill stick to some standard Chinese fareIts super authentic and the portion size you get for the price is insane 700 is enough to fill you up and leave you with left overs for a second meal I used to go there all the time for a quick and cheap lunch Note that seating is limited so I would recommend getting takeoutMan this place is so packed during lunch hours It can get uncomfortable to dine in with so many people moving through the dining area If youre looking to sit down and eat you should take your food and walk across to the first floor of the Psychology building I gotta say that Im disappointed that they dont have fried rice Also apparently half and half where you order half rice and half noodles is not a thing here youre forced to choose one or the other In addition its only steamed rice and not fried rice I do like the free water bottles that come with your orders thoughCan we say gross I had their quick lunch  2 entree combo for 650 and omg it was horrible Its not as if I had high expectations I just wanted something edible for lunch The fried rice is super soysauced and brown which is not the way it should be The orange chicken was nothing like Panda Express an Americanized Chinese chain out West Literally I went orange eating it SadnessIve been here again since my first review Instead of the rice I got noodles much better choice I got the green beans which are as good as ever I also got the  mapo tofu which was good as well I tried the beef and chicken and I still think the meat tastes strange but now Im starting to think its the seasoning The chicken wasnt totally gross this time"

    "review":"Really good atmosphere this bright and fun campus location features a menu on flat screen TVs Korean tacos and burritos sushi bi bim bap etcI love their food My favorite are their burritos because they make the tortilla crispy The flavors are Korean flavors so it is not your typical burrito It is quite a unique food experienceIm not from Illinois but I came to take a look around the campus with a friend Being fans of everything Korean we decided to stop by at the Spoon House I tried their spicy seafood platter and loved it It was well worth the priceI also got the Korean quesadillataco Those tasted not so great and oddly sweetNot bad but there are better options nearby I like Arirang a little better and WooriJib even more There are better places a bit further away like Kbowl which I highly recommend and Star Karaoke which is in SavoyI come here primarily for two dishes: Bibim nyang myun and the crispy spicy chicken both of which are pretty good Prices are a bit high but they have introduced some cheaper dishes recently The major complaint I have is with the fruit flies Winter summerwhenever theyre always there flying around you No other place on campus has this problem I counted 5 of them on the wall right next to me the last time I ate here and usually I have to swat them away several times while I eat Not a major problem for some but its an issue for meI love the tofu burritos here and the bubble tea is pretty solid The burritos include sweet and spicy tofu cilantro optional rice cheese lettuce and other veggies Personally I think the flavor combinations is great and the burrito is huge so I always get two meals out of it My friends and I have all had good experiences with the KoreanMexican fusion dishes Ive heard mixed reviews of the other items including the bibimbap but Im not an expert on Korean food so Im not factoring that into this review I like the space and decorations in Spoon House However it is slightly pricier than other establishments on Green Street and Ive had experiences where my food can take a bit longer than I would expectI walked by their poster advertising Taco Tuesday and Thursday and being curious about Asian fusion food I decided to buy someon a Wednesday I was kind of hoping the regular price was worth it but I was disappointed By no means did they taste bad but they werent great either I was kind of irked by the sogginess It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the taco like eating a moist sponge I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos The beef was okay but didnt have much flavor besides being spicy The chicken was a bit dry but despite that it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy Im not a pro on Korean food but I think KBowl and Arirang do it better along with better pricingportions"

    "review":"The food is fairly average its not that great But overall would not recommend to eat with families or close friends Maybe for a quick lunch or dinner The owner is very nice and the place is fairly cleanIt depends what dish you ordered I personally recommend soup18 budaejigae And the fried fish is also good But it just takes a long time for your order if you dine in at the peak timeThere are many Korean restaurants on campus that are readily accessible for students at UIUC The market itself is a war zone With that said each and every one of those would try to have their specialty to outdo the others ARiRang in my opinion does stand out compare to its competitors in its own unique way In my personal opinion I find ARiRang to be much cleaner than its competitors Furthermore the layout of the tables were done in such a way that it would not block incoming traffic which if you are a regular at Woorijib would probably understand what I mean Every day there is always a lunch special going on And it is most definitely worth every penny For approximately 78 dollars you would get a bowl of rice a fish and a soup of choice Now this may not sound like a lot but the soup that comes with it is more like a stew I always get the Soondobu jigae forgive me if I spelled it right In English Tofu Stew It is a LOT more filling than you think if you never had it before Trust me on this If there is anything you really need to know about ARiRang is that their stewsoup food items are superior than their competitors Therefore if you are not sure what you want to get if you stick with this guideline you really cant go wrongWith reasonable price and delicious food I would highly recommend this place to anyoneI adore the budaejigae here If you must order something get that For those who dont know what it is its basically ramen mixed with sausage pork belly spam dumplings and vegetables You can also choose the level of spiciness of the broth For the typical broke college student the prices are low compared to other places on campus and they give you a lot of food all for under 10 If I had to rate the budaejigae Id give it five stars based on taste and the sides offered along with it Also there was so much I had to take home half in a boxIts true the owner isnt very talkative but thats due to a language barrier and its not fair to deduct any stars for that Theres also no waiter service but its a casual restaurant so this is to be expected Another thing to note is that its very clean compared to other places which is a nice touch Its not the best Korean food Ive had but its quite filling especially when youve got an urge to get Korean foodlike the Tofu soup and Kimchi fried rice Here lI tried out their Bibimbap and it was fairly average Not much else to say here Its your stand fare for around 10 if youre looking for Korean food to satiate your stomachs desires"

    "review":"We decided to take a trip off campus to downtown Urbana for a Friday night out after one of our favorite spots on campus was much too crowdedA friend has been to Bunnys before and suggested it might be a good option for a quieter cheaper night out The inside was nicer than I expected for a tavern so that was a pleasant surprise Lots of locals inside I think we were the only students there They have slot machines which I elected to try and lost 3They have a decent selection of bottled beer but only a few common ones on tap Guinness included so I was happy to be able to get one of thoseThe bartender seemed nice although I dont think he knew how to properly pour a Guinness Not a big dealI didnt feel that Bunnys was by any means inexpensive though at least for me Both of my beers were 450 my friends Jim Beam and coke was 350 The campus bars are probably cheaper though if youre really just looking to save Overall an AOK experience Id come back again and would like to try the foodI am a big fan of Bunnys It is right up my alley: cheaper than cheap beer fast and friendly service and surprisingly good food I envision this place as belonging on a desolate stretch of road in Wisconsin on the way to a lakeside resort If you have ever had the honor of visiting one of those hallowed establishments you will understand this to a compliment of the first orderTheir serving sizes are generous to say the least The grilled shark steak sandwiches are usually about 2x as large as the bun and an inch or more thick Their ribeyes are a steal for the 6 they charge and pitchers of domestic beer are usually below 10 They have grilled cheese sandwiches with soup for well under 5 and generous fried fish meals and sandwiches for about 5The decor is not much to talk about but if you get a seat in the right place you can read interesting articles about Bunnys from the past by famous UI grads Of course they have a bunch of beer signs TVs Megatouch games and all that Their bathrooms are better than one would expect Their outside patio is absolutely great in the summer and they will let you bring your appreciative dog who will steal french friesThe crowd is thankfully not a bunch of undergrads Please dont tell them about this placeVery good chili cheese dog especially the chili Service was ok for a Saturday afternoon I will come back and try some moreFirst i got some wings cause i am addicted to hot wings  They were not the very best i have had but they were good  The wings were nice and meaty with the right amount of sauce  My double bacon cheeseburger was very good but they were frozen patties just cooked on the grill  I got deep fried mushrooms instead of fries which were cooked very well but kind of small  The bloody gary was excellent but expensive for just one cause it had alot of ice in the glass  Its called a bloody gary because its garys recipe  The drink has beef broth in it which gives it a different taste  Overall i enjoyed the meal but kind of expensive  They need to clean up the outdoor eating area by remodeling some things but nice to have an area that bigDive right in Its my favorite dive in Urbana but since Gremer is gone its not quite the same Had to move westward to the other side of the tracks to see my favorite bartenderBest Lunch in Town  The Walleye on Fridays is awesome  The historical photos on the walls are cool too  And of course Guinness  What else do you need"

    "review":"If you like catfish get the fried catfish plate You wont be dissapointedGreat meal todayLilia was a great waitress alsohighly recommendDO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR  The manager I believe of indian or Syrian decent is one of the most prejudice individuals I have ever met in my entire life  His attitude is discussing  Please join me in boycotting this establishment  I will never ever eat here again  Nasty despicable place I will forever let any person who will listen to me know that this place is a throwback to Jim Crow daysIve always enjoyed coming to Cracker Barrel Recently I came here with my family and ordered the open faced Roast beef The roast beef was good but not amazing The mashed potatoes and gravy were really good and so was the toast that the beef and mashed potatoes were on I tried the cornbread and it was good but not great The service was pretty good and quickWe stop at the Cracker Barrel when we are traveling  It has a good variety of food and serves breakfast all day which is nice  No complaints about the quality of food and service here I like to stick to the catfish cod trout or salads and havent been disappointed yet  The wait can sometimes be long but once you are in they have enough staff to handle the crowds even when its packedOk since the last time I was at this Cracker Barrel on June 7th 2012  with its respective awful experience with of not getting a Rib Eye steak cooked to my liking  I tried several times over the course of two months following my last visit to register a complaint at the crackerbarrelcom feedback page  that  when submitting the feedback threw a web server 501 error likely meaning a programming or setup error malfunction on the server prevented the operation from finishing  Finally in August 2012 the 501 error was fixed and they received my feedback  albeit 2 months late  They promptly responded in snail mail a FREE 1 PERSON MEAL coupon to be used sometime before 1132013Well  today  Nov 24 2012 was the day I returned to Cracker Barrel to give them another chance at making a Rib Eye dinner for me  My girlfriend ordered a Meatloaf mealOur meals were  much much better at least mine was than last time  The Rib Eye was cooked to medium as I like  I could use a steak knife and cut it rather easily  It had good flavor  I also had cornbread muffins and a baked potato with butter  Cornbread muffins always tend to be a little dry and tend to clump in the back of my throat Usually I need a drink handy to wash it down as it clumpsMy girlfriend really like the meatloaf meal she ordered  Thought it was a good change from what she considered to be normal  It was quite tasty and the vegetables she selected were also very goodThe only chink in the armor of my meal was the baked potato  It was very very well cooked or nuked not sure if they use a confection oven or a microwave oven with the ends of the meat of the potato being very hard like an over nuked or over baked potato gets and the skin which I do eat was extremely tough  When I asked the server for a new potato I said the potatos skin cuts like leather When coming to that conclusion it took quite a bit of downward force on the knife to cut through the potato  A baked potato shouldnt offer so much resistance to being cutAfter the server replaced the potato the replacement was absolutely fine No problemsThe only other chink was service  Service wasnt spectacular Generally I give servers a standing rule that if they see my drink nearing or beyond half full bring another without asking me  Eventually Ill slow down and on my last drink itll take a long time for me to get down to the halfway mark  This particular server had a hard time keeping me well lubricated with my Coca Cola There were many times I waited for the next Coke to arrive for a few minutesIn general this visit to Cracker Barrel was somewhere near average  Not great Not awful  Had my first baked potato been edible an the server kept me sufficiently lubricated with a constant flow of Coke  theyd have received 4 stars  Because it didnt  this was a great improvement over the last time  but didnt WOW me3 stars"

    "review":"I had not been here in almost 15 years so when the family and I were out looking for someplace different to eat we decided to give Urbana Garden a try  Since the last time I was here the outside has been renovated quite a bit but the inside is almost exactly the same  It appeared to be reasonably clean but it is very dated looking  They have a HUGE menu which was a drawing card even 15 years ago when I was last hereWe were there on a Friday night when they have a AYCE Walleye special fish side soup or 1trip salad which is what I ended up getting  There was a small salad bar at the front but it didnt look too appetizing so I chose soup  The choices were broccoli cheese or clam chowder  I chose clam chowder as did one other  and the other two in our party chose broccoli cheese  One of the broccoli cheese soups had a single piece of broccoli in it that  I am not joking now  took up more than half the size of the cup   The clam chowder was nearly inedible  It was basically a really bland cream of potato soup that was gritty sludge and had no clams in it that I could taste at allOrders: AYCE Walleye special  fries Monte Cristo sandwich  fries 2x Bacon cheeseburger  friesThe Monte Cristo was not fried crisp at all which meant the bread was soggy but the meat in the sandwich tasted good  Thats a shame because the whole point of the Monte Cristo is the toast  The burgers were average at best and thats about what was expected  The fries were just barely warm all around  The fish was good but was VERY greasy and I was only able to eat a couple extra pieces on top of the original portionI think they would probably be good for big groups since they have large dining areas that can accomodate multiple tables put together  I just couldnt get past the glaring issues with the soups and food quality issues   Sorry but we wont be coming back   At that price point there are too many other better options out thereGot in for breakfast before the sun rose on Homecoming weekend Friendly staff and super quick service Ordered biscuits and gravy with home fries and 2 eggs scrambled It was hot and tasty  Only thing preventing 5 stars is the coffee It was weak Probably Maxwell HouseReally nice waitress but they really need to up the ante on their vegetarian options They dont even have a plain marinara sauce option for spaghettiMeh is about right  The service was good  The main reason we picked this restaurant for a large group about 20 people was because of the AllYouCanEat ribs special which several people ordered Only after we placed our orders turns out they had run out of ribs  They also refused to substitute the pork ribs for the beef ribs which was very disappointing  Salad bar was OK  The broiled salmon was really good  Probably would try a different place the next time we visitLot of food if volume is your criteria this is the place  Good food no sort of like I remember army food  Cabbage roll was way too salty  Rack of ribs too fattyStopped for a quick breakfast and found that here Great pancakes and fast pleasant service"

    "review":"I avoided Penn Station for the longest time based solely on the premise that CU did not need another sandwich chain Let me just say that was a BIG mistake Ive drop kicked Subway out of my rotation and replaced it with Penn Station Granted Ive never gotten beyond the Italian so many yummy flavors you just cant beet the uniqueness of PS And the fresh french fries and lemon aid are terrific The staff at this location are always friendly too Give em a tryHad my first visit to Penn Station  Im always skeptical when places like this advertise East Coast anything be it subs pizza whatever as I am Brooklyn born and raised  Their resemblence to any East Coast fare is usually pure hype  I ordered the Italian sausage with onions and peppers and a small fries  The sub was quite good  Very tasty  The fries were fresh and above fast food standards  Offering little packets of malt vinegar for the fries was a nice touch  Service was relatively quick and friendly  I give it three stars rather than four because four stars says that Im a fan  Much as I enjoyed my first experience there Im not a fan just a satisfied customer  East Coast  Well the sub I had though good  was certainly not up to the standards of a Sausage HERO in Little ItalyI love Penn Station the food is always hot and the fresh cut fries and fresh squeezed lemonade are amazing If its your first time eat in I find the fries dont retain heat very well and are usually cold after getting home and youre going to want more lemonade I far prefer this far over Subway or Potbellies if Im going for a hot sandwichThe chicken parmesan is the bombbb Hot fresh gooey cheese mmm Friendly service tooToasted sandwiches are the way to go Such it Subway The Philly cheese steak and chicken Teriyaki were my favorites The fries were pretty goodWhats up with the greasesoaked sandwiches here I came in here on a moderately busy Sunday night and ordered a 8 parmesean chicken sandwich expecting it to be any regular sandwich that I buy a campustown eatery but my goodness this was probably the most awful sub I have ever eaten After mindnumbingly slow service from payment to sandwich was 15 minutes a visually appetizing sub came out with chicken mushrooms onions topped with a layer of melted cheese As I grab the sandwich the middle just starts dripping everywhere and by the third bite the bottom just falls apart The rest of the meal was just a struggle to get the greasy concoction back between the slices of bread I guess the food tasted alright but it just takes away from the experience when you have a mess of food dribbling all over your hands I come here to get a sandwich for a reason because its easy and quick to eat The fries too were just terrible I dont think I even tasted any potato inside of the fried exterior They were hard bland and unappealing Perhaps this was just an offday for them Ive had better at other Penn Station locations"

    "review":"Solidly excellent siquan cuisine A little bit pricey but worth it if one is looking for authentic dishes from Western China On the minus side while their dim sum tastes excellent the portion sizes to price ratio and overall selection are smallStick to their specialty authentic siquan cuisine for best resultsBeen here twice a week before a belated grand opening and during the grand openingApparently this restaurant is positioning itself a bit more like a fine dining options than other restaurants in this town However the quality of service is not following the price and napkins They simply wont come to your table During the grand opening week we waited for about 50 minutes for them to take order reask the server to bring the drinks we asked for and finally get the first dish of foodOn the other hand I liked their food But the thing is that the virtue I found in their plates was more about its blandness in a good way I was expecting an extreme spiciness from the name Szechuan ChinaHowever I really should say that I liked their spicy fish and tofu dish before I finish I would visit this restaurant again for that single dishSzechuan China easily has the best Chinese food Ive eaten in CU but theyre lacking in consistency 35 stars if I couldFirst the bad: Ive been here five times with friends and each time one of the dishes we order comes out looking like garbage tasting extremely bland or both Once it was the spicy string bean sijidou which had no flavor at all Just today the fine shred potato with spicy capsicum tudousi I ordered came out gray Im just so confused  how do you stir fry potatoes and make them gray Ive ordered the same exact dish before and the potatoes were a beautiful shade of goldAll of that said though the food here is great when the chefs are onpoint The mapo tofu ox tongue eggplant dishes and twice cooked pork are all authentic and tasty Sichuan staples Its on par with the stuff Ive eaten back in Los Angeles and approved by my friend from Sichuan And really the proof is in this places popularity with the Chinese crowd Even on a random Wednesday night the place is packed with Chinese families waiting to get a taste of SichuanPS Im Chinese This means I get tons of advantages over other reviewers: I dont make the mistake of ordering one dish for myself and not eating family style ie dishes are supposed to balance each other out not dominate your mouth with one flavor for an hour I know what Im getting before it comes to the table and what it should taste like I know not to order off the American menu Its disappointing to see that things like these fuel bad reviews when its a culture clash rather than a food issueI give them 4 star because they make big changes i been this restaurant 3 times first time they just open was ok service was very busy every body run around its so funny food was salty  2nd time I was there 1weeks ago food make much betterand servers are good  nice to taking care my table today every was ok  they only have 5 tables so no body kind funny running around and I like they free cool dish before you order from menu we still get free cup of sweet dessert its very nice for all customers I think they can make better  So Its actual Chinese food not American Chinese food and not as varied as Golden Harbor and of a slightly different style  The quality of the food is really quite high and everything we ordered was very good  I find it comparable to some of Boston Chinatowns best having spent lots of time there thats my benchmark  Their black jasmine tea is that excellent classic tea that can only be found at good Chinese restaurants and when I asked they were happy to sell me a pint of tea leaves  They do a dim sum daily from 114 pm which we did along with a few other dishes  The dandan noodles were some of the best weve hadspicy but not too spicy and a bit sweet and the texture of the noodles were perfect  The wonton soup broth had clearly been made from scratch and the wontons were delicious as were the shumai and shrimp dumplings  Edamame was perfectly cooked and not oversalted The only dish we didnt love was the pork bun  It was tasty and wellmade but the pork inside was not the char siu barbeque that we expected or wanted  Im happy this place openeddespite looking on the outside like standard American Chinese fare it really isnt  Its some of the best Chinese food in the Chambana areaAmazing food I love eating here The food tastes authentic I love the dry braised dishes so yummy"

    "review":"The service is bad that lady dont even know what a spinach is and she doesnt want to serve us all she does is sit at the counter and watch her Korean drama The food taste worst and its over expensive I rather make it at home and buy and ingredients Im sure it will be cheaperMy husband and I opted for this restaurant for lunch My husband ordered the herbal broth I ordered the spicy broth at the spiciest level The spice was disappointing I was expecting it to be much spicier than it was The sesame sauce was tasty It was pricey for what we ordered but we still enjoyed ourselvesThe best hot pot in UrbanaChampaign area Been there with friends last night It was really awesomeI am 100 Chinese so I am qualified to review this place as the Most Authentic hot pot restaurant in town All the food here are up to the standard of authentic like those I taste in China not mentioned fresh and clean All the other restaurants in town offer hot pot could not provide food up to this standard Based on my personal experiences I like the tomato soup base It brings up the flavor in vegetables Bonus points for the soup tastes after cooking all the meat in there Hot pot sausage is another dish you must try The mini eggs taste incredible juicy after cooking in the broth and the egg yolk is very tasteful I dont eat lamb personally but my friends like it a lot For the dinning environment I would say it is good for family nice for a date and fun for group hang outs It totally worths for the money you pay for Servers here are very nice and the manager keep checking on us make sure we had a good time Anyway I would say Hot Pot Lab is a fun experience It would be a good place to treat yourself :My sister and I went here for lunch We were the only people in the restaurant which was fine The food came quickly and was very tasty The meats are high quality This restaurant is on the pricier side but worth it if you are really craving hot pot Only downside was that the server was very distant and barely said a word to us We had to hunt her down near the kitchen to order more food Otherwise I would definitely go back since the food was really goodThe food was delicious My husband and I each got the beef combo It was a lot of food and definitely worth the price After reading other reviews we were expecting it to be super expensive It ended up being less than 40 for both of us and that included beer  I cant wait to bring others here Its a fun experience with great food"

    "review":"Jarlings neighborI rated this 5 stars for their great service and food  The service at Yellowfin is really exceptional and in my opinion its among the best in service in ChampaignUrbana  As part of their exceptional service Yellowfin offers complimentary tastings of one of their appetizers last night we tried a seafood tortilla and the time before we had pumpkin soup and they also give a complimentary dessert a small serving of asian bananas foster with orange slices  We have consistently had excellent service and great food here and are looking forward to going back soonOn my second trip to Champaign in recent weeks I decided to stop by the other highly reviewed sushi spot in town   Yellowfin is on the edge of the University of Illinois campus athletic side and they serve solid rolls for being in the middle of Illinois  Among the selections the deep fried lobster roll was probably my favorite and you really need to try the seafood pancakes which is technically more Korean than Japanese  but if they are well prepared  who cares   The rest of the rolls were pretty routine but I agree with other reviewers that Sushi Kame is still the go to place when youre visiting this small but well fed college townBest place for sushi in ChampaignQuaint atmosphere good food decent price Very likeable service friendly waiters free complimentary dessert if you come for dinner occasionally :I went to yellowfin restaurant for the first time today I thought of giving yellowfin a shot as I keep on passing it while I drive so I wanted to try food there for a long time and today we managed to go and have some good and relaxing time there We went in and the server was very cheerful She quickly sat us to our table There was two more table in the entire restaurant but the server some how seem to be very busy There was only one server maybe because its a slow Tuesday lunch but both the tables had their food already served but still the server was just running here and there I dont know why  After 10 minutes she came to our table and asked for drinks We ordered a large Kirin beer and we ordered 2 gyoza 2 orders of yakidori and spicy tuna tempura appetizer Our gyoza came in which was just ok nothing very special We were excited about our yakidori but when it came out it was very disappointing too  We waited for our last  appetizer spicy tuna tempura for almost half an hour But when it came out it was distasteful no presentation at all there was almost no spicy tuna and was filled up with just cream cheese in jalapeo base I was very upset more than that we ordered a spicy chicken bento which we didnt even eat anything except for edamame that comes in it and the Illini roll and Champaign roll  and two spicy tuna hand roll which was as disgusting it was very distasteful and presentation was zero We just ordered another round of beer and none of us ate anything except drinking beer We just munched a bite and we were done with that horrible food I am very much Surprised that the business is still running Their sushi and food sucks and so is the sauce they put one every sushi rolls They are all very sweet and unpleasant We spent almost 120  for lunch there and left vey disappointing never to go back ever again Worst food  worst sushi  Worst presentation for expensive price Save money and eat somewhere else Dont even think of giving this restaurant a shot If u do just order one item at a time and try it first you will know if you want to order more or not Dont order everything together and be disappointed like usIf you like sushi you should eat here The place is the best price I have ever seen and the sushi is so very good  Cute little family owned place not much from the outside but very cute on the inside The staff is always attentive and friendly"

    "review":"They use fresh materials for all of their dishes The spicy stir fry  is especially good compared to other places in ChampaignUrbana area If you like spicy Chinese food you should come The one thing that I dont like about this place is that the wait time is always long during lunch timeI ordered the spicy stir fry The lady at the counter didnt speak much English but nonetheless was very nice and the owner told me that they do not use MSG a rarity for any Chinese restaurant My food arrived in a cute black pot with a plate of white rice However my rice was ice cold and the stir fry was lukewarm While the stir frys flavor was good the vegetables were undercooked This place could do very well they just need to cook the food through and serve it hotThis is quite an excellent Chinese soup place Overall I give it 35 stars when compared to food everywhere and 4 stars for a place on campus town The concept is essentially pick your own ingredients and soup stock and they make a single serving of personalized hot pot for you They have nonspicy fish stock for you people with cats tonguesI was craving some warm and spicy food in this cold Illinois winter So my boyfriend and I went to Spicy Tang for the first time and the food was way beyond our expectations Since I was starving I got both the Hot Pot and the Spicy Stir Fried  There was a variety of veggies and meat available for us to choose from and the ingredients were all very fresh We had a medium hot pot with tonkotsu broth The food was decent The sesame sauce was the best part of the Hot potI love the Spicy Stir Fried even more Id say it definitely tasted much better than what we had in EVO and is probably the best spicy stir fried on campus It was authentic delicious and just the right amount of spicy I will definitely come back for more of that Nom Nom NomThe service was also wonderful With the cashiers help it was easy for us to figure out what to order the first time we went We didnt wait long to get our food either All in all it was a wonderful and satisfying experience for us and the price was decent Keep it up Spicy TangFor those who want a quick review: I liked what I got the beef and noodle soup and Ill most likely come back at least once moreFor those who want more detail in a review: I came here on a whim to try something new I got a tiny bit anxious when I saw no menu displayed anywhere but the staff at the counter was kind and gave a small brochure menu that had  pictures on it of the premade orders you could also make your own  cost was determined by how many items you put in it and gave me his recommended item  the beef and noodle soup Since I had no preconceived idea of what I wanted and I figured something basic would tell me a decent amount about their food quality and preparation I decided to order just thatIt didnt take that long for the soup to arrive but it wasnt that busy when I had ordered though a decent amount of people came in after me not too many that it got crowded but enough to tell me that this wasnt a place that got few customers But I digress The presentation was kind of unique  it came in a black potkettle with chopsticks a fork for those not comfortable with the chopsticks and what I think is a broth spoon  I thought it tasted quite good by itself I added some spicy taro to it and I liked it better that way but thats a personal preference I finished it all full and satisfied Admittedly it was a bit more than I would have liked to pay 940 is what I paid but I had a good enough time and enjoyed what I had that I can deal with it When I come back again Ill try one of the custom dishes and see if thats any good and if I remember update this review"

    "review":"This is the real deal  a little Italy in itself  Dimly lit checkered tablecloths comfortable booths and Chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling  Romantic a popular Valentines Day destination  One of our favorite places in Champaign  I love the chicken capperi  the wine sauce is incredibly delicious  Nice service  Save room for dessertShort review Ive been going here since I could drive when this was one of the few games in town that served only Italian Unfortunately nothing has changed since the good old days and I feel there are some definitely in need We were greeted with the typical tepid response from mama Manzella once she realized we were there and taken to our table with little more than a word offered My wife an I ordered our meals veal parm for me and fettuccini alfredo for her The salad that came with our entrees were swimming in water I can assume it wasnt the dressing that was that watery that they apparently forgot to wring out of the lettuce There were a few raw onion rings and a roma tomato slice or two scattered on top of of a haphazardly put together bed of iceberg lettuce The entrees came with little fanfare my wife reported that her alfredo was on the low end of quality from what she has had in other establishments and my veal was tough and smothered in cheese which pretty much masked any other flavor lying beneath it The spaghettini that I got as a side seemed to be covered in some sort of jarred sauce Prego Ragu There was tons of pasta on the side more than I could ever consider finishing and the veal was borderline too much I would think with the prices they charge they could up the quality and cut on the portions and make it a trade off monetarily  All in all I dont know what we will ever go back I really want to like this place and I would REALLY like to support a local town staple but Im not going to pay good money for that Sometimes its good to reinvent oneself and their quality and menu could use a big makeover I am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to returnRestaurant hasnt changed in more than thirty years and is very dated The food is generally good and service is averageHad lunch there on a rainy day The light was dark so I did not enjoy eating there The food was just soso No much choice on the menu Dont know if they had another menu for dinnerThis place is ahh mazing The boy Eddie that works there is so sweet and nice and cute He washes the dishes but told me that he doesnt wash his hands so Only four starsGet the Italian beef sandwiches"

    "review":"My opinion of this place has improved since first moving to Urbana Their espresso drinks are high quality and they have an excellent selection of teas and pastries Also their sandwiches are really good Make sure to try their oatmeal cookiesI have to update my review for this  The last few times I went to Paradiso I ordered my usual cappuccino  It was bad to the point where I could probably do better making it at home the foam wasnt smooth or well integrated with the rest of the drink  It was pretty much plopped on top and had the consistency of dish bubbles which is not what you want when youre making a cappuccino  Id probably give Paradiso a 25 if I could because the sandwich i got there was pretty good  But I was just so so disappointed by the cappuccino quality that I cant give it a 3Espresso rocks Coffee is so good Food is over priced a bit but still great The space is a bit 90s Overall I would drive quite a way to get coffee here I am a huge fan of Intelligentsia I felt their espresso was represnted really quite wellGod Id give them a 5 if they werent so ungodly expensive Im a student and 2 dollars for a cup of coffee is just too high Also why is an iced americano 50 more than a hot one 330 GAH I really wish I could afford it but I cantParadiso makes great stuff Great Americanos great lattes even with latte art woohoo who knew it existed in ChampaignUrbana etc Their environment is also great Its absolutely what a coffee house should be laid back and busting with cultureI dont know what else to say Theyre great but too expensive Im going to go broke if I pay for that everyday I have to pay for rent and food and thingsIts hard to evaluate the merits of a coffee shop based on a french soda but this place seems pretty good It cost about 3 which is a bit pricey but tasted good and the syrups they use are good qualityId have to keep going here and grab a coffee to see how the place is on the wholeMy absolute favorite place to get a cup of coffee as they serve Intelligentsia and they usually brew it up strong  Good sandwiches too  I think Tuesday and Thursday they have an Italian beef on the menu  Not made strictly traditional but an awesome version nonetheless  The only downside is that their brewed coffee is noticeably more expensive than Espresso Royale or Starbucks so I usually visit Paradiso to treat myself"

    "review":"I ordered salmon avocado roll with spicy mayo on the SIDE and instead got my sushi COMPLETELY smothered with a bucket of gross watery spicy mayo Pretty much paid 14 bucks for inedible soggy sushiWell we tried to come here Yelp said they were open We drove there and it was closed They have new summer hours I forget what they are thoughAnyways call to see if its open before you goI guess well try it next timeIm intrigued by the menu some of the rolls sound like stuff I cant find anywhere else if you know a place let me know The lava roll sounds great so does the cali crunch Cant wait to try itThis place is alright Ive ordered sushi udon and takoyaki from here Its a bit pricey but not very remarkable This is one of those trendy Asian food places that pop up here and there but they might be pushed out of business with places like Sakanaya or Sushi Kame Sushi Rock has a nice clean environment with hip decorations and a kpopjpop mix going on in the backgroundThe sushi is alright but nothing really special Its better than Sushi Ichiban no doubt but compared to other sushi joints the price isnt worth it The udon is nice and the broth is warming so I would recommend that Mine came with vegetable and shrimp tempura which were delicious My only complaint with dining in is that the service while friendly can be a bit forgetful and you have to remind them you need water or your bill so they know youre thereThe takoyaki was awful and a total ripoff though I was picking up a snack between classes and paid a little over 4 for four lukewarm shriveled up ping pong balls covered in sauce and a little bit of green onion They were soggy and the little octopus bit was chewy like a wad of gum and tasted bland Im pretty sure theyre the frozen kind you buy at Asian markets and you can buy a large bag to microwave at home for a better priceOf course its conveniently located on Green Street so its close to campus and convenient for hungry students who would rather forego the even more overpriced and poor quality of Sushi San in the Union basementDO NOT EAT HERE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Dont walk away from this place RUN Not only is the food VERY mediocre it is also over priced I will never eat here again and waste my money and timeOne of the nicest and clean places on campus The food is pretty good although they couldve serve more food The bento boxes particularly kimchi pork is pretty good I would recommend that dish then any udongs Overall not a bad place to try Japanese  Korean foodPricy and sushi taste pretty plain"
