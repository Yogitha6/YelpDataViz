    "review":"Good lamb shaorma wrap According to my hostel I was supposed to get a discount but the cashier didnt have a specific discount in mind He offered to lower the price by 80p bringing the order to 5 That always seemed sketchy to me but I accepted After he made it he couldnt remember what he told me before or what I was paying him a 10 note Luckily this didnt cause any conflicts but I was still on edge Plus the whole place seemed rundown and dirty Funny how a place so close to Grassmarket tourism can be so sketchy Not recommended for sitin after dark and I probably wont be returningFleshmarket Close can get a bit hairy during weekend evenings Its littered with broken bottles and the notorious alcove near the top is given over to chancers brandishing cans of Kestrel which leads to streams of unidentifiable liquid pouring down the steps Its not pretty Such a realists slice of afterhours life requires a grubby kebab shop to complete the picture and thats where Yum Yum comes in It not donner at the level of Palmyra but still a good bit better than some of the stinking offal youll find peddled at 3am elsewhere The usual burgers and pizzas round off a pretty competent option for a latenight nosh up"

    "review":"Tucked away at the back of the train station the Nor Loch is a good way to pass some time if youre a bit too early for a train or in my case lateIt doesnt really have a personality but thats to be expected since its main pull of customers are commuters As Ive said of train station bars before I quite like the anonymity of sitting in a place like this where youre unlikely to bump into someone you know You can usuaslly grab a paper and a pint and go undisturbedThey serve up some pretty standard food and drinks prices are reasonable Its decked out like an old man bar so its got a cosy facade Theres not that much behind it but then there doesnt need to be If youre wanting somewhere to meet a friend before you catch the last train home this bar is a perfectly nice venue to do so They also serve up tea and cake if youre that way inclinedWildly overpriced so if youre planning on drinking here Id kindly suggest that you spend your money at an off licence and drink on the trainl stopped here with my better looking half for a quick drink and maybe a bit to eat before we began our little day out to North BerwickThe signboard outside showed 2 offers One being a sandwich  a drink for 5 The other offer was for a pie  a pint for 480 l opted for the piepint combo as l felt like giving myself some extra man points The plans were quickly scuppered as the cook who was lacking in any sort of apronpinnie told me there was no pies so I opted for the sandwich  drink then to find out that it was for a hot drink or small soft drink I also overheard the barmaid ask a gent for 8 for 2 bottles of beer which gave me a bit of a frightOverall quite misleading in my personal opinion The sandwich was pretty good Nice bread nice ham and cheese Nothing that can go wrong which is good and the coffee was fairly nice for a train stationpub coffeeI do wish that I had seen the toilets before sitting down to my sandwich though which had a can of Stella that never made it back out again with a questionable puddle that didnt quite make it to the toilet bowlSorry Nor Loch you tempted me in with your almost classic looking decor but unfortunately that was all you hadStation bar at Edinburgh Waverley railway station named after the loch which used to be located where the station now sitsPretty much a bogstandard bar modern with no atmosphere Also rather overpriced but that is to be expected Screen available and seating available outside in the main booking hallNot my sort of place Im afraidConsidering that the Nor Loch caters to commuters who have a long delay for thier train or are tanking up before getting on a train to somewhere for a stag do  this place isnt badYes being in the middle of a train station may seem like it would propose problems for a pub  but actually this place does very well out of being here It is always full being the only pub in the station it can cater for families so dont expect it to be a hardcore drinking den it serves food which isnt bad and its not to shabby looking eitherHowever it is on the expensive side and generally always full of stag dos But really this place should be worse but somehow it isntNamed after a medieval Edinburgh loch that the plagueridden residents of yesteryear used as a dump for their buckets of shit piss and vomit  The Nor Loch is surprisingly alright for a station pubDont get me wrong theres nothing good about it but knowing it was a station pub I expected it to have all the charm and atmosphere of the stagnant body of filthy sewage water its named after It doesnt have much more admittedly but wasnt as depressing as I expected it to beUsual story middle of the road beers a few cheap plonks and food I wouldnt give to the dog Just as you expectIn retrospect I wish wed just bought a few cans in the shop and drank them on the trainIt was full of wasted folk who I suspect werent waiting on trains was reasonably dingy and was just generally the kind of place where you drink up quickly because you just want to get away from the clientele"

    "review":"Wonderful big old converted stable with a log fire in winter Excellent bar food and good banter from staff Love itNice bar tucked away from the masses  busy with walkers and people after a good quality meal Food is generally good with big portions  serves variety of wines as well as good choice of beers etc Safe place for families as bar is in a courtyard area Look out for the hairy spiders which appear now and thenGreat food and attentive service in a great atmosphere We had the 2 12 portion size Haddock and chips for 10 and a Mac and cheese The serving size for the 12 portions were very adequate I would hate to see what the full size looks like Service was very friendly and we were checked in on during the meal to ask how our meal was The restaurant has dark ceilings plaid booths and a big fireplace Stone walls throughout give a great pub feel and super warm and cozy feel The building is a converted stable and is a brilliant spotWhen The Man and I moved to our new house we were a bit bummed to note that there didnt seem to be any good locals in our area  One day on the bus however I noticed a big Deuchars sign saying Stable Bar next leftSo one evening when we were visiting the incredibly awesome garden center we decided to head down the lane to see what this place was likeI think its important to say that within minutes of leaving the main road you feel like youre in the countryside  Seriously all you see are the hills and various sign postings for local walks  THEN you pass the Highland Coos  Seriously there is a field with two coos in it on the way to the pub  How cool is that  When you get to the pub itself you see rabbits exploring all around you and horses in the field next to it  Its probably important to mention that I live IN Edinburgh not in some random rural place where this would all make sense  The pub itself is in a beautiful old building with a very large beer garden out front  It was ideal for that one balmy evening we had a while back  We headed in to get a couple of pints to enjoy as we sat outside and were greeted by the quintessentially cheekygruff bartender who had quite the twinkle in his eye and and was SO up for a laugh  The waitress was also very friendly efficient and good for a laugh  Our food was completely standard pub fare  My fish and chips were good but not excellent as was The Mans dish  But you dont exactly go to the Stable Bar expecting a gourmet meal just something to fill your belly while you enjoy a good pint in attractive surroundings  In addition to the large beer garden the pub boasts a large fireplace which must make it wonderfully cozy in the winter  Ill report back when I knowThe Stable Bar is under new management which has some pros and some consPros:The beer selection has been modernised and changes regularly as a result As a beer fan I enjoy the changing optionsThe menu has gotten an overhaul and the food has improved tremendously Its not exceptional but I would have no problems coming here for a meal while previously it was pretty abysmalThe smoky log fire has been replaced by a wood burning stoveCons:Theyre trying to give it a bit of an odd makeover which isnt working Tungsten light bulbs are meeting pastel paints and tartan and it feels cheap and forced Aforementioned wood burner is on even when its warm which makes the place sweltering There doesnt seem to be adequate extraction from the kitchen as you could see the haze hanging in the back roomThe new staff are nice but just arent a patch on Forbes and his bartenders There is nothing personal and no special cheek anymore They also seem to have gotten rid of the rubber spiders which were hidden in the rafters and dropped onto tables for the delight of nearby children There was nothing better than the screams and laughter brought about by those so its such a shame theyre goneA bit of the spirit of this place is gone which is a real shameBack up againThe Stable Bar has hit its stride Good staff a great rotation of beers local and not and food which I would be happy to receive in any bar in towo let alone out in the sticks as we are Its grapeat to have somewhere child friendly where we can get nibbles and refreshment They have recently put in a TV which is treated perfectly as its only on for big events rather than showing rubbish all the timeReally pleased with the Stable Bar as it is now"

    "review":"I really like this Pizza Express and I always take advantage of their 2 for 1 offers on the website or the back of cinema tickets Service is swift and the food is consistant The large windows give a nice view of the water and bustle at the Leith shore There are lots of healthy options on the menu as well decent veggie optionsPizza Express is a chain of restaurants that somehow never actually feels like a chain  I attribute this to their unerring instinct for picking fabulous and interesting locations for their branches lending them a touch of class and preventing them from ever seeming genericThis one on the Shore is no exception to this rule as it rubs shoulders with Michelinstarred restaurants on the same street catering to customers who are keen to enjoy the ambience of the Waters of Leith lapping outside the front door but are unwilling to pay 100 for their dinnerOf course the menu is the same everywhere but sometimes its reassuring to know what youre getting and at Pizza Express youre never really taking a gamble with the food as everything is pretty nice  In fact sometimes better than nice  last time I was here I had an awesome decadent dessert of stewed figs served with mascarpone and black coffee that was just about perfectI love pizza and by that I mean good pizza Not pizza like you get from pizza hut that also seems like the crust is somehow deep friedPizza Express is a chain yes but like I have said judge a place by what it sets out to do PE aims to deliver good pizza for the family at affordable prices but with an edge of qaulity about itSlick decor friendly staff nice menus all set a good tone Pizzas of every variety as well at the opportunity to add your own toppings makes me a happy manTake a margeritaadd some black olivesthrow on some anchovies and drizzle with chilli oil and you have my idea of heaven Nom nom nomThey have a very reasonable selection of Italian wines as well  most under 20 Desert range for me is where is goes a bit wrong  hate the lemon meringue tart  shop boughtfrozen rubbish  that accounts for their lost starPizza Expressdoes the jobReally good I dont know how to say this any better They have done away with the wood and rustic feel that was seriously outdated Instead they now have tables with Italian marble and Mediterranean stripe Soft mint green walls and a real open kitchen The offererings are same ol same ol and with the fresh interior and quality on offer it is still just as tasty  We ordered a mezze starter mix and a variety of Romana pizzas  and a gluten free one as well all this went down a treat and  yes  we bagged and tagged the leftovers The service was quick curteous and flexible I ordered an affagato  though not being on the menu they happily managed to serve us one For a chain this place is very very goodReally surprised by my experience here Yes it is Pizza Express but the make over with the modern dcor and pretty comfortable chairs then I was happy to dine here and what is more I really enjoyed itThe new gluten free options means that I had choice here and I thought the pizza was pretty yummy It is a standard base used  no options on size and thickness but it is thin and crispy with the right amount of crunch There are a good range of toppings available sadly no Sloppy Giuseppe and my la Reina was tasty and well covered with toppingsA nice addition is the mini bites with coffee Dessert is available but you can also get coffee with a range of mini desserts when you want something sweet but cant face a full dessert There is an option of a gluten free brownie and despite my brownie fatigue it was really good and just enough to round off a mealSo as Claire C has mentioned theres deals aplenty for Pizza Express so its worth checking before heading here but for tasty food good service and nice surroundings then it is worth a visit And for sunny nights the outdoor seating at The Shore is lovelya warm sunny evening had me off to meet up with the lovely nikki a for some pizza gossip and free prosecco from pizza express  now perhaps pizza express isnt the first place that comes to mind when thinking of where to go for a girly night out but it was hard to resist since they had sent me a voucher for a bottle of free prosecco for my birthday :wed booked a table outside but decided that it was getting a bit breezy so the waiter happily showed us a table inside  although there was only two of us he sat us at a table for four which was nice since we had a bit of extra space  he almost promptly brought the prosecco over so we could have a drink while looking over the menupizza express clearly does one thing well and that is pizza  we both went for the pandana leggera pizza while i started with the mozarella and tomato salad and my dining partner had the dough balls  although we were initially told that it could be up to 30 minutes for food our starters arrived fairly quickly  a mozarella and tomato salad is basic but i think what makes the pizza express version is their amazing pesto sauce drizzled around the side  i only wish there had been more of itpizzas arrived shortly after starters so i assume the kitchen wasnt as slow as they predicted  although the leggere version is smaller than the typical version i definitely didnt feel like i was missing out on anything  that pizza base was crisp and the goats cheese and carmalised onions made it delicious  i also felt sort of healthy with the salad in the middle of the pizza although that may have been cancelled out by the polenta fries nikki and i shared  as a side note the polenta fries are awesome and sharing food means that calories dont count we finished up with the mini desserts me opting for the brownie and a tea instead of the coffee  the brownie was incredibly good and indulgent but the perfect size as it was just big enough to really enjoy but small enough not to feel like i was overindulgingthe food was definitely good but i also have to make a point of saying that the service was really excellent  our prosecco glasses never went empty until sadly the bottle was finished the wait staff was super attentive making sure that our food was brought out promptly and any extras were brought out as well  also our waiter had a bit of witty banter with us which made it for a very fun eveningdefinitely enjoyed this pizza express and i know ill be back :"

    "review":"This is an excellent sandwich shop located on Leith Walk which serves delicious food with great service at decent prices  The shop is small light and quaint with friendly staff and an impressive semideli counter  They not only serve sandwiches hot and cold salads and baked potatoes but also flamegrilled burgers  I went for a large sausage and scrambled egg roll which somehow only came to 160 It was delicious with good quality sausages velvety scrambled eggs and and nice fluffy white bread  Id come here again any day and would urge you to do likewise as I couldnt fault the service food or menu and was staggered by the pricesThis place is cheap  and in a good way not in a way which is reflected by the staff and the foodThats because the food is awesome and the staff are really friendly There is a huge selection of the usual sandwich fillers that you would expect from a place like this but more importantly they also do amazing baked potatoes and various other foods which you mmay not have expected when you first walked into BitesAnd again back to the price  You could come in here with a 5 note and leave with change after a full meal AmazingBites is a really lovely place to stop by for a snackIts a small sandwich takeaway selling a nice selection of fillings including some deli options There are also a good selection of juice and nibbles in the fridge all at cheap prices but good cheap as Jonathan said They had some really nice coconut slices and the sweet eats such as the cake slices were quite massive in size but surprisingly well priced considering the portions What strikes me most of all about Bites is how lovely the staff are I dragged my feet into this wee shop on the hottest of days like week and felt like I was going to faint A bottle of water and a cake given to me by the lovely owner sorted me right out We had a chat about the weather and holidays Its nice when you visit a shop where the owner is genuinely interested in your custom He was very polite and since Id had a bit of a rough couple of weeks his chatty manner was just the right tonic to put me in a better moodWonderful service and nice food Id definitely go backYou cant really go wrong with  a place like this It is a cute little sandwich shop that offers everything from snacks to lunchesTheir food is good and quite reasonable As has been said before me there is a good selection of everything and the staff are happy to help Onto a winnerQute some way down what must surely be the greatest street in the world by location alone Im probably a bit biased towards Bites but nonetheless its a great stop for good honest food with just enough frills to make it more memorable than your average sarnie shopA BLT cake and a bottle of juice came to less than 4 notes on my visit and such a feast can often cost you not far off double that in Edinburghs more glamorous locales Next time Im down  this end Ill definitely be backI liked Bites very much The sandwich was fresh and tasty and their Indian potato and spinach soup offered a lovely combination of flavoursOverall we said: I was really pleased to have stumbled upon such a good little place as Bites proved to be At 410 for soup and roll its towards the cheaper end of the market but much like nearby Chequers and Crollas they have their low costhigh quality value proposition working very nicely Id be glad to pay it another visit and hope to do so soon"

    "review":"When the Yelp UK team get together there are a few things guaranteed 1 Fun 2 Loud chats and 3 Sushi Were a team of fish fanatics it seems and we tend to go out together to get ourselves some tasty Japanese eats whenever we can For the latest instalment of team UK fun we headed to Bentoya for lunch I actually really liked the decor of this place It wasnt super sophisticated but I really liked the star ceiling and the cute decor touches around the place Their Bento box lunch deal is AMAZING 750 for Miso and a choice of Bento which included a couple of starters I had a Sashimi Bento but ordered a cheeky helping of chicken Gyoza to start which to be fair I hadnt of needed to The Gyoza were excellent Flavourful soft and tasty  I am a sucker for Dim Sum and these were top rateThe fish used for the Sashimi was clearly very good quality and was fresh and delicious It came with the aforementioned Miso which was nice and a gyoza dumpling as well as some other bits and pieces My only complaint was that as everything is made to order  it can be a little slow to get the food but the quality was excellent I would recommend a trip to these guys for lunch but maybe not if youre in a hurry I would definitely check them out for dinner too as their prices were very affordable but the quality was above and beyondHaving read many positive reviews I was hoping to find a good Japanese restaurant Unfortunately my experience was quite terrible The place is a JapaneseChinese fusion restaurant which usually means Chinese chefs and substandard Japanese food This turned out to be the case The fish was flavourless and felt like it had just been defrosted To make everything worse the service was slow and forgetful I probably wont be going backIm upping Bentoya to 4 stars after my most recent visit Which was much improved Staff were just as commendable as on my first visit Very friendly attentive and super efficientI ordered the Miso soup Kimchi Eel Nigiri and the 3 Kinds of Sashimi 10 pieces I went for Tuna Salmon and Scallop Dishes were served super fast and all delicious The Kimchi was fresh crunchy and in a mild spicy sauce could have been a tad spicier I even shamelessly drank the sauce after finishing The Eel was really good perfectly cooked Succulent white flaky flesh Mildly fatty crispy skin and coated in a gorgeous sweet and earthy sauce The Sashimi was just as awesome The Salmon was very fresh and creamy The Tuna equally as fresh and almost meltinthemouth good The Scallop was again fresh Sweet firm and white without any hint of that out in the open a little too long taste that Scallops easily acquireIm so glad I went back and am able to update my review With my meal coming in at less than 20 Bentoya offers the best value for money Japanese food in town Hands downQuite cheap for the Edinburgh sushi scene790 for a vegetarian dinner bento just off Lothian road It is supposed to come with vegetable tempura gyozas avocado sushi rice and miso soup but I swapped the gyoza for cucumber sushi didnt want too much fried food I found the prices quite honest here and hopefully this place will help lower the price bar for sushi in Edinburgh as its usually quite overpricedTastewise not the best but reflects the priceThere are Chinese and Japanese options on the menu Service is reasonably fastWe were a group of 8 on a busy night so we did have the food delay problems that other reviewers mention but even that isnt going to sway me from giving Bentoya five stars The high quality of the food paired with the incredibly reasonable prices make this a standout sushi restaurant by Edinburgh standards I am already looking forward to my next visitOrdered chirashizushi and rice tea The raw fish ranged from very fresh salmon tuna scallop yummy to just not everything else The rice was not to my taste The tea is either low quality or has been sitting around for a very long time it was quite bland But the meal came with miso soup Its clearly a popular local place It gave me a quick and urgently wanted fix for Japanese at a weird time of the day and wasnt terrible value for money so it has four stars from me"

    "review":"Nice tartanbased interior design in here now Not a pub Ive managed to visit in any of its previous incarnations but the pints of Trade Winds we had were well kept and the general atmosphere was only let down by them playing one of those cover version cds like they do in BQ rather than the real thingSeen this place go through name changes and ownerships over the years I never really loved it as a place to hang out when it was an old mans pub then when it was given a refurbishment to become Beirex I think I liked it less Now I dont know what it is trying to be The food is expensive as is the beer and neither are particularly special  I dont have call to be here often and there are much better pubs within walking distanceMinus expensive food and drink that isnt that great weird use of space  some of staff seem bored and unfriendlyPositive isnt terrible just a little generic like a privately owned chain pub  some of the staff are greatYou know the story A voucher a midweek early meal a catchup with a friendI never expect less of a place when they have a voucher on In fact it should be the opposite  they should be showing off what they do best The voucher in question was a pottail between two and two burgers with fries each Easy peasyIm gonna launch straight into the food here as this is where I most let down I went for the venison add on black pudding and Emily H the beef burger add on blue cheese After a normal wee wait we got tucked in The slab of blue cheese was literally a huge slab and I had a whole round black pudding on top I could see that my venison burger had been made with wholegrain mustard as it showed throughout This should have lended itself to some tasty tasty burger However mine was really really dry Like really Not inedible not a bad taste per se But just dry And the chips were quite flavourless even with saltIts very very rare that I outright criticise food And like I said it wasnt bad I ate it all I was hungry and it was fine But when I know a few other places equally as closeby that do really really tasty burgers I dont see myself coming out of my way to No 1 Grange Road for burgers The staff themselves were really lovely and friendly Great banter If Im honest I was originally going to give 2 stars as I was so disappointed in the food but the super friendly staff pulled it back upThe bar itself has a nice wee layout with lots of booths around the window  perfect for a small group or intimate drink Its slightly off the beaten path too so depending on whether you like a quiet pint or the hustle and bustle of the Festivals it could be brilliant or a bit dullThe friendly staff would entice me back for a drink but I wont be trying the food again which is a shameIve been in here many a time because of its handy location and decent lunch deal Soup and a giant sandwich for a fiver gets my vote This place is never going to blow you away but its warm friendly and the food always arrives in good time Its never spectacular and I wouldnt come here for a dinner or proper meal but for a warm filling lunch I have always been happy I also wonder if the chef might be a smoker because the grub sometimes leans towards the salty sideStill a pleasant wee place that is unlikely to offend any of your senses Pop in if you need a quick lunch or want a pit stop for some chatFamily friendly funThis is possibly one of the most PG rated pubs in Newington Recently refurbed they have gone for a really Scottish vibe its quite cosy without being quaint The girls behind the bar were very friendly happy to chat which was welcoming as we were already half a dozen beers down the road The rest of the clientele werent as inebriated  but I was cool with thatDrinking with a childhood friend and his fianc wasnt at the time but is now congrats from Aberdeen we had settled into a noisy banter routine and our efforts to get others involved didnt go down too well All the other punters seemed like couples and they chortled every time i shouted something stupid at the football The guy in the Top Gun T shirt seemed to handle our banter well alsoWe had some nachos which were good not the best ever but fine for the price They had a decent back bar with some nice gins and also one local beer on the hand pump  but I opted for GuinnessGo here for a relaxing bite to eat or some non male dominated sports viewingthough there are better options in the areaFormerly Bierex Number 1 Grange Road hasnt changed much since the refurbishment essentially a paint job and a name change with a few minor changes to the menu This is a local bar to me though its usually to eat that I go there Its good pub grub with a few twists on the menu particularly the choice of nachos options theres classics with just salsaguacamole and sour cream chilli nachos adds beef chilli chicken nachos adds chicken and fried peppers then theres haggis or veggie haggis nachos both with whiskey sauce and steak strips too in the case of the standard haggis Also of note is the Sunday breakfast special two full Scottish breakfasts for a tenner so find a friend and its only a fiver each or wait till youre ravenous and go and have two the offer is on till 2pm on Sundays Im not sure how long itll run for though as its become quite popular"

    "review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer that when you are presented with seven hundred identical looking lunch time snacky sandwich places you get kinda sceptical that youll be able to differentiate your experience between them as they all merge into one ubiquitous blurHowever Fresh Cut is actually pretty decent Despite its modest exterior once inside you get the impression that every other sandwich joint has taken its style from this place as Fresh Cut just seems to be that bit more professional The small seating area looks cleaner smarter the boards advertising the food look better organised better presented As for the actual food well yeah its still a sand which place but it is better than most The first thing that struck me was the quality of the bread I had a baguette that used nice tasting wholemeal bread What a change from the cheap white crapAlso expect paninis wraps and baked potatoes as standards costing around 2350 depending on what you pick and how many fillings you choose to stuff your face withOverall the best of a mediocre bunchEdinburgh is a city with a proliferation of sandwich shops and most of them are not very good Fresh Cut is one of four yes four that sit next to each other on Lothian Road Id always given it a wide berth as from the outside it just looks like any other bog standard sandwich place selling uninspired food to hoardes of office workers I went there for some scran today though and was pleasantly surprised The ciabatta was still warm from the oven and there were lots of lovely fillings to choose from: I ended up going for chorizo goats cheese roasted red peppers and tomato chutney It set me back 350 but I was the envy of the office and nicely full for the rest of the afternoonI agree with the other 2 reviewers I work in the area and was crying out for consistency in taste and value when it came to lunchtime offerings and this place provides it Probably the cheapest coffee in the area tooand its Illy and goodAs i was made the Duchess at lunch time i thought i should probably review Fresh CutThis wee sandwich shop on Lothian Road is one of those consistent places that does exactly what it says on the tin Their menu is pretty big offering sandwiches paninis soup etc They have about 5 soups on their menu and unlike other places these soups dont change good for people who like having their set routine Today i had a bacon brie and cranberry panini and the mushroom soup both were delicious There have a decent amount of seating inside which is good for a bit of people watching on Lothian RoadThe staff are pleasant enough and the prices are pretty standard Not the most exciting review but i would recommend itIm a bit of a lunchtime snob and Lothian Rd is full of dodgy looking sandwich shops where you eye the congealed mayonnaise type fillings that clearly come from a cash and  carry and shiny ham suspiciously Id avoided this shop assuming like previous reviewers that it was just another one of those place that skimped on fresh ingredients Boy was I wrong Ive been in several times now and its one of my favourite lunch time takeaway places I love the soups 5 varieties available but Im a lentil soup all the way type of gal and salads where you can pick exactly what you want Everything looks fresh and tasty and they have choices such as mini pickled onions rocket hummus roast chicken goats cheese a variety of lettuce etc lots of things to make an interesting healthy  v tasty salad Yummy"

    "review":"The Mash Tun is a fantastic local to have were lucky that we only live round the corner from it literally its at the end of our street Its welcoming with a mixture of old man locals and a younger crowd plus the staff have always got a great selection of tunes onThe food is of a pretty high standard as pub grub goes The menu has changed slightly recently my favourite pizza has gone oh no but is still good quality There are lunch options sandwiches I recommend the fish goujons one like a fish finger sarnie but classy burgers pizzas and other standard fare like steak pie Plus daily specials You can get even more value for money if youre savvy enough to snap up one of their deals A burger and a beer for a tenner on Mondays 2for1 fajitas on Tuesday two steaks and a bottle of red and it was a really good steak on Thursdays and 2for1 pizzas when you buy two drinks all week Excellent During the summer they had Prosecco Fridays too but Id guess that as the weather turns that one will be wheeled back in the cupboard til next yearThe Mash Tun also often hosts tap takeovers by Leith locals Pilot Brewery theres one just now with a Meet the brewer event to kick each one off Plus a pub quiz league on a Wednesday and regular football matches on the big screenI wouldnt say that Id necessarily go out of my way to come here if I lived on the other side of Edinburgh but if youre in the Easter Road area and in need of a pint and a bite then make The Mash Tun your destinationWe picked up this place for watching the World Cup opening this year The place was pretty full we stood by the bar till a table was free Service was top notch there is an amazing variety of beers with some special ones written up on their blackboard we tried several different ones and enjoyed pretty much all of themUnfortunately when we decided to order something from the kitchen it was too late and closed but we went there in another day for watching another match and we all decided to order some pizzas they have a promotion when 2 pizzas are ordered you pay only half on the second one We LOVED it thin crispy crust lovelyMy favorite one was with spinach cheese and an egg in the middle everything with egg is better I think this one was called Fiorentina smtg like thatThe less favorite was the vegetarian haggis one it lacked on flavor compared to the other onesService was very good too great place to go for some nice beers and pizza with friendsWe were walking along the road in the middle of the day and just happened to stop in Firstly the atmosphere was great nice music playing in the background and sports on TV The bartender was very polite and knowledgeable about the beers and ciders Grabbed an old rosie cider and a burger and didnt look back Cider was wonderful and the burger was delicious Highly recommend this pub to anyone looking for a well priced beer and some good foodLovely litle hideaway to grab a meal we enjoyed pizza and local beers and single malts The wait staff was friendly and helpful and we would definitely eat here againThis is my new favourite pub for watching football since becoming a Leither There are plenty of screens and for popular games they also have a projector This place is no one trick pony though They also do good grub They have various deals running throughout the week my favourite being the sandwich and a soft drink for a fiver These are very tasty and generous sandwiches The fish goujons one is great and for an extra quid you can get chips too The beers are also pretty decent with guest ales and a well stocked fridgeAll in all its hard to find much wrong with this pub Reasonably priced It has a nice layout and decor and feels clean The atmosphere has been quite relaxed whenever Ive been in and the staff are usually pretty friendly and not shy about painting saltires on their faces when Scotland are playing They are happy to accommodate small groups though its best to book a table in advance if you plan to eat on a busy night I should also add that its dog friendly Roger jumped up and chewed on my wrist everytime I celebrated a goal And since that game was against Gibralter my wrist was pretty raw by full timeVisited this place for a late dinner after touring Edinburgh for the day It was a good choicethe bartender sassed me just the right amount for my lack of knowledge about literally any Scottish beerale but then gave me tastes of everything he had on tap he thought I might like and he was cutealways a bonus The burger I got was good and it seemed like it would be a pretty fun place to watch a football game also Would definitely go back"

    "review":"Maybe not Edinburghs best kept secret like it used to be it can be tough getting a seat on sunny summer days but that doesnt detract from the fact the the Mosque Kitchen serves up a very tasty curry a rockbottom prices 350 for a big plate of chicken curry and rice The outdoor courtyard and its resident pigeons may not be the most alluring of settings but its impossible to argue with the quality and quantity of the food being served up Long may it continueExcellent food and super cheap Its very much cheap and cheerful Youll be sitting outside under a tarp on a plastic chair eating off a paper plate with a plastic fork but the curry is so good that you wont care You get huge portions and they do take away tubs too if you want to eat half now and take half for the next day Very casual and super friendly Its cash only so remember to pop to the cashpoint round the corner on the wayVisited the Mosque Kitchen earlier today  Ordered the Chicken Curry  Rice with a Naan  Although the cost has gone up quite significantly from the 3 pounds quoted in earlier reviews its still well priced The setting itself is pleasant enough and what you should expect for the kitchen of a mosque Staff were friendly and polite I think however Ive been spoiled by visits to many Curry Cafes in London Birmingham Stoke and Manchester In those places often with very humble surroundings Ive experienced food that is comparatively priced or cheaper and far more flavoursome I generally prefer visiting establishments like this to  la carte restaurants as I like to imagine the experience is more authentic for an everyday man like me  The search will continue for me however for a comparable Curry Cafe in Edinburgh  Scotland to that which Ive experienced beforeOkay so here is the thing there are two mosque kitchens The story is that the owners of the one that opened years ago by the mosque decided to move it and is today called the same Mosque kitchen and is by the corner of Nicholsen Square Then the mosque decided to open the kitchen of theirs under the name The original mosque kitchen Since Ive always gone to the mosque I know that the brain behind the menu and the kitchen staff moved along to the Mosque Kitchen So out of curtsy to the first kitchen I have since they moved gone to eat there I went once and tried the food here at The Original Mosque Kitchen and didnt really enjoy it and continued to go to the first oneThen yesterday when I saw that people was reviewing the two kitchens under the same name I felt this had to be sorted but more important for me I decided to take off my curtsy jacket and try it again with open heart and free mind So here is my reviewOne thing is for sure that the terrace here is very charming and I love the feeling of sitting sheltered from the rain and enjoy food outside They might not me the original kitchen but it is a very original placeThe staff is so welcoming and nice and I get happy just entering the kitchen to order food  The menu is just the same with option of lamb curry chicken curry barbecue chicken grilled lamb shish spinach mix lentil sauce chickpea sauce vegetable stew and rice for all dishesThe price is amazing I had lamb curry with rice and lentil sauce and paid 550 including a tropical juice WOWThe portions are massive and one has to ask to get less if not to hungry and wish to respect foodThe lamb was a bit dry but the flavours of the sauce lentil and rice was absolutely delicious and I loved it I have to say that if I add the over all experience it is a clear 4 star If the meat wasnt dry it would have been a 5 starSo next will be to try the Mosque Kitchen and decide with a fresh mind where I will go from now onIn my opinion this restaurant is better than the Mosque Kitchen on Nicolson Square I have no idea what the backstory is here Are they owned by the same person are they competitors I have honestly no ideaHowever since this kitchen is actually beside the mosque I tend to support the idea that its the originalThe main guy who I see working here is very friendly and welcoming He always comes to the table to take my order and the service is generally quite quick The menu has a large selection of meat and vegetable curries for excellent prices really hard to beat anywhere elseThere is also baklava available for dessert which is greatDefinitely worth a stop if you enjoy curry and good bargains"

    "review":"Absolutely wonderful true Italian food so delicious  The service was great and very friendlyI have been coming here since it used to be called nyam nyams Though a little further away from the city centre the new location of rigatonis is much more spacious and comfortable for a meal out I was first introduced to this place by some of the Italian community and quickly saw why This is a family business and the manager and his wife are ItaloScozzesi their family is originally from near Napoli Both are bilingual and very friendly expect good and very informal customer service On offer are pizzas pasta paninis risotto ravioli gelato a particularly famous tiramisu and a few daily specials I have tried the pizza and pasta The pasta is really good al dente and flavoursome There is also gluten free pasta available which is handy for me given that I am avoiding wheat The pizza is a little bit small considering the price though its quite nice The turkish delight icecream is absolutely divine The tiramisu is probably one of the best in Edinburgh apart from my own homemade own of courseA few Italian products which cannot be easily found in Scotland are also for sale including mulino bianco biscuits antipasti and instant polentaAfter being in the UK for a month I desperately needed something other than fish n chips You may think that would make my review biased but I am fullblooded Italian so I critique any bite of Italian food I get my hands on This almost tasted like home Dont tell my Nonna I said thatThis familyrun Italian restaurant is certainly worthy of its awards The service is impeccable and the food is amazing Al dente noodles fresh delicious marinara and just the right balance of flavors in every dish made the meal perfect Add an amazing Nutella cheesecake for dessert and it was elevated to sublime The ownerchef Stefano came to the table and could not have been more gracious as were his wife and son who served us"

    "review":"I had my first experience taste of Philpotts today and I have mixed opinions The shop itself is bright and clean as are the staff who all wear shirts and ties which I found slightly bizarre for what is essentially a glorified sandwich shop There are three distinct areas to the shop a salad bar a sandwich bar and a hot food area I wasnt sure what I fancied so I had a little browse and asked the lady if they could toast up sandwiches seeing as there was a hot food area I thought this wouldnt be too much of a problem  turns out it was and unless I chose one of the premade ciabattas from the hot food counter my sandwich couldnt be toasted Darn So instead of a much desired toastie I ended up having pastrami and stilton with chilli mayo on an olive bread roll Admittedly my sandwich was really tasty and I was full for the rest of the afternoon but the prices are quite high and the selection of fillings is not particularly inspired: I wont be rushing back anytime soonWould you imagine a Phil Potts wearing shirt and tie Me neither so why the staff are all spruced up is beyond me  Nonetheless Pottss monthly sandwich specials are usually top notch  Currently its a chicken spinach red pepper and tarragon mayo concoction that firmly places itself in the upper band of quality sandwichesThe seemingly pretentious image and bog standard name is a funny combination If only Phil could stick to what he does best: making sandwichesThis is one if my regular go to places to pick up a quick lunch I really like this place for lunchtime takeaway salads mainly although they are pretty expensive at 430 for a small salad box Eek However they are very very tasty and satisfying and you can choose from a base of pasta couscous or leaves or even a mix of both Although the salad options are already written up on the board the signature is my fave they are happy to remove and replace anything you dont like No problemThey also do a roast of the day which you can get served with some scrummy roast potatoes Not for anyone with a light appetite though They usually have 3 soups on offer again expensive and there are MUCH cheaper places nearby that also do nice soupsThe service is speedy and friendly It gets 3 stars from me for the quality of food on offer If it wasnt so pricey it would have got moreIt is a tough review for me as a vegetarian and as someone who usually opts for a meal deal over spending 5 on lunch for a working dayThe meal deal only has one veggie lunch sandwich and one veggie wrap option but dozens of meat based ones So I get fed up f the veggie ones very quickly However if you get a sandwich made to order it is amazing I love getting fresh lemon juice drizzled over avocado and grated carrot and salad But it starts getting prohibitively pricey Please can you do moe veggie options in the meal dealAs part of my yelping duties I ventured in here the other day As Emma said I was slight confused as to why the staff were dressed in shirts and ties Come on you are selling sandwiches there is no possible way you can make that fancy so quit trying So Phil Potts tries to be a sort of upmarket sandwich shop selling salads sandwiches and hot food When I went in there was one other customer and around 10 members of staff I stood waiting while one member of staff served the man in front and the rest stood around gossipping I guess looks can be deceiving as the fancy attire doesnt lead to good service I ordered the special of Thai chicken with coriander mayo purely because the rest of the menu was so dull I was a little disappointed to see the bread was pretty much just a loaf of Hovis and the filling was a tiny little tubs worth The sandwich was pretty tasty but nothing in comparison to the much more interesting Thyme which is 1 minute up the roadI thought Philpotts was a sophisticated delicafe looking at it from the outside but I was sorely disappointed when I ventured inside and realised it is a sandwich shop and a pretty poor one at that Situated in the busy and bustling Lothian Road in Edinburgh Philpotts is just a short walk from the city centre and so it ought to be one of the hot spots for buying meals and snacks but unfortunately it is not They have a deli counter which houses the usual suspects for sandwich fillings  salad meats and cheeses etc However there is nothing that special about their menu or their sandwiches which would make you want to go back I ordered a BLT sandwich which was tasty although the bread was nothing special and to be honest I felt as though I could have made the same thing myself at home for a cheaper price The staff were friendly although I am with the other Yelpers in wondering why they are all dressed in a shirt and tie Hot drinks roasts and salads are also available here and there is a seating area inside Philpotts is a fairly average sandwich shop but there is nothing about it which would make me want to go back"

    "review":"While the location of Voujon is slightly off the beaten track I would thoroughly recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for quality Indian cuisine The waiters were immensely patient with our large party Service was excellent and this was matched by the high quality food and wide range of dishes available Very good value for money tooVoujon prides itself with modernish Indian and Bengali food to the extent where it has positive reviews in its restaurant window from various local papers or diners who has testifiedDont let these fool you though Voujon isnt as great as it claimsThe modern cooking is uninspiring and totally lacking the flavours that traditional Indian food would deliver in an instant This pretty much described the dissapointment we felt for the whole meal  lacking that certain something the punch as it were The food generally tasted like something you could buy from a supermarket but was way more expensiveHowever Voujon has some redeeming features  the restaurant is beautifully modern and elegant  and the staff were helpfulOverall Voujon was a dissapointment  and I doubt Voujon will post this review in its windowI went to the Bengali and Indian restaurant Voujon for the first time a few weeks ago and since then I have been back twice  They serve traditional and authentic Indian dishes which are full of flavour I have had a few of their curry dishes and my favourite is the King Prawn Bhuna which is very tasty and quite spicy but not too much that it ruins your meal The dishes at Voujon are all very well presented and the foo is reasonably priced with main meals around 9 and there is an extensive veggie menu available as well They offer several different types of rice and there is plenty of variety of side dishes to accompany your meal The decor inside is very authentic and modern whilst the staff have always been very attentive and warm  Voujon also do takeaways and is available for private functionsThis place promises a lot apart from anything else its refreshing to find an Indian resturant close to the city centre which isnt full of rowdy groups lured in by the cheap food and Bring Your Own Bottle policy Unfortunately it doesnt quite deliver everything it promisesTheres no denying that the dcor is beautiful  the solid oak furniture and linen tablecloths certainly give the place an upmarket feel but when main courses are  around 1015 without any rice or naans you would expect something more from the food than it actually deliversThat said they offer a handful of set banquets for two people which work out at roughly 20 per head including starters right through to main courses although my friends that I ate there with said that theirs was pretty bland and dullI wouldnt go as far as saying it was a bad meal but I havent been in a mad rush to go back to Voujon since my first visitI came to Voujon with my flatmates a few months ago and whilst the service and atmosphere were excellent the food wasnt quite up to the same standard as some other Indian restaurants in the area  The decor feels modern fresh and clean with plenty of neatly laid out tables and really comfortable seats  The staff are attentive friendly and know everything about the menu which always helps when you have no idea what to expect from a certain dishI went for the tandoori chicken kebabs with rice which didnt take long to arrive but tasted a litle dry  The salad it was served with was fresh and there were some great flavours going on yet it was just lacking some sauce  Id probably come to Voujon agai but I just expected a little more from the foodReasonably good curry although not as good as the reviews on the window claim  I agree with the other reviews that it promises more than it really delivers"

    "review":"Hawke  Hunter has that effortlessly polished selfconfident feel about it that does equate to a pretty awesome eating and drinking experience In its previous lives as The Hallion and Home House this was a private members club but thankfully no longer and I would suggest to anyone tiring of staring at the same old dance floors and bar stools to come along to the East End and experience something a bit differentHawke  Hunter is set out over several floors of pretty spacious Georgian Townhouse grandness with the inconspicuous entrance which looks a bit like it could be the door to an office or someones house leading inside to the restaurant on the ground floor I recently came here for my friends hen do for which we hired out one of the private dining rooms It was really really lovely and beautifully decorated with the fortune of having our own dining space being absolutely ideal for our purposes which included a banterful quiz on my engaged friends life plus a few speeches and some loud nostalgia and storytelling The food was also lovely classic with a bit of a modern tweak to it It wasnt the cheapest experience of all time but not too expensive either considering the private dinner party experienceUp the winding staircase youll find the main bar which is really striking With its sweeping bar surface and Art Deco looks plus a tasty cocktail list this is definitely a very cool place for a drink The ladies toilets are something else too Not something you flag up in a review but the grandeur of the powder room classier than toilet is an amazing place for a quick gossip on the chaise longue provided for such activities Aside from the bar and restaurant there is also a whisky bar up a further flight of stairs and some boutique hotel rooms for guests Hawke  Hunter has definitely been an alcohol scented breath of fresh air for Edinburgh with a mix of well heeled and quirky individuals looking for something more than whats on offer in other parts of town Super recommendedSo last time I was here it was called Ego This was 3 years ago and Mr Scruff was doing a DJ set that I went to to photograph for the Student Newspaper Ego had its weekend gay night I hope that doesnt sound inappropriate but thats very literally what it was and so I heard about it from my flatmate quite often as well Its a really cool venue very decadent looking and velvety Now its the Hawke and Hunter and continues to be located in Edinburgh Pink Triangle not to be confused with the Pubic Triangle alongside GHQ and the Street I went to Hawke and Hunter because surprise surprise its been turned into a venue where theyre playing Hot Mess by Ella Hickson I recommend seeing it It was an interesting space dark with paintings that lit up on the ceiling and strange lines of colourful lights on the floorI used to associate this ultrachic restaurantbar with those who liked to be seen in Edinburgh yahs etc as it was once a privatemembers club so imagine my surprise when I went to Hawk and Hunter for a friends birthday  it was really really lovely The decor is really chic and the toilets are amongst some of the best Ive ever experienced in Edinburgh There are two quality indicators I like to use when reviewing places   the toilet and the temperature of the wine I give Hawke and Hunter 10 out of 10 for both Especially the bathroom its worth visiting for that reason aloneThe Georgian style of the restaurant is typical of Edinburgh NewTown with a really dramatic sweeping staircase taking you up to the bar and up again to the restaurant Its really cool and I loved just sitting on the sofas looking around me The only thing I would criticize which I would by lying if I said I didnt expect was the price You just know youre going to be paying for the drink as well as for the surroundings Otherwise its really worthwhile paying it a visit PLUS its open till 3am  for the suave amongst us who like to be out but dont like the stinky clubs this is the place to goWe normally stay in 5 Star Hilton Gardens however the budget is tight and a very reasonable offer enticed us to the 4 Star Picardy PlaceThis building has a mix of character dating 300 years and with only 11 rooms their attention to detail was just WoWThe decor was fantastic and there was no a single spot of dusf in the room With a beautiful view the TV at the bottom of the bed  a deep bath complete with TV My only grumble was that there was no elevator but I cant give it less than 5 Stars If you want luxury and some down time this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in and most certainly recommendI joined over 200 folk here last night for the annual EdTwestival and so am reviewing Hawke and Hunter as a venue I know its also a bar restaurant club and dinnerjoint But after working here for a few hours alongside the staff and admiring the gorgeous interior its safe to say Ill be heading back soon to dineIts in a nice wee location just round from Broughton Street one of my favourite places in Edinburgh and beside the Met cocktail bar Easy to get to and with lots of bars in reachWe were using the upstairs space and the downstairs and outdoor space The upstairs hall is really quite big and easily fit over 100 folk a cake stand and some bands in The acoustics were good too and it never got too hot the ceilings are really tall I love old Edinburgh buildings so that helpedI was working up the front desk checking people in alongside the cloakroom The girl on the cloakroom was really lovely and dealt very well with the stress of a lot of people looking to check in check coats in and getting us confused about who was doing what The bouncers I spoke to were nice too and earlier on in the day the staff setting up were more than helpful So big thumbs up for all the great people that work thereThe downstairs club area was really cosy nice booths with a big open space at the bar Despite being crowded it never felt too crowdedRecently theres been a lot of press around the new chef at Hawke  Hunter My incessant curiosity and foodie nature combined with my positive impression of Hawke and Hunter at Twestival means Ill certainly be back to update this review with foodie ravings galoreA Friday regular before my travelling year even had my leaving do here I was not keen upon return to find Hawke  Hunter had finally given in to the Happy Hour ban that had come into play in 2009 of which they had initially managed to find a way around And sure enough upon my return to Friday HH drinks it looked like the effect had well and truly set in as my fellow socialisers and I found the bar to be downright emptySo with a heavy heart and a fickle attitude I shunned Hawke  Hunter from my social itinerary foreverOr maybe not fate would have itWith my sisters birthday this Saturday past she had the idea of a Voodoo RoomsHawke  Hunter doublewhammy I didnt even know either were on her radar but who was I to argue So off I trotAnd my faith in Hawke  Hunter was reignitedNow I should clarify that my reasons for the aforementioned shunning was down to the lack of atmosphere and NOT the lack of happy hour Hawke  Hunter is an exremely pretty bar make no mistake but with no clientele or atmosphere it is all for noughtHowever you pour over a helping of bohemia throw a dash of posers in with a sprinkling of working class and even a sprig of student vibe to top off shake up this eclectic mix of Edinburgh patronage and you end up with the buzzy atmosphere of Saturday night Hawke  HunterOn paper this place should be more pretentious than it actually is You have the immaculate upstairs bar playing a retro movie across the linendraped wall you have the intimate outdoor garden with its inviting plush seating you have the intriguing array of eclectic cocktails at slightly above average prices However the crowd that make up an evening here are such a mixed bag you never get that are they judging me feeling Not even from the staff something you cant say the same for somewhere like Electric Circus lets sayHawke  Hunter I missed youPROS: All of the aboveCONS: No JD For shame"

    "review":"The Magnum isnt on the main strip of bars and restaurants so you have to know about it and a lot of faithful and local regulars do Its been here since 1981 so its a bar of the 80s which automatically makes it cool of course It was the fairy lights around the big arched windows that lured me in as twinkling fairy lights always do and theres definitely a bit of something romantic going on here so if you staring into each others eyes and being lovestruck is your thing then this is a good place to do itAside from loved up dining and drinking The Magnum is also really nice for a just a drink and a banter with friends The bar has a really friendly feel to it classy but laidback and you do feel a bit like youre part of a cool New Town gang of some kind they accept me for who I am etc sob They have a really tasty pretty classic Scottish food menu and a separate restaurant area for food eating activities Very decentThe Magnum was the very first culinary experience my wife  I had in Scotland It was also the first time we tried Haggis First the pics dont do their food justiceand the pics do look very good EVERYTHING we had was DELICIOUS We started with an appetizer of Haggis nips  tattiesYAY I am forever sold on that dish and so was my wifeWe then moved to a steakI forget which one it was but it was deliciousWe moved on to some form of cheesecake I think it was the only cheesecake they had so not too much trouble to figure out if youre there DELICIOUS In fact its been over a year and my wife was just commenting on how good it was a couple of days agoBy the way the pricing was very reasonableThere are a lot of great places to eat in Edinburgh and a lot of great things to see but if I went back there tomorrow my first stop would be to The Magnum for some Haggis nips  tatties Then off to High StreetOne of my alltime favorite restaurants  Enjoyed haggis there  Discovered St Mungos beer there my favorite beer but only available in ScotlandThis was the first restaurant that I went to in Scotland I wound up going based on the recommendation of one of the people working at the hotel I was staying at I didnt know what to expect but wound up being quite happy with the choice Actually I liked it so much that I wound up going back again the next night to try some different options off the menu Once again is did not disappointOne thing that is worth noting about this place is that it is worth making reservations It was full both nights that I went However I did go two nights over a bank holiday weekendIf I go back to Edinburgh I would definitely come back to this restaurantI so wish Id come here when I still live in the neighborhood  If Id known then what I know now I would have quickly become a regular  After a fantastic meal down the road at Locanda de Gusti The Man and I stopped in here for a drink  It is a warm and inviting pub but is not what I would call an Old Man pub  They had some unusual beers on tap but I was mostly drawn in by the friendliness of the staff and notcrowded conditions which are hard to find on a Saturday nightThe only down side is the atmosphere  By the end of our second drink not only was the bar notcrowded it was nearly empty  Maybe it does most of its trade earlier in the evening but I would have loved to have stayed here longer if I hadnt been looking for a bit more of an upbeat vibeVisited The Magnum while in town for business and then holiday The suggestion came from friends who live in the neighborhood and frequent The Magnum We could not have been happier The salmon cake starter was perfectly cooked and came with a tangy chili sauce My husband had the venison and was delighted You know a chef knows what hes doing when he cooks venison so that it is tender and juicy  bad venison is really BAD The red cabbage and blood pudding were perfect accompanimentsI had a good ol ribeye and was not disappointed The meat was tender cooked perfectly medium rare and the sides included lovely roasted potatoes and tomatoes The meat and veg were both incredibly fresh and full of flavorReservations recommended  the restaurant is not large and the bar can definitely get packed on the weekend But the staff is unbelievably helpful and gracious and friendly Wish we lived closer"

    "review":"Food wasnt very good all chicken was dry and they didnt refill items The buffet closes at 7 but they stopped refilling at 5:45 The server was very very rude didnt want to give us any more plates even though you need to change plates because of different curries Dinner buffet also wasnt very cheap at 10Initially slow service was far outweighed by the excellent food in large quantities at very reasonable prices For a Saturday night the place was given the level of quality surprisingly empty In recent years since I started going for sideorders rather than making a pig of myself with starters I cant recall eating so much in an Indian restaurant Definitely one to go back to but they need to work on that initial 5 to 10 minute period when you first arrive Knocking off two stars following my visit here with work a couple of Tuesdays ago We were a party of 13 and there was another large table set out when we arrived plus a smattering of duoscouples yet there were only 2 waiting staff on The quality of the food was undiminished yet that in no way makes up for it taking nearly 3 hours in all for us to be fully served Add to that the fact they were lucky to get the booking at all seeing as they failed to respond to my initial email request for a table and I had to resort to phoning them up  the result is I wont be back until I see some improvement noted on this site Such a shame considering how it was a couple of years agoEveryone I know raves about this place so I didnt mind at all when I heard we were heading there for a meal before a recent night outWhen we got there though the place was full of Uni sports teams filling themselves up on as much curry and beer as was humanly possibly and they were making sure that the whole restaurant knew itThe food wasnt bad although with it being a Saturday night they were quite busy and so service wasnt the best or the fastest When the food came it had obviously been waiting under a heat lamp because my curry had formed a skin on the top of it That said Ive done my fair share of parttime waitressing jobs so I know how horrible it can be when you have so many big groups in and when id scraped that off the underneath part was gorgeous The spice level was just right and unlike lamb dishes in a lot of cheaper curry places the meat wasnt at all chewy or fattyEveryone tells me I just had a rare oneoff bad experience Im going to go back and try their lunch buffet and see if thats true Watch this spaceI had never really considered coming to this place until me and a group of friends booked a table to celebrate the end of the semester before exams A lot of them had been before and generally the feeling was that the Red Fort was a good place for a meal and BYOB drinksAs we arrived two things hit me:1 This place was waaay smaller than I had expected and while nicely decorated it really could have done with using its space better as we all were crushed into one area and couldnt really move  so we ended up eating without trying to move our arms2 Secondly this place is HOT and I have been assured that it is always hot but the air conditioning unit above the door never gets swiched onAnyway to the food The menu was large but some what basic and uninspiring  but when our meals did come I really couldnt fault it it tasted wonderful and there was plenty of it Price wise I wasnt too shocked which was nice  the entire meal worked out at around 11 per headSo Red Fort does have nice food if a bit limited in choice and insperation  but it really is too small for the large parties it caers forIve been to Red Fort three times for their lunchtime buffet and had a great meal on each occasion  It is allyoucaneat for 6 with free refills on drinks also  The waiters are friendly and are always keen for you to have a good timeThe food is generally excellent with a small but tasty variety of vegetarian and meat curries along with a selection of rices and naan breads  The meat and poultry which they use is also good quality and you rarely end up with a mouthful of fatty sinewy lamb or beef as you can elsewhere  The curries are all signed clearly and ranked in order of heat allowing people to choose exactly what they are eating  They also serve a dinner menu which I am assured is up to the same high standardThe coke however has clearly been diluted with water as it tastes far weaker than normal  Also everyone could do with just a bit extra elbow room at the tables  These are just about my only complaints and Red Fort offers one of the best buffet lunches you will find in the areaI have walked past this place more times than I care to remember and been in for their 6 lunch buffets a few times Every time Im left a little less satisfied than when I went inhungry no but still wanting moreThe food is what you would expect from a place like this curries of all shapes and spices and a lot of vegeterian dishes I struggled to explore anything past a Tikka  im a spice pussythe value is very good but theres just not that spark"

    "review":"The best Turkish food in town  They have small tapas style dishes They bring it close to 9 varieties They are all yum and a must try My favorite of the lot is the grilled sausage This spread is quite filling We did not realize that and had additionally ordered grilled chicken and we couldnt finish it I have been there twice in a week alreadyOne of the best Mediterranean places in the city Amazing food and very welcoming service Great valueThe appetizers were good but the main courses were disappointing  At the end of the meal as we wanted to pay they told us the credit card machine wasnt working and that there was a sign  Yes its a sign about 812 by 11 posted in a corner of the room   Who is going to see that  They apologized for not telling us about that before we ordered but its really inexcusable  Fortunately we had enough cash  Service was friendlyIf you go here just let the waiter know your dietary requirements go for the mixed platter and let them choose Its the only way to do it The food was all beautifully prepared and presented and tasted as good as it looked Particular favourites of mine were the rice wrapped in vine leaves dish and the aubergine one and well theyre all pretty good Feeling brave Go for a glass of Aylan not for everyone but it perfectly complements the dishesTheir hummus is bomb strong on the garlic Just like it should be Homemade pita was grubbing as well Perfect small dinner nice staff and I have a free baklava for my next visit"

    "review":"I agree with Brett McKirdys is a little bit of a let down and Ruth Chris is the businessIm not much of a steak expert but how you cook it doesnt matter its the quality of the meat Im not saying this stuff is low grade or anything its good But it doest merit the acclaim that the waiters were quick to give it The meat looked a little skinny definitely not what I was expectingDesert was excellent though So give this place a try if youre not expecting muchwanna know my idea of a 5 star steak then just take a look at the 2 photos ive posted on my yelp profile wherever i go i search out the best bovine offerings here in edinburgh after several inquiries i decided to try this place in search of superb steak it was tough to get in over the weekend but i landed a table sunday night expecting 4star or better beef especially considering the reputation of scottish beef i began with their award winning minisausages not bad there were several different tasty varieties served up i opted for the ribeye advertised at a mere 8 ounces so i didnt expect a hearty portion i got a quality steak cooked perfectly to order but nothing special and very very thin suitable for a really good steak and eggs breakfast could my mild disappointment be because steaks are just different back home in the states the two scottish steak afficionados at the next table mirrored my notsogreat verdict one of them said that the american chain ruths chris was the best steakhouse hed eaten at and even though its a chain i agree its leagues ahead of mckirdys shame since this place came so highly recommended but i thought their curly fries which i dipped in a lovely stilton blue cheese sauce were just as good as the steak and thats never a great signWent here based on a recommendation from the concierge at our hotel Regretted it the moment we walked in the door The place is lacking in hospitality and decoration It is small and the average age was 63 and this was on a Saturday night at 830pm The food was just OK although I will note that my steak was cooked perfectly but lacked salt therefore lacked flavor I believe our assorted steamed veggies were frozen and possibly microwaved My plain mash was that  PLAIN I was hoping that it would have a little bit of flavor but it didnt The onion rings were not fresh or homemade I could have purchased the same quality at Sainsburys Not impressive to say the least Would have rather gone to Wildfire even though I have never been there At least they would have had a modern restaurant for me to marvel at instead of the radiator with food crusted to itDress code is casual This place is nothing special as far as look and feel and our concierge did advise us of that but this was below that set expectation"

    "review":"The food and service at this restaurant was awesome Both dishes that we ordered were just excellent The staff was very friendly and accommodating We will definitely go back again if we are in the area Great value for the moneyWeve been staying at the house of an Indian chef and got this place recommended as great place to have some proper Pakistani and Indian cuisine in town And boy it was delicious Dont expect haute cuisine dining or even proper seating this is a small joint where the curries steal all the fame We had Chicken Karahi Naan Keema Rice and tried some more stuff from a friendly Scottish guest who was a regular here The only thing I personally didnt like was the mixed appetizer plate which was precooked and not crunchy anymore It didnt pass the excellence test in my book Yet there is an infinite amount of two chutneys to go along with the main dishes so Id call it a draw The owners are a friendly bunch and you wont leave this place with an empty stomach so if you are in need of a good proper spice cuisine stop by and throw some money at this place You wont regret it its greatTipsy and craving some delicious nighttime kebab  Kebab Mahal will be there for you with a delicious doener filled with greasy meat drippy sauces and garlic breath the next morning  Kinda grotty and not the absolute best doener place in Edinburgh but it will forever hold a special place in my heart and likely my arteriesErm This place is amazing Ive heard about the Kebab Mahal on the Edinburgh grapevine for years But for some reason I never felt the need to go there But now I always feel the need to go there Because the food is fantastic And oh so cheap This is not a posh restaurant Oh no Its formica tables and stools and weird items stuffed up the back of the room Theres even two parts to the place separated by a proper wall and accessible only by going outside and entering another main door This is what I like to call personality Me and my other half had an incredible meal here in the completely separate restaurant from everyone else We ordered a starter of onion bhajis three arrived the size of steering wheels followed by a veritable feast of Indian main courses I opted for two sides and a naan to keep me filled and the bloke opted for a main course rice naan and a side We couldnt finish it all and took the rest home All that wonderful food only came to 26 And the service was good too  our waiter was pleasant and we even helped him shift some tables to accommodate us It felt like a mad family meal  will absolutely definitely totally be back for more Long live Kebab MahalOn our me and hubby two day visit to Edinburgh this was one of the best finds A hole in the wall kinda restaurant seems to be very busy and dishes out absolutely lip smacking dishes with ease We had been to Kebab Mahal twice and both the times we loved the food If you are one of those people who prefer posh restaurants over good food then my friend this place is not for you This place looks more like a fast food joint but but but the food is nothing like fast food The two times we were here we tried the shammi kebab chicken tandoori chicken bhuna kharahi murgh accompanied with super yummy tandoori garlic naan All the dishes including the naan was absolutely delicious At the end after you have stuffed yourself with these goodies if you still have any room left for dessert do try the baklava Best baklavas i have ever tasted We also tried the almond cake which was also yummmm Delicious food excellent service and warm  welcoming staff  awesome gastronomic experienceNothing more to add than the others have said its great Surprisingly extensive menu unbeatable prices convenient"

    "review":"Nice wee cafe this Its just a shame it took them more than 20 minutes to make two paninis Eve Then they only arrived after prompting The three points are for the good cup of coffee tasty hommus and pleasant surroundings Dont think Ill be returning if Im ever in a hurry thoughThe newest of the two Olly Bongos branches in Edinburgh this cosy caf is a great spot for eating out whilst still eating food that tastes homecookedThere are always three different soups on every day  two of which are veggie  but the lentil and bacon never fails I have eaten here several times both for breakfast and for lunch and i would struggle to say which one is better as both are consistently tasty and good value for moneyFor breakfast for those with larger appetites id recommend the Breakfast Bagel 595 which comes stacked high with crispy bacon beans and a fried egg or for those wanting a slightly healthier start to the day then the Light Bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese or the generous portion of granola with fresh fruit and yogurt is definitely worth tryingDespite its location right next to the University campus this caf is popular with students and nonstudents alike and its easy to see why Dont miss the MultiVit Smoothie 295 with kiwi strawberry banana and pineapple extremely effective for curing flu and hangovers alikeThis is a lovely little cafe that is very traditional As Fiona said it is very traditional and has a strong sense of homecooking about itTheir bagels are to die for Theres no other way to put it They are amazing but their prices arent Yeah its probably one of the best bagels Ive ever had but also one of the most expensive Their smoothies too are really good this is probably what I buy most from here They have a variety to choose from and if you tell the people behind the counter what you need  ie either energy boost or something to lift you up they will provideThis was previously Glen Has Cafe and when it closed I was gutted Fortunately it reincarnated with the same menu  same friendly staff just different decor and so it remains one of my favourite cafes This is partly to do with the proximity to Edinburgh University and my flat but mainly to do with the friendly staff great coffee and even better bacon buttiesOn the few days that weather is nice here in the grim North the windows are thrown open and you can sit in the window on cushions and feel like you are sitting outside When its cold which is more likely they have cosy sofas to snuggle on with a bowl of soup or cup of coffee Other than staple breakfast and lunch items paninis soup full EnglishScottish breakfasts they also do some really tasty mezze platters that are great for sharingOne of the last days of this voucher so we booked a visit and were able to sit in the opened window when arrived I like this outsidebutinside tent like feeling theyve created A nice selection of scatter cushions and enough space between tables The menu was supplied and we were advised what we could order A sharing mezze starter with a pitta bread each was very tasty and I like the fresh yoghurt sauce However main course my chicken shishkebab surprised me as it was smaller than I expected it to be It wasnt shishkebabed  it was 6 loose pieces of very tasty and moist chicken and some Pitta bread I felt more like a tiny taster  starter portion than an actual main course The included wine was supplied in small sampling glasses  you know those that fit 2 bowls of icecream and that is it But when asked for medium size of the same whine we got some proper sized glasses  was it because we actually paid proper prices for that instead of a groupon voucher Service was attentive and efficient enough seeing how busy it was and  the waitress was by herself   Although bringing out a main BEFORE you clear the starters is in every restaurant a no no We got a nice Turkish coffee afterwards In all it was not bad nice enough but nothing specialI went to Olly Bongos to use a voucher for a turkish dinner for 2Started off with a shared meze platter which was delicious It came with houmous cous cous stuffed vine leaves olives and roasted vegetables plus some toasted pitta bread It was all good great flavours and the plate was finished quicklyFor main course I chose a mixed kebab chicken and lamb What was offered was about 3 pieces of chicken and 2 small minced lamb patties Again it was all very flavourful  but I cannot help but wonder if this was a voucher portion The price you would pay for this dish is 890 and I think you can get a bit more for your moneys worth elsewhere quantity wise The wine merlot that we drank with this meal was very nice and we asked for more wine large glass Now the drinks seem more reasonable Large glass of red for 350 The meal was finished with a turkish coffee which was nice but nothing exceptional However I think I would come here again maybe for a lunch time snack as the food is tasty"

    "review":"Was craving something ricey and popped in here for the 799 lunch special You get some form of soup gyoza or spicy edamame this was great big bowl of them steeped with whole chilies and slices of ginger and salt and then a rice or noodle dish We both had the chickenduck in the namesake Hong Fu sauce the typical chinese brown sauce sort of like oyster sauce  soy sauce which was fine just fine We also requested the char siu pork buns which were a bit shoddy looking but this signalled homemade I hope tasted like it should bright red and sugary minced pork in a soft white steamed bun I wouldnt say come of your way to go here but if youre in the area it hits the spothighly recommend to try this is robin from china to write this not familiar with the other chinese food in the downtown aera this is the truly chinese food with traditional taste if any wanna wanna try the true chinese food this is the right place Not real Chinese I have lived in Beijing Shanghai and Taiwan and the dishes were not at all authentic The Kung pao chicken was heavy on a thick sauce that was gooey and loaded with sugar The chicken was so soft as to be almost like mashed potatoes in texture  The sauce tasted like it came out of a jar   I have had the kung pao all over asia and it was nothing like this  It can be served with a sauce or more like a dry stir fry but this was not good  My wife had the shui Zhu niu rou a beef in soup dish and it was tasteless as was my daughters extra spicy chicken  The wait staff got into a small argument with a customer over a mistaken order of fries rice which was odd as they were locals and the restaurant risked chasing away future business  Anyhow there are better choices in townHongfu offers an excellent range of dishes in nononsense surroundings Portions are generous dishes are wellexecuted with the Mongolian beef and mountain chicken proving particular favourites with our partyOverall we think Hongfu has solid claims on being one of the best restaurants of its type in EdinburghI so wanted to like Hong Fu Noodle  The Man has been wanting to come here for ages so last night after viewing a property we came here for dinner on our way down the roadHong Fu Noodle is located where The Ark used to be  so it was a little weird for me to be eating a meal where I used to come for gigs  The layout was ok if a bit chilly but the ambiance was definitely lacking in that there were a maximum of two other tables in the reasonably sized restaurant it felt quite empty  This place serves what I imagine is proper Chinese food  no sweet and sour pork or chow mein in sight  We started with pork dumplings I would call them pot stickers and ribs  The dumplings tasted nice but were I would say a little under done  The ribs were lukewarm they had clearly been sitting while the dumplings were made and very dry   To make up for this they were slathered in sauce  The Man loved them though so that worked  For our mains I ordered the monks vegetarian noodle soup and The Man ordered the Chinese roast duck and pak choi on crispy noodles  The duck was dry and the noodles were not crispy but this dish was overall very tasty  I kept stealing bites until he finally just swapped dinners with me  My soup was atrocious  It had a layer of veggies 1 pak choi complete with dirt a couple of bits of carrot cut like butterflies a couple of strips of bell pepper a couple of muchrooms and something called cloud ear  Ive just looked this up on Wikipedia and the article says this is usually sold dried and needs to be soaked before use While almost tasteless it is prized for its slightly crunchy texture and potential medicinal properties including its newly discovered anticoagulant properties Of note the slight crunchiness persists despite most cooking processes  It was slimy not crunchy  AnywayThe broth was about as tasteless as dish water and the noodles were just gummy and flavourless  Even The Man agreed it was pretty minging  Our meal came to 3190 which we both agreed was quite steep for what wed eaten  We went up to pay and were informed that they dont take cards  Maybe I just wasnt paying attention but I didnt see a sign stating that anywhere  We had just enough on us but unfortunately had to leave a very small tip for the lovely waitress because wed run out of money  The saving grace of this place was the waitress  She was literally the nicest and most polite waitress I have ever come across ever  I really felt terrible about scrapping together a 1 or 2 tip from whatever coin we had on us  But then as we both lay in bed last night with our tummies making gurgling noises and with heart burn or something up a storm I felt a little less badWe have been to this noodlebar several times now and  we are very pleased with the dishes service and the atmosphere They are very well located on Waterloo Place overlooking the Balmoral Hotel Waverley Station Princes Street Gardens and the War Monument A window seat is recommendedI am used to hot and spicey foods I normally would request additinal spices  chili  pepper  what I didnt have to do here My favourite starter dish is found here : Edamame  I recommend their chefs special beef in garlic  chili sauce  and the dumplings  on request you can get normal cutlery but authenticity requires chopstick When we visit the place is always frequented by asian people and that is an recommendation in itself There is a space in the back with big round tables and I noticed on one occaision they had a group of about 30 people in  so Id gather from that they do groups as well good for a night out or a quick bite"

    "review":"I wasnt 100 convinced upon my first visit to Deli Fresco Despite enjoying my lunch there the constant dulcit tones of Frank Sinatra blaring away in the background grated a bit Im as partial to a bit of Ol Blue Eyes as the next man but not quite at that earcrushing volumeWith the volume thankfully turned down yesterdays visit was exceptionally enjoyable The food is the usual baguettes paninis soups and salads but is all very well done very well priced and even dished up on a nice shiny plateUnlike many lunch stops its a comfortable and quiet enough place to sit in as well If you find yourself round about this area and the hunger pangs start Id recommend it with full vigourThis fantastic cafedeli just off Princes Street has been open for over three years and their menu is just mmmmI went in with a friend and had the most fascinating conversation with the owner about countries of origin and the Uppsala film festival in Sweden But now to the serious stuff the fooddddTheyve got a large range of meat and vegetarian dishes and the usual list of paninis with quite unusual ingredients For example the smoked turkey tomato cranberry was a bit of a novelty for me but was quite delicious Theyre quite affordable and claim to use ZERO articial ingredients so they win the health vote as wellStopped for lunch while on vacation in Edinburgh  Great value and great foodI had a panini with mozzarella roasted red peppers spinach and pesto and I added salami  Husband had the Meaty Man sandwich with chicken bacon salami and cheese  We split a smoked salmonavocado salad  The food was delicious and serving sizes were good  Add two bottled sodas and our total bill was still under 12 pounds  Tiny place  maybe 10 seats insideGreat coffee paninis soup and service Great quality food good price Theres a sit in area but its not very big Convenient locationDeli Fresco is in a great location for satisfying your hunger pangs after a harrowing trek up Leith Walk  I came here earlier this year after a long day at the shops it was a tasty and valueformoney meal  Inside it feels fresh and clean with both indoor and outdoor seating  The service is welcoming friendly and seems to take your order and make the food much faster than anywhere elseIn the front counter they have an impressive selection of cakes and muffins which all seem pretty reasonably priced  They also serve paninis sandwiches baguettes and toasties most of which costing no more than 3  I had a meatball with cheese panini which tasted amazing took virtually no time to prepare and cost only about 350 with a can of coke as well I would definitely go to Deli Fresco again as I couldnt fault its service or its range and quality of foodI had an excellent lunch in here recently  lovely sandwich of toasty cheese and a salad  Would come back again"

    "review":"I agree with Stuart on certain points  Dersim Kebab House is open late and its cheap so in that sense its got its perks But Im put off by how glaringly greasy the food isIve not seen it open early in the day to be fair the thought of getting a kebab before midday is revolting but illuminated by its strip lighting it looks a bit seedy at nightBefore you get in the door you are greeted with massive laminated pictures of all the meal deals they do They dont really try to tart up the appetisers by giving them names they refer to them in numbers Not exactly tempting when its seemingly served up like prison foodIm being a bit harsh  the content wasnt actually that bad Morbid curiosity led me to eat in here and I wasnt actually disappointed Portions are very generous and the staff are friendly enoughDont get me wrong  Ive had worse kebabs But even though Im basing this critique on the appearance of Dersim Kebab House its just as important as whats inside With the shabby frontage and less than appealing signs in the window they sell themselves short The food is decent enough and if its two in the morning you could do worse than to hook yourself up with a kebab in hereI came to Dersim Kebab House just over a week ago with a friend whilst we were on our way to a flat party  It was the night of the football world cup finala and we were in a rush to get something to eat before getting there  Thankfully Dersim served us pretty tasty meals without any hassle at all  Their menu isnt exactly awe inspiring but has all that you would expect from a standard kebab house  I went for a chicken kebab with salad and chips which came to about 3 along with a bottle of water  a pretty good deal  The chicken however was a little dry but I managed to counteract this by squirting on a whole load of mayonnaise  The salad was fresh and the chips werent bad at all My mate had a cheeseburger with chips which he thought was pretty average as wellOn the whole its decent enough value for money food and friendly serviceThe people are friendly the food is cheap and delicious What could be better :DDersim do Kebabs a little differently but because I dont know how they cook them I cant exactly explain whyBut I can be certain of the following1 I can go with 10 and feed two people2 My food looks like it was cooked that day3 Virtually no grease from the Donner meat4 Crispy chips NOT SOGGY5 Chatty staff6 Open later than you care to be awakeSet the standard on Dalry roadI can only speak for their Lamb Shish wraps its the only thing Ive had but several times at that among the best hereHad the best Lamb Doner kebabs ever Lamb was moist and not dry like many others flavour was good the bread at the bottom was fresh and tasted good and salad was fresh they even put extra Jalapenos on top on request very good indeed Will go back definitely"

    "review":"Super resto indien et je pense tre assez difficile Cadre chic pas loin du centre service correct bon rapport qualitprix trs bons currys bonnes sauces menthe et mangue Top We were in Edinburgh for a few days and staying at the Caledonian Waldorf Astoria hotel which is only a few mins walk from this restaurant  We wanted to have a nice Indian meal and decided to give this place a try  That was where we went wrongThe concierge at the hotel called ahead for us  When we arrived at the restaurant we were seated in the front room  Restaurant is simple and classy looking and it was only about 12 fullWe were given menus and ordered drinks right away While we were placing our food order the drinks arrived  Out of our party of 4 one person only wanted water And a few of us asked for water alsoIt took us 5 mins plus to order As the menu is a little complicated and they carry some untraditional itemsWe ordered some starters and also wanted some rice with them This took time  The menu said plain basmati rice When we said we want some plain basmati rice we received some snotty comment about all of the rice dishes being basmati rice We finally got the waiter to understand what rice we wanted at which point he questioned why we wanted rice with the appetizers we want it thats whyThen came the main dishes I wanted some kheem traditional Indian lamb curry  Waiter decided to educate me on what kheema is Then he told me that they had minced lamb but wanted to know what currysauce I wanted it with  I asked I picked one and he told me that I should try something else He suggested another dish Which I said I dont enjoy He told us that if I had it in America then I should still try it here as Americans dont know how to cook 2 of us are American so this too did not go over wellWe finally finished ordering and the drinks arrived No water or glass of iceso we asked about it and were told to be patient and that it was comingA little while later our papad poppodum was brought out  Once we finished with these the appetizers came out  They decided to bring out the food without clearing the table So we had to help clear the plates so they had space to put the food downWe had ordered some chocked pakoras masala dosa lamb kebabs and a prawn an potato crepeFood was ok nothing spectacular  When the started were brought to the table We asked for more chutney And specifically asked for some tamarind and some green chutney Half way through the appetizers we stopped eating and finally got the attention of one of the waiters to ask them about the chutneys As we needed them to eat out food  Again were were dismissed rudely and told it was comingWaiters were just standing around taking as not doing anything This was the last straw so we told them we wanted to see a manager and to cancel our entrees The wait staff told us we could not do that as our food was already ordered  Told them to get a manager On the phoneAfter asking for the manager our regular waiter came by and just started talking to us as if nothing had happened  I stopped him and told him again to call the manager and to cancel our main coursesWe paid for what we had consumed and left  On our way out we spotted another person who said that he was one of the owners We spoke with him and the waiter for a few mins But the waiter was just defensive and didnt think he had done anything wrongWe walked out and went to MOTHER INDIA  Avoid Indian Cavalry Club at all costs Service is atrocious and there are better ways to waste your money and more importantly timeThe service was slow the food took ages to arrive but when it did arrive it was AMAZINGIn fairness I have been here before and the service was much betterLooking for Indian delicacies and so we arrived at this place while being in Edinburgh Overall good experience and quiet place Service was good Food however was below expectations The ordered vegetables missed the flavor However the restaurant has the fine dine ala carte menu which gives you ample of time to order If no other better choice may visit againService as good as youd expect from somewhere as established as this and food quality pretty much along the same lines Marks off though for hustling a review from amongst the six of us Large range of vegetarian options and overall a well presented menu priced towards the upper end of the scale Not the place for rowdy groups so fairly peaceful although given its location I expect during the Six Nations it fills up and has to turn away a lot of passing tradeThis place is supposedly the best place to get curry in Edinburgh Being a big curry fan Im a man who drinks beer and watches football of course I love curry I thought itd be worth checking out Luckily I have friends who have birthdays and also like curry So we went on one of said friends birthdaysNow I love making curry myself Properly not from a jar I get my spices from Kamco on South Clerk St you should go  the samosas there are amazing and I like to think Im a bit of a dabhand at curry So Im rarely impressed when I go out for one This place just seemed to get everything wrong First of all we had to take out a mortgage to pay for it Overpriced Thats not the word Ripoff When youre paying upwards of 25 a head for curry you expect something pretty special It was OK but it definitely wasnt special It was too salty for a start And the waiters were rude and unhelpful They seemed to think they were above me which irked me Ill not ever be going back and now I owe Northern Rock a fortune"

    "review":"Formerly Club Ego more recently The Green Room pool hall this arm of Hawke  HunterMark Greenaway has now morphed into a steak house with ambitions  the club room downstairs will retain one of the pool tables and funnily enough host club nights whilst upstairs sees odd opening hours including dining til 3am on Saturdays when youll be in the company of a DJ and according to our waitress a burlesque dancer  I opted for French Toast with fruit on Sunday past as I was feeling a bit delicate but the full menu not it seems currently available on Sundays as they close at 6pm looks interesting and the meat my companions did manage to order was keenly priced and cooked exactly as requested None of them had any complaints about the food additional sauces many homemade and cutely packaged or the Merlot they had to accompany it all Early days yet but generally this looks to be a venture with promiseFinest meal Ive had in a long time Gorgeous starters perfect mains and WINE Love itGreat restaurant lots of steak varieties My girlfriend and I had the cote de boef nicely cooked rare The sides were delicious honey glazed carrots 3x cooked chips and sage squash were all fantastic For me personally it was a little bit too pompous in comparison to the direct competitor Kyloe which feels a little more relaxedThis is one of those really expensive yet average restaurants that charge an arm and a leg for absolutely everything Plates of food are small so in order to get a good feed you need to pile on sides like winter layeringFood is nice but due to the price I came away from here with a sour taste in my mouth They also employ cheeky ruses like mineral water instead of tap in order to squeeze more cash out of you and have a completely baffling menu  I came along for a meal deal  soup rump steak and chips and a glass of wine for a tenner It was a good deal until we realised the plates of food werent very big and we would really need to add on sides etc to feel full When the food arrived it was tasty and I did enjoy it  the chips were especially good I just think there are plenty other places in Edinburgh where I can get a great plate of food for much less than the menu prices in here Unless Im visiting with a deal or voucher I wont be back Also Im not a massive steak fan so thats probably another reason why Im a bit lacklustre about this venueI visited Steak for a midweek dinner with my family a couple of months ago On arrival I was completely taken aback with the decor It is modern simple spacious yet cosy Its amazing what you can do with some ropesWe enjoyed a lovely meal sure enough comprising mainly of steak and a lovely bottle of Merlot Service was a little disappointing at times Our drinks took longer than they should have in a quiet restaurant and our waitress seemed shocked when one of our party sent back a glass of coke which was made up of 90 ice The server also had an earphone device in her ear obviously used for communication between staff which resulted in us having to repeat our order because the kitchen were shouting in her ear Not her fault at all but it did come across as a little messy and unprofessionalThe above are very small hitches which I wouldnt normally dwell on but when the bill came for the meal I realised I should have been expecting more than just a mouthwatering steak Overall a lovely place to eat Great decor and fantastic food but I would be very hesitant in returning due to the overpriced meal and patchy serviceI came here because of the supercheap allweek pretheatre deal 3 course steak dinner for 16 anyone and I was not disappointedSteak has a great atmosphere it is an amazing building which used to be a ballroom Now the ceiling is painted black there is a big red neon lighting and a cool dcor The restaurant gives off a very cool and stylish vibeWe were sat down and given the pretheatre menu which gives a choice of 3 for startermaindessert I chose the steak tartar the steak frites and the cheeseboard while my partner chose the mushrooms steak frites and rhubarb cheesecake All the dishes were very good without flawsThe food is much more expensive outside of this deal so we were very pleased with itThe wine was slightly overpriced in my opinion 22 for a bottle but since our dinner was so cheap I didnt really mind The service was great: with every dish we were asked if the food was OK wine and water were poured and the waiters were personal whilst professional and not rehearsed at allI would definitely come back here I am recommending the pretheatre deal to all my friends and I am also very curious about their sisterrestaurant Steak on Stones cook your own steak on a hot stone"

    "review":"Its always great when you find someplace new in Edinburgh Stumbled upon this little basement bar just off Candlemaker Row on Saturday and what a great find it proved to be The place has a very comfy feel thanks to the basement setting and mix of furniture of the kind usually picked up from a second hand shop It was a little quiet when we arrived on Saturday lunchtime but since its not the most obvious location this is to be expected and will probably be a plus point as far as Im concerned When ordering food I was a bit dissapointed to be told the item off the specials board I was interested in was off How can a special be off so early in the day Take it off the board in that case I settled for a burger with red pepper pesto instead and my partner had a salad The burger was homemade and grilled to perfection accompanied by some sweet potato chips Both of us were happy with our choices and would definately eat here again Ill be checking out Under the Stairs again soon to see how it shapes up as an evening venueMy husband and I came here on our recent trip to Edinburgh and I absolutely loved it wished I could have brought it home with meFirst off the atmosphere Loved that all the tables and chairs looked to be yard sale finds and hand me downs although a lot of the tables were really short Fine for me but might be annoying for a taller person there to have dinnerThe menu was right up my ally especially after a week of sampling heavy pub foods The cocktail menu is super creative and my bloody mary had tons of veggies in the only thing I love more than a good bloody is a good bloody with food in it  Food wise there was plenty of options for a veggie and seafood loving gal like myself The only reason it gets only 4 stars is because my conchigle needed more sauce but thats just the opinion of a flavour whoreVery nice and cozy place Couches and relaxing furniture Candles Beer Good food How much more is there :This is the kind of place I love Rustic cozy atmosphere hip but none too complicated cocktails quality food not ridiculously expensive Started with olives and a whisky sour made with the bartenders choice whisky In the USA we usually have a whiskey sour bourbon but this Scottish version tasted really good mellowed with the egg white Highly recommended The olives both black and green were amazingly flavored and the serving size was ample to share For dinner I ordered the duck confit and they easily substituted potatoes for rice The duck melted in my mouth duck is my favorite dish and the sauce flavored the green beans and rice well I ordered an expensive  glass of Pinot noir with the duck as my cheeks were already red from a drinks session at the dragonfly and the whiskey sour Overall no complaints about the meal drinks and atmosphere When the three of us got the bill I did see a Questionable open drink sale charge that seemed phantom Additionally there were some Strange Guinness tactics going on someone ordered a Guinness and instead of taking it from the tap the bar tender poured it from a can and then stuck it under the Guinness tap for a while Not sure what that was about Overall I would definitely return to this gem under the stairs for a good drinks and eating sessionWhat a quirky little bar this is Id been warned beforehand that you need to book a table odd for a pub and sure enough when we walked in the waitress asked if we needed a table Luckily we were meeting friendsAs others have said its like an extended living room with lots of mismatched sofas rickety chairs and everyone kinda sprawled out in one open areaThe cocktail menu was extensive they had seasonal cocktails nice touch and the two I tried were both deliciousThe only problem was its table service and it takes a hefty long time to get someones attention Right now this place is very middle of the road for me I like the atmosphere I like the cocktails table service slow table booking a pain Im going to come back and try the food though  thatll swing it for me Ive heard good things about the parsnip friesGreat cocktail bar Underground atmosphere is really nice and the staff are super friendly Love the selection of cocktails but they are definitely on the sweet side so be warned of a sugar rush"

    "review":"If you are in the mood for a good Thai meal Thai Basil is the place to go Situated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street Thai Basil is just around the corner from the main University campus George Square and it is a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach The decor inside the restaurant and the soft music playing in the background gives the place a very authentic oriental atmosphere It is pretty small inside but inside of feeling cramped and crowded it feels lovely and cosy instead Thai Basils menu offers an expansive selection of authentic Thai dishes including Thai currys soups and salads I came here for lunch one day with a friend and had the most amazing Tom Kha soup It was chicken soups with coconut milk lemongrass ginger and a whole range of Thai herbs and spices and it was absolutely delicious The soup was made with the freshest ingredients and was full of flavour without being too spicy  yummy My friend had the Thai red curry with chicken which smelled amazing and my friend loved it I tried some and it was super but pretty spicy so I didnt really get a case of food envy here The staff at the Thai Basil are highly friendly and welcoming and the prices are very reasonable here with most main courses costing about six pounds A really great restaurant with beautiful tasting food definitely worth a visitTo my regret my closest experience with Thai culture is Thai kickboxing Thus I have to say that I am not an expert on Thai food That can change thoughAs one of my few Thai food experiences Thai Basil was quite lovely One of a few good independent far east Asian restaurants in the area Thai Basil has stood out to me From what I gather it sells traditional Thai restaurant food including a good range of Thai soup and curry I tried one such curry and thoroughly enjoyed itRestaurants like this one can be a bit pricey for the novelty of offering food not found commonly elsewhere in the city Thai Basil however is reasonably priced and main courses wont cost anymore than an Edinburgh average 610ishI look forward to revisiting Thai Basil and expanding my Thai food horizon Watch this spaceIve never been to Thailand In fact sometimes it seemed as if I was the only one at Edinburgh uni who hadnt spent their Gap Yah there But whilst I may only hav other Thai restaurants in the UK to compare this place to it still ranks pretty highly on my listMainly because of its value for money Being just across the street from the Festival Theatre their Set Lunch and Early Evening menu is largley aimed at theatregoers and so is conviently quick and hasslefree Its also surprisingly extensive Usually on a set menu youd expect to find three or maybe four options for each course but here there were around ten I had the spicy chicken and coconut milk soup for my starter and it was absolutely gorgeous I dread to think how many calories it had in it but whatever the number was it was worth it For my main course I decided to be boing and go for a traditional Thai Red Curry or so Id thought except this one tasted absolutely nothing like supermarket rubbish It was so much more flavoursome and it made me wish I knew the first thing about Thai cooking so that I could go home and replicate these dishes at homeUnfortunately I dont So for now Ill just keep popping back here whenever I need my next lemongrass or coconut milk fix And at less than 10 for 2 courses that might be quite oftenThai Basil is a brilliant place to come if youre looking for delicious authentic Thai food at very reasonable prices Further their service is some of the fastest Ive witnessed with meals taking no longer than ten minutes to arrive  It doesnt look like much from the outside being crammed in between other restaurants but its got far more to offer once you get insideThe menu has a good range of authentic Thai dishes all of which use a wide range of fresh ingredients  I opted for the salt and pepper squid followed by their special green curry  Both were delicious and served in generous portions  The meal only cost about 12 per person which we all thought was excellent value for moneyThai Basil is one of the better restaurants that litter Clerk Street Situated just opposite the Festival Theatre it targets this crowd with the pretheatre menu always seeming very popular whenever Ive been in there Also due to the fact that they are used to dealing with high numbers of people in a short space of time the service is excellent The staff are polite efficient and really speedy exactly what you want Dont be put off by the looks although it appears tiny there is a great atmosphere inside and the food is great The full menu has a huge variety of Thai dishes with good curries and stir fries If however you are on a budget the lunch or pre theatre menu offer excellent food for a reduced price two courses for 6 and 12 respectively and three courses for only a pound more The pad thai is great as is the hot and sour chicken soup Thai food is normally expensive in Edinburgh so it is nice to find a place that doesnt break the bank With good service and great food at affordable prices Thai Basil is a good find Whilst not the best quality dishes around it is certainly a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend it for a cheaper alternativeWhen I ate here last night I realised that the initial 4 stars I gave this place might have been a bit generous I even toyed with the idea of only giving it 2Mainly the atmosphere was awful There was only one other table occupied when we went in at around 7pm and it the whole place was so deathly quiet it gave it a really awkward feel to it We were practically whispering at our table because talking in normal voices felt like we were standing on the table and shoutingThe food wasnt as great as it had been last time either I got the chicken chilli and coconut milk soup to start abut it didnt really taste of anything and the chicken was quite rubbery And its not like the kitchen staff were exactly rushed off their feet either My main wasnt much better the noodles in my Pad Thai were really overcooked which meant they were all slimey and soggy But the thing that annoyed me the most was that the food came so quickly that I find it hard to believe that it was freshly preparedIn fact I am going to change it to 2 stars"

    "review":"Without a reservation on a Saturday night we were able to get a table in one of their dining rooms The staff is incredibly attentive and helpful and worked with us to find the perfect collection of dishes for the different palates around the table I would definitely frequent more often if I was in the neighborhood for frequentlyWent into an empty restaurant and asked for a table near the window Was told nope You can only sit inthe corner  it was an empty restaurant at 945pm on a friggin Monday  I walked out if the service is that bad I didnt want to try the foodBest Indian in Edinburgh love love their rogan gosh lamb my husband ordered other dish which I forgot the name he said that was his new favorite Indian dish Food is pretty fantastic The only thing I am not please is kid unfriendly environment What a pity but anyway as long as food is good I can always order takeawayI enjoy Indian food but find most Indians come with a layer of grease and can often be quite disappointing A friend recommended Lancers so we got together and ordered a takeaway from here I was majorly impressed there is definitely a jump in quality from the standard Indian restaurant and Lancers Brasserie The Samosas were like nothing I had ever tasted before so full of spices and again without that grease that usually comes with a takeaway With neither of us being big eaters we shared the chicken Bryan which we both enjoyed It was enough for two to polish off I have heard that the restaurant is much better and the staff are very friendly although it is maybe a little more expensive than the usual Indian But I think that is because it is that bit betterReally I wanted to go to Mithas but they were closed for refurbishment So I searched on Yelp for a decent alternative and Lancers came up  and good reviews were relatively in abundance Im not 100 sure I ate at the same place as I feel my experience was entirely different Service was beyond rubbish  from forgotten drinks to just being forgotten The hot towels in other reviews Went to other tables bar us I had to give up on the bill and go to the bar to pay where there was no apology or interest and the bill silently shoved at me Service is part of what you pay for and we definitely got a rough deal here The menus should have also been another indicator of care  dirty and stained but I tried to look past that to thinking  Ive heard the food is good so lets focus in on what we came here for In the end all three of us opted for thali In fairness the food was decent  for me the sabzi jalfrezi was the best of the dishes dhal lentils saag paneer tasted very odd Seaweedy odd which was a strange underflavour to the dish and didnt work very well and sabzi jalfrezi vegetable jalfrezi  and not as spicy as I thought a jalfrezi would be The boys enjoyed the lamb offerings in theirs too Our starters were all average to start with with the SR noting that my vegetable pakoras looking like the same that you buy anywhere After an enormously long time the Silent Reviewer reached his breaking point and demanded our desserts  whether any of us wanted them or not  which comprised of some seriously freezer burnt bright orange kulfi I havent had kulfi before but if this is the best then I wouldnt be rushing back  but I suspect this is like the rest of our experience not the norm Perhaps I should have read the other reviews more closely  as the majority praise Lancers take out rather than dining  and the other 4 star is for food and ignores the terrible and similar service Lancers also offer a private dining area  I dread to think what it would be like if you were tucked away from the general public but I for one definitely wont be trying itA couple of weeks ago The Man and I were in the pub and in the mood for a curry  We dont have a goto curry place because most if not all of the places weve tried have been a bit hit or miss or generally just a bit meh  We sought the opinions of those around us in the pub and Lancers was the resounding winner of the pub poll  I hopped on The Mans shiny new iPhone to look up the menu and we chose the lamb jalfrezi and chicken biryani with garlic naan and some odd chicken starter thing they offer delivery but Captain Genius opted to pick it up despite the miserable cold weather :    Im not a lamb eater but ooh man was that jalfrezi amazing  The biryani as well was so so nice though I wish it had come with more sauce because wow was that stuff incredible  The sauces had a proper amount of veg in them as well as nice cuts of meat instead of the usual dodgy stuff and reminded me of a real homemade curry  I was really very impressed with both of our mains though Ill admit the starter was like chicken and foam combined  it had flavour its just the texture was strange  I usually walk away from a curry feeling full and a bit bloated but Lancers dishes were proper nourishing goodnessIve heard that eating in the restaurant takes it up another notch so Ill be definitely be planning an evening here asap"

    "review":"Lescargot Blue the sister restaurant to Queensferry Streets Lescargot Blanc is the most recent winner of the Lists Newcomer of the year award You can see why: not only is it beautifully decorated with huge antiquated posters advertising liqueur alongside simple furnishings and typically French chequer tablecloths but the food is packed full of flavour and expertly cooked I went for lunch and had three courses for 20 You could spend a lot less by only having a main as they are very reasonably priced at 750 each Beware of the evening though as that price rockets upThey do normally have farmhouse apple juice but had run out when I visited so I opted for freshly squeezed orange juice Many restaurants are lazy when it comes to stocking fruit juices so I was impressed by their attention to detail Freshly squeezed orange juice is hard to beat when it comes to fullon flavour and this was a good one The waiter was friendly very attentive and sharp  And the service was very prompt The was fairly basic but tasted good I ordered a side dish of provencale aubergines to  and they were lovely: buttery and very soft For pudding I had a tart tatin which was incredibly boozy In case you are wondering there is nothing wrong with that at all It was approximately 95 percent apple and 5 percent pastry so there wasnt a great deal to soak up the powerful kick of the apple Luckily Im not the greatest fan of pastry and would much rather have a more apple than pastry For some reason it was served with strawberry ice cream which kinda threw me Strawberry and apple dont get along too well thats why Still theres no way that pudding could be called blandI couldnt fault much about the lunch The starter could have been a bit more exciting and the pudding could have done with a different ice cream but considering the value and the quality of the cooking these are small gripes This place really feels like the real deal Theres even an epicerie downstairs selling amazing french produce including cheese meats wine coffee buscuits and bread As a lady near me eloquently pointed out it is quite FrenchHow would one reasonably go about referring a friend to go to Edinburgh in order to eat French food Theyd put you away right Slap on the strait jacket send the wagon your mom will be there to visit in due course But this place is fcking amazing Also how is your most expensive bottle of wine 61 Just a deal  the wife and I hit this place hard for our 6th anniversary and with predinner drinks three appetizers the special and another main plus sticky toffee pudding and a coffee for dessert we only managed to spend 100 How is that possibleDrop everything youre doing and come here Cant say enough good stuff about this placeDelightful to find an authentic French restaurant in Edinburgh Great food great service Loved the canard and the boeuf bourginion Start with a traditional pastis choose a good wine and voil cest la vieLEscargot Bleu delivers In my five visits to this restaurant the consistency of the food service and charming ambiance is its formula for success Dinner with colleagues tonight and the restaurant served a superb meal The steamed mussels were tender and delicious with a fresh taste of the sea with cream and garlic I ordered a steak entrecte served medium rare It was a generous steak rather than a paper thin one The meat was well cooked with a little get crop char The jus complemented the steak Even the purple potatoes and the seasonal vegetable were delicious For dessert I tried the year old plums soaked in Bas vArmagnac syrup Different but good finish to a wonderful meal Highly recommend this restaurant The sister restaurant LEscargot Blanc serves more traditional dishes like Cassoulet Will try it next timeLescargot Bleu was voted the best newcomer of the year in 2009 due to the quality of its service and the range of the ingredients used in the food  Its contemporary French cuisine made from locally sourced Scottish ingredients  They also sell horse meat  Now plenty of people think its some kind of heinous crime to eat horse meat because they like horses   So what if they like horses  Does that mean theyd happily eat a chicken pig or cow because they dont like them  Of course not they just dont fancy the idea of eating a halfdomesticated animal  Man upEverything on the menu is pretty expensive especially the horsemeat but I had the coq au vin which was chicken in a rich red wine sauce  It was delicious but cost about 13  I would certainly come here again as it offers an interesting menu and great service although the prices do match this qualityThe theme here is French twist with the best of Scottish From the decor its hard to see where the Scottish influence is It sent me back to summer holidays in France and the restaurants wed eat in there All the staff are French so you can hear them all speaking French to one another so its easy t forget you are in ScotlandThe food here certainly isnt on the cheap end of the scale but the ingredients are of the highest quality and you can tell by the taste My soup was delicious and this was followed by cassoulet which once again took me right back to my summer holidays when we ate cassoulet at least 5 times a weekGreat experience and a good escape to a French bistro in the heart of the French countryside youll have to squint a little for the French countryside bit"

    "review":"Excellent for lunch or dinner with extremely authentic decorPopular with the local business crowd so prebooking is a mustKnowledgeable  friendly staff make dining here a very pleasant experience  it wont be long before I go backFlawless really Great service excellent food classic setting Looking forward to next time and hoping there is oneVisited here for dinner on a colleagues recommendation last Friday during a one night stay in Edinburgh The place itself is tucked away on a little side street just behind George street lots of lovely pubs It is small candlelit and plays the part of fancy little French bistro in every way Menu can look a little pricey but they have a cafe classics menu which offers two or three courses for a very reasonable 1823 respectively Not as many options but I really enjoyed my meal Starter of smoked beef with sundried tomatoes was light and fresh with a lovely smokey flavour and served with peppery rocket For main I had the venison Shepards pie which was rich gamey with meat that just melted in your mouth Mash topping was smooth and salty with just the right amount of crisp from a good grilling Dessert was a perfect vanilla creme brle  any French restaurant worth its salt should be able to nail this dish and cafe saint honore was no exception Wine selection was varied and quite well priced and staff was quite knowledgable in advising a selection to perfectly match my menu choices Highly advise a visit if you are in Edinburgh Booking recommended :I have always wanted to come here as I have heard so much about them  Very intimate restaurant and tables are spaced comfortably apartI had the trout tartare as a starter  Light refreshing with just amount of seasoning to bring out the wonderful flavour of the trout  My main was the steamed east coast plaice  I dont know how they do it  I have to say wow with a standing ovation  It is the most perfectly cooked fish I have ever eaten  It basically just  melts in your mouth  Even the large prawns are perfectly cooked  Smothered in a creamy Sauce and underneath a bed of vegetable that still retains its crunch  I was in heaven  To finish off I ordered the mint creme brulee  Not the best in Edinburgh I have to say But the starter and main has won my heart so I will let this one go This has got to be one of the highest rated restaurant on my list  Unfortunately I was masturdating yes its a word so I didnt get to see and try other dishes  However I will definitely be back again to try the others  It is just perfectVery nice bistro  Central location but not on the main drag  Starters: cullin skink and beetroot and goat cheese saladBeef steak and salmon for mainsUnpretentious flavors well executed Treacle tart for dessert  Good value for money  Interesting atmosphere  Highly recommendedFunny thing about Edinburgh   some of the best food I had on my trip was at French restaurants and not Scottish  And Cafe Saint Honore was no exceptionLocated a little off the beaten path the address says Thistle Street but its more on an off shoot alley of Thistle but that may be just how they do it here Cafe Saint Honore did it up right for me on my last night in EdinburghThis charming place is quaint mixed with some Old World Charm that makes it the perfect place for a special dinner or date  We sat on the main level in the front room and had both excellent service and excellent foodThe bread comes up warm and crunchy served with fresh butter  The wine list is not huge but large enough where you can find something that is perfect for your evening  It was warm on the night we were there and the house Sauvingon Blanc while a little fruity was quite goodFor my starter I went with the risotto with goats cheese and my friend had the pork rillette  Both were good and very flavorful  I had the sea bream served over vegetables as my entree and my friend went with the lamb  Here again they were cooked perfectly with plenty of contrasting flavorsFor dessert they served something of a deconstructed strawberry shortcake and clotted cream  Delicious  Somehow the berries in Scotland are so much sweeter tasting than the ones I get at homeA lovely restaurant a lovely setting  If you like French food Cafe Saint Honore should be on your list to try"

    "review":"Does Tonic serve the best cocktails in EdinburghI think so Beware It will also break your bank balance A friend kept raving about this place and how he went here after work all the time so I told him to take me in the hope of shutting him up Well all he did was get me fabulously drunk on fantastic cocktails while emptying my bank account The cocktail menu is so varied and long that you spend the whole night reading the menu thinking ooh that sounds nice I think Ill try it And this continues for some time before you realise that its closing time and you can barely walkIf this bar werent quite so pricey there quite simply wouldnt be enough stars on the scale to rate it adequatelyPaying up to 9 for a single drink does take something away from the gorgeousness of the beautifully made works of cocktail art although there is no denying that these bar staff know what theyre doingCall me boring but I went for my staple dirty vodka martini On the basis that I drink them almost everywhere I go I figure thats the fairest way to judge them all it definitely got a thumbsup from me And lets face it its not as if there arent more than enough cocktail emporia on or around George Street Which is why this place deserves its amazing reputation as it stands out from all the others with the sheer quality of the placeI have to say I did feel like a bit of a Sex  The City wannabe sitting there with three of my friends analysing our lovelives and wearing high heels But you sort of end up doing it unintentionally in here with the plush booths goodlooking waiters and tasty tipples And its not just the surroundings that look beautful  ive never seen so many different glasses crazy fruit garnishes and flamboyant colours and wonderful tastes this side of Rio CarnivalJus make sure youre credit cards still got plenty of wiggleroom left on it before you go inTonic concocts some fantastic cocktails this fact cannot be argued The speciality focus of knowledge and reliable quality of this bar is the array of cocktails that can be requested here so whether youre a traditional Cosmopolitan or Mojito sipper or you want something with a bit of an out of the ordinary twist to it Tonic will comply with your beverage supping needs When Im in here depending on what mood my palate is in I usually go for the French Martini which is always pretty awesome or a classic Cosmo apologies if that sounds very unadventurous but it always goes down a treat The inside of the bar is sleek stylish and very well finished so youd be well recommended to visit here if you like to drink your cocktails while looking trendy in a pristine environment It is pricey though as is most of George Street so a few cocktails down and your purse will definitely be less of a weight on your bag Its also pretty miniature which can be nice on weekdays when town is quieter but slightly hard to handle at the weekends when this place is packed with cocktail requestersYes Tonic has the best cocktails in EdinburghIt is a really modest place its really not flash yet always has a brilliant atmosphere To get here you have to go down some stairs and the bar itself is really quite small It can therefore get really uncomfortable when its busy you cant get to the bar and the wait is made twice as long as the waiters are meticulous with their cocktails I once had a cocktail in an actual jam jarMy brothers girlfriend and I spent about 30minutes looking over the extensive menu to decide what we were going to have When we decided we both wanted what the other was having so ended up doing a swapThis is definitely one of the gems in the cityTonic is a coctail bar  and as such adheres to a certain set of rules Some are good and some are bad  lets start with the good1 The cocktails this place does are tasty  really tasty2 The cocktails are made right in front of you with a certain amount of showmanship and outright showing off3 Tonic is small but classy and styling Certainly cool4 The drinks menu has more choice than I can think to describe in a singe metaphore5 Theres a great atmosphere  its a cool trendy vibe but also relaxed and funBut now for the bad1 Expensive 10 for what is effectivly fruit juice and vodka no thanks2 Because Tonic is small it gets busy and uncomfortable quickly3 Waiting 7 hours for a drink while the barman shakes and stirs and filters and mixes and flips it all about while singing mama mia is not coolSo there you have it a great little cockatil bar but with some pretty major flaws Ill just have a GTGreat location in town  Table service from knowledgeable bar staff  circa 79 per cocktail I believe it can get busy at the weekend but we were here on a Monday night and we had our choice of tablesTasty drinks and great music  I would definitely come back here"

    "review":"Peters Yard is a bakerycumcoffee shop on the edge of the Quartermile development It bills itself as a Swedish artisan baker selling freshly baked bread coffees teas and a good selection of cakes and pastries The shopcafe is in a modern building think glass and steel and is very bright airy and Scandinavian There are a few tables and chairs to sit outside on which for once is actually quite a pleasant thing to do as the only traffic going past is skateboarders on their way to Bristo Square The staff look like theyve come to work straight from the set of an American Apparel advert and are uber friendly and helpful So far so lovely Unfortunately all this Scandinavian goodness comes at a price a Scandinavian price so it is not a cheap place to stop for a bite to eat  justifiable on the odd occasion but certainly not everydayI have been craving for cinnamon buns for a while and it was finally time to check out Peters yard one of the most popular bakeries in Burgh Would I come back Yes I feel pretty satisfied with Peters yard except for one thing: I wish I could eat them warm like fresh out of the oven next timeLove this wee gem of a place Its tucked away which means its quiter than their bigger shopcafe at Quartermile I am head over heels for their mango sorbet I could eat it all day Sunshine in a pot whether the sun is really out or not They have a few sorbets  lots of interesting ice cream flavours that Id love to try damn you lactose intoleranceAlso serves sandwiches  drinks so a great place to grab lunch if youre in the areaheading to the Meadows  want to avoid the queues of the more apparent venues on the main dragI really like Swedish pastries and this place was calling out to me whenever I passed it on the way to the theatre everyday Decided to stop in after a day that required much needed caffeine I noticed that there were people ordering their pizza It looked amazing so the next day I came back with two friends and we ordered two pies to share It was so delicious Ive been living in a country where good pizza is hard to find and missed NYstyle pizza I was definitely happy to be digging into this pizza I even came back to get a pie the last few days of my three week stint during the festival Get the Parma ham pizza you wont be disappointed I also had the chocolate coconut ball but it was ridiculously tough to bite into so I wouldnt recommend it Stick to coffee tea pizza and the sandwiches I thought they looked goodAlways seems to be an attractive place for brunchlunch with its bright open feel in the middle of the meadows However I always find myself unimpressed with the selection for brunch and you have to be lucky to get a sandwich at lunch as when they sell out at 2pm they may refuse to make moreI still love Peters Yard Even though the number of stars has plummeted for me I do But they have a new policy A new policy thats really quite annoying So they opened another Peters Yard behind the old one not that old one Its specifically for Takeaways Because of this new Peters Yard takeaway theyve decided that during lunchtime youre not allowed to get takeaway coffee from the older Peters Yard Which you know would be fair enough IF all you were getting was coffee But I was getting a takeaway coffee a chocolate ball and a slice of pizza I was hungover and was trying to cure myself on my way to work The takeaway part didnt have the latter two So they decided to make me go out to the other Peters Yard get a coffee there to then come back and get everything else there Instead of just making me a coffee on the spot I mean there wasnt even a queue: it was just a matter of following rules without rhyme or reason And so the plummet I hope they decide to change this new policy because it is both angering and stupid Im off Peters Yard now And my pocket is happier this way"

    "review":"Despite working nearly opposite Pep  Fodder for the first 4 months of its existence I had never noticed it before Oops And since moving jobs Ive not been up Waterloo Place way for a while or at least not in search of food But this Saturday after a stroll up Calton Hill and in desire of some lunch and a cup of tea my boyfriend and I strolled past and thought Yep that place looks nice and it wasThe decors lovely the lime green tiles particularly and they were playing a Beatles bestof FAB The chap who seemed to be in charge was very friendly to everyone and not just us which really makes you feel appreciated as a customer I was asked twice how my soup wasI had a breakfast tea and their soup of the day carrot and corriander which was served in a mug with a slice of bread Ive been trying to cut down on starchy carbs but couldnt resist the bread mmm My boyfriend ordered a mocha which was served in a little glass cup Sweet  Price wise it came to less than 7 which wasnt too badId agree with previous reviews that comment on the selection available or lack thereof only one soup and teas listed as Breakfast and Herbals I assume if you enquire further they have several as I spotted an Eteaket sign but its not obvious Oh and whilst the breakfast menu looks decent it was strangely lacking in eggsBut its a nice cafe and perfectly located for a quick pickmeup after visiting Calton Hill and if Im in the area again Ill pop by for a brewPopped in to avoid a freak snow storm and also get a warm drink Lovely chilled vibe with a simple but nice menu to give you the right foods to keep you going Ended up getting one of the best Hot Chocolates so good I ended up getting a second straight away Visit  02012015 BrunchThis place is small and subtle in the bustling heart of Edinburgh but its definitely worth a visit I popped in for a quick lunch one day and had a delicious soup with a big chunk of bread There is of course an excellent selection of sandwiches and cakes as well and all with friendly helpful staffUnfortunately the small size means seating is limited and we had to sit outside on a chilly afternoon However Im sure this is an excellent takeaway option if you livework nearby :From the second we walked in I instantly fell in love with the decor and cosiness of this cafe and loved the diagrams of what makes each different type of coffee above their menu boardI originally ordered the porridge with compote but they were out and so had to settle for porridge with honey 250 instead It was not a tough decision as the cold weather outside called for a warm and filling breakfast dish To go with my porridge I ordered a tea 180 and choose the Scottish Breakfast option from their tea selection It tasted similar to many other teas I have tried and I cannot say that any flavour stood out to me I ended up needing some help to finish the porridge as it was quite a dense and filling portion however it was very delicious and S my travel companion for my Scottish road trip enjoyed it also S for his breakfast had a latte 255 and pain au chocolate 150 to go with it he liked both and had no complaints about eitherThe staff at the counter were friendly and easy to chat with even with the constant stream of customers coming into the cafe The cafe was pretty much filled the entire time we were there along with a stream of people doing take away orders showing that it is a popular cafe in the area Overall I enjoyed my meal and would happily recommend it to anyone in Edinburgh and looking for a friendly delicious and very reasonably priced meal for breakfastReally am a fan of this placeI especially like their visual depiction of the different types of coffeeA very friendly staff and some good pastries as wellNice location on the Royal Milegreat addition to the central cafe scene  I work nearby and despair of Starbucks etc  PF provides a nice relaxed space with great food and coffee and friendly service  I feel strongly about the need to support such places but this is a place that I would come to anyway because its great  I thought the pastries were fresh  The paninis were interesting and packed with flavour  Above all for me the benchmark great flat white"

    "review":"Gusto definitely changed my opinion on Italian restaurants Until I ate here I was of the opinion that to be good an italian eatery had to be cheap  cheerful and a bit rough round the edges and absolutely not part of a national chain Gusto meets neither of these criteria and yet its definitely one of the best restaurants in the George Street areaI went midweek for dinner and was surprised at how busy it was Deceptively large once inside the opulent dcor and subtle lighting makes it perfect for an intimate dinner for two yet the buzzing ambience and fashionable air of the place would also make it an ideal place to start a night outThe food was lovely if slightly pricey However i loved the fact that they have a Healthy Living Menu  i could still eat out but didnt have to go to the gym the next day and both courses were bursting with flavour which is usually a rare find among Lighter Options However for those not watching their figure my partners 28Day Aged Premium Steak with grilled tomato and fries 1295 looked so good i couldnt help but steal a bit off his plate when he went to the looThe service was spoton attentive and thorough without being intrusive and I didnt have to think twice about whether or not I was going to leave a tipDont miss if youre a student remember to take your snapfax as you get 20 off food prices from the A La Carte menuGusto in George St serves up classic Italian food in a modern and stylish setting it is certainly a cut above most of the city centres other Italian restaurants Given the sheer size of this place you are pretty much either guaranteed a table or a very short wait for one and if you do have to wait it is worth it The tables outside are ideally placed for a spot of people watching and in this area there are generally a few amusing characters passing by to entertain you The food covers all bases in regards to the pizza and pasta offerings that youd expect but throws in a few surprises too: suckling pig anyone The calamari is very good and never chewy or rubbery and the figs ham and mozzarella is a wonderfully simple and tasty dish This is a great place to come with someone fussy theyll find something nice and safe to enjoy  yip they do Bolognese AND Carbonara while you explore the more adventurous parts of the menuI came here on a second date with a guy once and swiftly ordered the French Martini as I had been watching Sex and The City all day It arrived with a huge blueberry in the centre which I thought was a nice touch So nice infact that I then threw the martini all over the girl next to me and smashed my glass Real smoothClumsiness aside I really liked Gustos They have a nice layout with a huge table in the middle to accomodate bigger parties and small booths and intimate tables all around it My mum and I ordered the garlic bread on the side  big mistake It was huge Too big for us to shareI had duck which was cooked to perfection My mum had spaghetti Carbonara which she said was really light and not too much They aways have a decent discount on offer so ask the waiterwaitress for the latest dealsEverything about Gusto is amazing the staff are friendly and attentive the decor is fab the seating is very comfortable and the food is to die for The decor is very fancy with a black and white theme going on and they have comfortable leather booths that can accommodate up to seven diners The dinner menu was extensive which made it a difficult decision when deciding what I wanted I was very surprised as the prices were a lot less than I had anticipated with the average price of a main around 9 I opted for the penne salmon pasta after hearing that it was the best thing ever You know what It was Absolutely delicious with a gorgeous creamy sauce garden peas spinach and a very generous amount of salmon mixed in At first glance it didnt look like a big portion and I was a little worried it wasnt going to fill me up as I was starving I couldnt have been more wrong the portion was rather deceiving and was actually so filling that I struggled to finish it but waste not want not and you really cant justify wasting something that tasty it was amazing We also got a garlic bread pizza side which was amazing and one of my friends got The Griffin pizza and after sampling a slice I can confirm that its definitely up there with the best pizzas everFor dessert I went for the berry mess which was massive and a very reasonable 575 The meringue was delicious and the berries were really sweet and refreshingOverall a fantastic restaurant phenomenal food great surroundings and staff that cannot do enough to help Thumbs upAbsolutely the worst food Ive ever eaten in a restaurant I think Ikea has better meatballs and the tomato sauce tastes like it came out of a jar from the grocery store We also called 3 days in a row for reservations but they said they were fully booked We walked by the restaurant 2 of those nights and the place had many empty tables We stopped in and they reluctantly sat us at a table I wish they hadnt Dont waste your timeBooked here with a large hen do at Christmas and at no point in the booking process we were told we would receive a set menu We arrived on time but our table was not readyWe got to our table and were given a set Christmas menu which we didnt want and were not forewarned about The food we received was good but overpricedWould not return we werent looking for a christmas meal and if wed known wed get lumbered with that menu we wouldnt have picked it"

    "review":"The smell of this baked potato shop drives me crazy You know how some people say that oysters is an aphrodisiac I would argue that the smells wafting out of Tempting Tattie would weaken the knees of the most upstanding gentlemanladyThey have a great selection of fillings  everything you would expect from a baked potato shop The potatoes themselves are nothing short of perfect  exactly how a tattie should be I loved the tuna mayo and sweetcorn its really chilled and so works well with the steamy potato My friend just had cheese and she said it was the best baked potato shed ever hadLet me just tell you Stuart is a fusspot with cheese He tends to boycott some flavours to the point where I once made him a cheese toastie for breakfast last week and he sent it back because I used Kraft cheese slicesSo dont listen to the cheesy lies I quite liked the cheese in here  its not as bad as all that and it melts nicely There are some good old fashioned baked potato toppings you can get including tuna sweetcorn and some Scottish haggis that the tourists will go nuts over While I always opt for minimal fillings I always appreciate how well the potatoes are made in here They crumble in your mouth like yer gran made them Lovely stuff As Stephanie said your nostrils will lead the way since this place smells delectable from around the blockI wouldnt quite call my 2 experiences at Tempting Tattie a case of hit and miss but after my frankly tremendous first baked potato I was a bit miffed that the second wasnt so much tempting as vomitinducingIll start with the good one Unbelievably fluffy inside cooked to perfection with crispy skin and with a generous helping of admittedly a bit rubbery cheddar on the inside Five stars all the wayOn visit number two I opted to be a bit aventurous and put a bit of haggis into the mix Now haggis doesnt look the most attractive at the best of times but this tattie quite literally looked liked a dog had been sick on it It didnt taste too horrific but its perhaps telling that since this menu misstep Ive never felt tempted to returnthats what you get for mixing haggis and cheddar cheese Once the memory of that schoolboy error fades Ill gladly give Tempting Tattie another goGavins got this one right the cheese is that cheap stuff that all cafes usually use for toasties Melted its fine unmelted youd be safer chewing on a sockOne detail that usually wouldnt be a problem in any other take away but cheese holds everything together in a good baked potato A good cheese might have made up for dodgy haggis Gavin hadLets be honest weve all been tempted by a tattieTempting tattie aims to exploit your primeval urge for filled baked potato This is a better than average easy lunch option Like the many sandwich and baguette shops that have sprung up the idea here is to choose your own filling from a wide range Here you can choose a small medium or large portion costing you around 350 420 or 500 respectively Whilst there is a wide range of preselected combinations basically of two ingredients you can also choose to creatively construct your very own tattieAmongst the other reviewers there seems to be a bit of a debate on the issue of cheese I have to say I wasnt that impressed by it either Im quite picky about my dairy and I really dont like megaprocessed plastic cheese with a greasy film Unfortunately Ive come to expect it from most placesBut you dont really expect fine cuisine from a shop like Tempting Tattie so if a quick filling and reasonably priced potato is your cup of tea try this placeIncidentally they do also offer cheaper than average but decent paninis and mediocre soup so its not all tatties at TattiesCheap basic filling goodBut jesus dont get a medium Its enough food to choke a hungry hungyr hippo It was 2 quite sizeable potatoesIm honestly not so sold on putting some of those things tuna  sweetcorn really in a potato but you can get just about anything in a potato And nothing else And its cheap filling and you can get a nice pint down the Waverley a minutes  walk away Yay"

    "review":"Food and service are great The scallop is about to beat Gordon Ramsays  will definitely return Have visited riverlife a number of times and Ive always left a very happy and satisfied customer Food is delicious very flavoursome and the staff are lovely very friendly Its a 10 out of 10 for meI visited Riverlife a couple months ago for their nine  course French Provenale banquet on offer  We booked midweek and the restaurant was pretty dead  There was only a family of 4 and us in the place so there wasnt much atmosphere but I guess it is a bit off the beaten track in Dalry and relatively unknown The interior was quite plain cheap and a little dull so first impressions didnt fill me with excitement  There was some confusion over the booking and the waitress said there maybe some wait between course as the chef was not prepared for the 9 course banquet however it wasnt noticeable and the time waiting was filled while drinking our BYOB red wine with free corkage Our starters included seafood bisque which was very creamy and tasty so far so good Our second starter was warm goats cheese salad also delicious and plate was scraped clean  So far the starters had been served on separate plates so I expected the following courses to be the same but instead next 5 courses were presented on one large long dish to share  There was two of each seared fillet of sea bass rib eye steak rack of lamb confit duck leg and pork scallops  The sauces used on each meat were all very similar a red wine gravy however the seabass had a lovely garlic butter sauce in its own small dish  The other meats however were a bit gristly and of poor quality  These meats were eaten along side a plate each of caramelised sun blush tomato red onion tarte tatin dauphinois potatoes and vegetables  Then came our dessert a lemon tart very sickly sweet and a selection of cheeses to share  Although we were already full after the previous 7 course the desserts portions were very small and uneventful  So generally the meal was enjoyable and we rolled out of the restaurant will our bellies full but I wont return for the 9 course banquet maybe try something else from the menu instead  The overall bill was very reasonable due to the BYOBGood unpretentious French Caribbean fare served in a cosy and welcoming atmosphere by friendly folk BYOB too so a visit here is never going to break the bankEveryone who was there on the night we visited could have done without the loud drunk table of three blokes in the corner although they were at least just camply bothersome rather than actively offensive and you could have an issue like that anywhereWe were her on an voucher for a French 3 course mealThe service was efficient very friendly and welcoming The meal however was more an hit and missThe starter of warm goats cheese was not warm The Blue cheese filled button breaded mushrooms were not tasting of blue cheeseThe jerk chicken breast was a little dry but the sauce was excellent however it was all on my wifes plate because I opted for the duck The duck was tasty but not very well prepared No crispy skin and could have been less chewy The cherries were very pleasantDessert: creme brulee And it was crack yeah and not too runny yeah x 2 but not hot or even warm enough boohThe coffee was so so I can only conclude that the chef is good but missing refinement The sauces and additions were spot on the meats and the flavours need work We will be back to see if anything has changedA group of 7 of us went last night for a wonderful birthday dinner As a vegetarian I was hesitant because there arent HEAPS of vegetarian options to be precise there are 2 vegi main course optionsThe staff were wonderful very friendly and helpful They brought out fresh bread before our mains came which was lovely because we didnt order starters Also we took great advantage of the BYOB with no corkageOur mains came everyone ordered something different but everything was beautifully presented My mushroom and lentil fricassee was divine everyone else seemed happy with theirsThere was a hen do in at another table and a guy who worked there started playing guitar for a wee sing along with them at the end of the night We thoroughly enjoyed this especially when he then came over to us to sing happy birthday to my friendIts not in my end of town and I wouldnt have considered going there before but I am extremely keen to go back"

    "review":"Marks and Spencer Simply Food in Waverley Station is pretty much the only place to get food before you board a train: Boots is always far too busy WH Smith is expensive and for some reason I dont trust the Pasty Shop or Upper Crust There is a decent range of sandwiches and salads in here and the staff do a good job of keeping the shelves well stocked I quite often pop in on my way home from workuni to take advantage of the reduced items I usually manage to pick up some sushi for about 1 bargain As there are about eight till points even if there is a queue you get served quickly  which is of paramount importance if youve got a train to catch I dont get my travel scran from anywhere else nowMarks and Spencer know very well how to do food My boyfriend and I love coming here and finding deals which are actually deals ie discounts on yummy products Keep your eyes peeled for the dine for 2 for 10 pounds  a personal favourite where you get to choose a starter main dessert and bottle of wine for a tenner Also what is neat is that you dont have to really know how to cook to enjoy a lot of MS food: its geared to the general British public who either dont have the time or simply dont know how to cook things like ham or make exotic dinner nibbitsMarks and Spencer boast excellent food quality This particular store being the biggest in the centre often makes it very busy and because its in the basement  it can often feel a bit cramped and oppressiveTheir food also comes with a bit of a price  hence my joy when I find a discount To sum up: a great British department store with a good selection of groceries that are famous for their qualityWell you cant say that it doesnt deliver what it promises Its Marks  Spencer Simply Food It simply sells food from Marks and Spencer SimpleActually its a bit cleverer than that  this particular shop is in the middle of Waverly train station and it genuinly offers an alternative to the fast food and burgers that litter the station Its not cheap and a sandwich is after all just a sandwich  but if you are looking to stock up on your way home its actually a great place to grab some foodAlways good for a quick fresh biteI like this place a lot This is my backup to the MS on Princes Street when I an unable to get there before they close which happens more than I would like due to my crazy schedule Located at Waverley Train Station this is a good place to stop in if you want a sandwich or need some quick groceries They have most of the items I want and so I actually stop in and pick up things like milk and oranges on a semiregular basis Also their fruit selection is still better than Tesco in my view and this isnt even a full MS That speaks volumes However being in a train station there are times when this location gets super busy Long queues but even then the cashiers do what they can to move it along pretty quickly so that isnt a big deal to me They do also keep longer hours which is a great convenience to me Overall they are a bit more pricey than the standard MS but Im ok with that because they are open longer than most shops I cant really think of too many negatives at this store They have everything I need good fruit selection and competent staff members who are always stocking shelves Cant beat that Also getting in and out of Waverley is easy for me so I will definitely be backYelp has prompted me to write this review as I left a useful quick tip apparently on the App Yey go me I have to admit M  S wasnt top of my review list and I hadnt even remembered it to review it But thats a bit of a shame given that I go here every time Im in Waverley Train Station without failWhether its picking up breakfast and lunch for a train journey down to London or getting off the train after a short or long journey and needing a quick dinner you can nip in here to get great microwave or oven meals that are qood quality I love their Simply Fuller Longer range It does exactly what it says on the tin Meals can be around 350  450 calories and fill you up all night a perfect healthy dinnerI sometimes even go out of my way to come to the station just to nip into this MS to get lunch or dinner MS is second to my mums cooking as comfort foodThis MS is small but perfectly formed Its got all the essentials lots of deli meats and a few ingredients raw meats vegetables for you to make your own dinner too MS isn the pricier of the supermarkets and for things like veg and meat its probably too high for what youre getting but their microwave meals really are delicious  a whole level above other supermarket dinners and Id say worth the price"

    "review":"Yum Yum probably makes my favorite shawarma But its also the priciest of the late night kebab places I venture to and also kind of out of the way for me at least so I rarely ever go hereThe staff are friendly and the ingredients taste fresh Cant go wrong with Yum Yum especially after a night of drinkingOne star is generous This place was overpriced and overrated They couldnt wrap the kebab and eventually just folded it in half in a paper wrapper for me so it fell apart after one bite The chili sauce was like mild Tostitos salsa and there were no veggies It tasted bad and cost almost 7 pounds The service was terrible DO NOT GO HEREI happened upon this place during the Fringe I was hungry after my show I needed falafel inside my face and I was in the area It was late in the evening so Yum Yum seemed like as good an option as any place The prices are decent and the ingredients looked fresh so Lets GoAs a vegetarian I was not tempted by any of the other options than Falafel but thats okay I dont think I would have been when I was a meateater either See I have a problem with any fast food place that can sell such immense heaps of meat for a few quid I think of the animals that meat came from and while I dont care what BIT of the animal is used etc I doubt very much that this is free range organic to put it that way But thats to be expected from these sorts of places and its not something Im marking Yum Yum onThe falafel was tasty Not the tastiest Ive had but tasty The sauces were nice and the wrap was absolutely full of veggies I love eating something like that and feel like Im actually putting a good mix of nutrients into my body Its a quick reasonably healthy fix of energy and its tasty Can you really ask for moreOkay you want more Well how about sitting inside and enjoying yourself while tourists haul their suitcases up the stairs in the rain moaning and complaining All the while not realising that they could have just gone up Cockburn street instead I dont think Ill ever tire of it myselfThis place has moved to George IV Bridge unless its a second outlet as well as the Cockburn Street one But what you need to know about Yum Yum is that they do the best falafel wrap in EdinburghI realise that thats a bit like saying that someone is the best blues guitarist in Kazakhstan but to those of us who love a good falafel wrap Yum Yum is the place to go because of the level of service youll get Most people seem to go there late at night in search of lambfilled pitas to soak up booze but I went there on a weekday lunchtime starving after getting up early with a baby and I asked for a falafel wrapWhat followed amounted almost to an interrogation into my personal preferences for garnish but I ended up with the single most delicious and generouslypacked falafel pitta I think he misheard me about the whole wrap thing that I have ever held in my hands The falafel were crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle the pickled cabbage was sharp spicy and crunchy the hummus was earthy and garlicky the other salads were various the sauces were perfectly judged and the whole thing was a justification if you needed one for never eating meat again I am not a vegetarian but on contemplating food as good as this Im temptedYum Yum This place holds a special spot in my oft drunken heartAfter a long night out as most nights are in Scotlandif youre doing things right that is I would routinely found myself in need of a falafelDonner as one does but had no idea where to start my quest for greasy nirvana Now if you dont know not all chip shops are created equally they all lure you in with the heavenly aroma only triple fried meat and potato can make but few live up to the hype You could  try one of the small ones on Rose Street or stand in line with tourists  on the Mile but youll end up with basically the same level of food it will absolutely get the job done trust me but wont leave you super happy If youre looking for something that is better than average Yum Yum is the answer I personally like the one on George 4th Bridge but the other one which Ive only been to in a fog couldnt tell you the address was also quite good The guys running the place got to know us over the week we were there good thingnot sure lol and were very friendly every time we showed up Walking in you wont find a lot of space to sit which was AOK with us as we were on our way home every time we stopped by The place next door painted red cant remember the name is huge and also smells heavenlybut the guys are rude the food is meh and the extra seating allows youths to sitloiter for extended periods of time thanks but no thanks  Speaking of food Yum Yum is spot on I recommend the Donner and chips but the pizza is good as are the pies and fish Seriously you cant get hurt at Yum YumIf you find yourself out past last call in this amazing city and need some Donner to soak up some of the party you just drank down look to Yum Yum for the hook up Just a side note chip shops like this should only be visited in the wee hours of the morning if this is your main stop for lunch youre doing Edinburgh wrong This is a lie if you eat here too often you will most definitely die of a heart attackbut hey we only live once right"

    "review":"If possible I would rate this restaurant 0 stars The food was subpar as the noodles were soggy and the chicken tasted like dirt But worse than the food itself was the wait staff They were absolutely incompetent When paying for my meal they automatically converted my bill to US dollars at an extremely high and incorrect conversion rate I asked to pay in pounds instead and they told me it was impossible and they wouldnt do it I asked them to then cancel my charge to pay another way and they said that was impossible as well I will never be going back to this restaurant and advise you to stay awayExcellent taste Not expensive Costeffective I will recommend my friends to eat hereGreat food and nice service Really recommended if you like Asian food Tried wok noodle with chicken and bean sauce and it was simply delicious Open until late so its a good choice for a late night dinnerUpdated review: No matter how cheap this place is the last time I visited it the food was much worse and for some reason they didnt accept cards so we had to go by in the neighborhood to withdraw some money Also the fact that they bring forks to caucasian people and chopsticks to asian people had become very bothering Still the 3 for the good past experience but I was disappointedI concur with most reviews here and so I try to keep it short It was my 4th time in 6 weeks that I went to this Noodle Bar The highlights:1  Price: Cheapest in central Edinburgh eg Starter Chicen Wings  Noodle  coke was 10 Pounds2 Variety: Around 100 different items to choose from Menu very organised and categorised indicating which is spicy and which is veg and from which country each dish originates and what type of pastarice they have and if wet or dry etc etc etc  its not that much a hit and miss as in other cuisines  Btw dont expect Pizza and Burgers though3  Speed of service: Drinks within a minute Starter 5 mins Main course 10mins often I have not yet finished my starter but I am not picky on this4  Location: Very central in South Bridge close to Biblos and Cow gate5  Environment: Always with lots of people if lucky you get the sofas6  Food quality: Very delicious all four times I was satisfied Once I tried the chicken with Lemon Sauce  wonderful7  Portions : Noodles Rice Pasta etc abundant very filling 8  Green tea free of charge Never heard in EdinburghWhat can be improvedThe service is not always 4star and maybe the management needs to have more Scottish waiters with that extra smile and courtesy  of get the asian ones including the management some tutorials of service for UK customers They waiters seem to suffer with chaosattack when there is a lot of people kinda confused  Dont expect a set table and for astrange reason the cutlery is always one napkin and one fork wheres the knife Bruce Lee It is a very popular Noodle Bar and always full of people during peak hours and weekends and fringe festival so it is not forthgranted you find place to sit immediatelyI havent tried the heavy dishes meat fish duck and set menus etc but I am quite sure that are also deliciousIf they just improve the service and can find a way to make the place larger it would have more fivestars Highly recommended I am going again to try a wet noodle dish from what Ive seen the size of a facewashing basinbowlWe visited this place midday Instead of haggis or coffee with shortbread something Asian style We were not disappointed fast service and fair prices Shortly after placing the order we got our dishes Sure we are from Germany and in one instance more guessed what we have ordered lacking some vocabulary but it was all good The only missing points for a five star review the chairs are something worn out and the fast delivered and freshly cooked noodle dish was a little bit to greasy"

    "review":"I remember this place used to always be really busy I dont know whats happened Nothing has really changed As usual the staff are great A few authentic Italian voices are a welcome change They are very attentive and the waiter that we had last time didnt catch the name very tall cant miss was cracking jokes all night Time to get back here people dont let this place go downGiulianos is another Italian restaurant on Leith Walk and this one is probably the most popular  Im not too sure why however as my experience in this place didnt really stand up to that of the others in the area  It looks inviting and stylish from the outside and the interior decor is also contemporary and comfortable  The menu has the usual pizzas bruschettas and pasta dishes as well as some tempting deserts like their homemade tiramisu  I went for the pepperoni pizza which tasted pretty good when it arrived some forty mintues after I ordered it  Also it was barely warm when it arrived and the last few mouthfuls were coldThe place is virtually always busy but even so the staff just dont seem to care  I douibt Ill be back here again but plenty of locals seem to visit reguarly so it must be doing something rightYou really cant go wrong with Giulianos if youre looking for some hearty Italian scran or a pre theatre munchThis used to be our port of call when me and my friends were coming through to see Edinburgh shows I first experienced this place in early 2003 which is becoming a terrifyingly long time ago now However this place hasnt changed a bit in that time Rather than seem old its rather comforting that it has largely remained the same why fix it if it aint brokeAnyway Ive always had tasty snacks in here We have always been caught on the hop when seeing a show but takeaway service was prompt It looks like an equally nice place to sit in and the quality of food and service is great Like Dinos in Glasgow it manages to fill the position of both a place to get a quick bite to eat and a full blown place to sit down and have a meal I have never been disappointed and I daresay Ill be back next time Im seeing a show at the PlayhouseFantistic visit  We stayed across the street at The Glasshouse Hotel and the hotel recommended this restaurant for our family dinner The restaurant was quite busy and for a busy Saturday night they were able to get us a table with no waiting  The food is fantastic  I expected good Italian but got extraordinary Italian This familyrun business prides on service and good food made with quality ingredients  We enjoyed our meal and the stellar service We would come back againWe went to see Oliver while we in Edinburgh but did not dine before the show We walked out of the playhouse and directly across the street was Giulianos  At first it looked like any pizza parlor but after getting thru the front and seated we discovered it was a full fledge restaurantWe had pizza anyway  It was very good  The menu looked great the other diners appeared to be regulars who were enjoying themselves  I would go back if I was ever in EdinburghI love Italian food and there is plenty to be had in Edinburgh  When I heard Giulianos did glutenfree pizza I thought it would be a great opportunity to try it as I had a friend visiting from Canada with gluten allergies  So four of us went were greeted by friendly staff and were promptly shown to our tableThe restaurant itself has a pleasantly tacky decor trying to emulate what I would imagine to be Italian sculptures photos of Italian scenery and copious vine leaves Despite the cheese I did enjoy it for what it wasThey have a pretty extensive menu with a variety of salads antipasto pasta pizza and traditional Italian dishes  My friend and I decided on the red house wine and our partners got glasses of Peroni  This was when our waiter eventually decided to come overThe service from our experience is what really let this place down While there were a number of servers there that seemed keen and attentive our waiter was the better part of uninterested in us  While we were pouring over the menu another couple sat down beside us After waiting for about 510 minutes without having even been greeted at their table they left  The front of house could not understand why they left and I felt like telling him it was because the waiter they had on our particular section was rubbish  He finally came to our table to take our drink orders and when we eventually got to put in our food order it was very promptly brought to the table However he did not once check if we needed anything else or if we even wanted water and we found it difficult to get his attention  Now I am not the type of person that expects a waiter to be at your table every 5 seconds asking if things are OK because that is also undesirable  However when they take ages just to even acknowledge you are there or offer a drink then dont even check later on to see how your meal is doing I think its unacceptable  On to the food Our guests raved about the Caesar salad and it did look quite nice so I did wish that I tried it  For my main I had a mushroom ravioli  While you got a big portion and it was nice enough it was slightly mushy and not hot just kind of luke warm  But it was fine and I ate it all  My friends glutenfree pizza looked nice as did the lasagne and canalonni type dish my partner had  The food overall was fine not excellent but certainly satisfactory even though Ive had much betterGiulianos is fine if you are looking for a quick Italian meal with a bit of Italian cheesefactor thrown in in terms of the decor the happy birthday shenanegins they dim the lights and play music then sing and the overall atmosphere  The prices arent too bad and the house red is nice  In terms of Italian restaurants overall in Edinburgh though this is not one I would hurry back to I found the food to be slightly subpar although edible and the fact that our waiter could just not be bothered are deterrents  But I would recommend people try it for themselves if they are remotely interested in going I would probably suggest Vittorias or La Favourita as excellent alternatives though"

    "review":"Ate here on a dummy run for a party booked later in the year We arrived at 7pm on a Friday night to a cavernous slightly daunting empty space saved only by the smiling staff and the most delicious aromas wafting aroundAs we sat drinking our wine the restaurant is byob bring a screwtop or your own corkscrew and eating our way through some of the tastiest lamb ever the tables around us began to fill Actually we lingered so long over our meal that these tables filled emptied and filled again And never not once were we made to feel unwelcome or rushed 5 hours we were there a personal bestThe food wasnt bad but it was way too expensive for the quality It was all pretty decent pretty bland but nothing was bad It was all an eh experience overall Mostly price wasnt worth itLOVE LOVE LOVE Hanams Its a restaurant in a central location just by the castle and you can smell the mouthwatering food from outside The decor transports you to the Middle East the moment you walk in Staff are polite and pleasant Theres a seating area upstairs and downstairs Its a spacious restaurant which also has a balcony for the summer months where you can have shisha The food is always of great consistent quality and it never disappoints I find it very difficult finding Middle Eastern food that I like and approve and this is the only one I always visit in Edinburgh Recommended starters: hummus fatoush baba ghanoush cheese borek halloumi soujuk mixed dolma Love the freshly cooked warm naan My personal fave main is the baly merishke kebab grilled chicken wings hmmmThe baklawa is average sometimes sweet and crunchy sometimes soggy Wouldnt go here for dessert Nevertheless Its one of my favourite places to eat in EdinburghOverall love the place highly recommendedConvenient location and nice surroundings Restaurant was quiet as it was early on a Thursday evening so it was slightly lacking in atmosphere although it was getting busier as we left We were a group of 8 and they were happy to accommodate Everyone enjoyed their meals I ordered a falafel wrap with halloumi added but was served the wrap and a halloumi starter The wrap was flavourful and had a good array of spices The filling was well distributed and I left full The only slight gripe I had was that the halloumi was charged as a separate starter at 550 which I felt was steep for 3 small piecesFabulous  Everything about this place was the best The hummus and naan were to die for  Mixed kebab was minced lamb being the highlight  Falafelwas great alittle dryDont miss this restaurant It really stands out but especially in Edinburgh  Decor beautifulFriendly and excellent service very professional  Balcony on lower level availableDoesnt serve alcohol and we didnt  bring a bottle but looked like many customers did If I lived in Edinburgh Id be a regular customerDELICIOUS is all I can say Never ate in a Kurdish restaurant before although this place is Kurdish  Mid eastern The flavors are wonderful  potent The naan bread to die for  VERY fresh too Service excellent Atmosphere very pleasant We sat inside but they do have outdoor seating as well Highly recommended"

    "review":"Surprising nice atmosphere in a location loaded with choices including the block but by luck and a little craving steak tonight got me hereNamed after the scottish highland cattle they took light in the fact with nice humorous decor   The service was friendly and promptThe drink menu was plenty with locals hanging out there for just thatbut the dinner was wonderfulWe had excellent steak on the board shared with my girl nice sides of potato chips english style onion rings and very good green beans all spiced rightThe meat cut was cooked as we requested and just the right amount and a good tender cut of beefThe bread on a board was a good lead for us with a scallop starterAll around us seemed to be happy with the excellent foodFor steak check this out and maybe even if you have the seafood steak need between a group   Enjoy the view up on a nice view on the second floor over a prominent cornerEnjoy EdinburghTo its menu vibe and intense decor this place is all about beef Suggest not coming here if you are a vegetarian Despite this joints perhaps overly passionate cow obsession kyloe served me one of the best steaks Ive ever had Its not a place to come to if you are starving and want a huge chunk of meat but it is a wonderfully tasty dinner filled with various flavors as there is a variety of cuts rubs marinades and sides to choose from Although our meal was a wee bit pricy the food did by no means disappoint and Im proud to say my short horn sirloin was awesome Suggest coming here if you are visiting EdinburghAfter receiving rave reviews from the hotel staff the actual event was a disappointment Reservations were tight  had to settle for 5:30 or 9:30  but I went with 5:30 on the strength of recommendations Service was inconsistent with intervals of excellent service scattered among long periods of neglect The actual food was fair to good but far from extraordinary In particular the quality of the meat did not live up to my overblown expectations of the legendary Scottish Angus beef Ill try again ElsewhereStumbled into Kyloe by mistake thinking it was The Huxley However we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food Oysters were deliciously and expertly shucked Celeriac soup was a little on the bland side Steaks were pretty much perfectThe current 4 star average rating is far too generous for this restaurant  The food was of a reasonable standard  the staff are friendly  helpful but the time between placing an order  receiving food was far longer than one would normally expectThey seriously need to do something about the little black fruit flies I noted other yelpers have mentioned before  theres nothing more distracting or off putting when trying to swat them away from a nice glass of red wine or off your foodWe went on the back of steak cravings and its close proximity Spent the evening us 2 women in a room 95 occupied by male clients the majority of whom looked to be on expense accounts The toilets are unisex with 3 marked for male and 3 for female yet all had seats up and wee everywhere  another strong indicator of the main demographic of customer herenot the best experience going for a wee holding the door open for 3 men leaving shoving their shirts down their trousersThe clear market target shouldnt have anything to do with the service or product they provide but it is so difficult to ignore While we had a few issues with our experience a large table of men on a business dinner nearby had bigger issues and we witnessed such fires being put out there all evening We didnt make our problems known at the time because a we were only halfheartedly asked since most attention was levelled at that big table and b we felt slightly sorry for our server She was clearly relatively new and not trained properly enough to be equipped with the right answers to general questions This made her nervous and any support for her was invisible to us No points lost because of her and I wont list her mistakes because she did her best and was sweet Failures came from elsewhere Our starters were lovely though it became immediately apparent the actual table surface was a problem because every plate and glass wobbled like mad on every bit of it even more so when cutting food or putting forks in Really irritating actually and spoiled our enjoyment for all the food all nightMy MR fillet was 2 seconds from WD and quite tasteless I never put mustard on meat but I did this time because I wanted a flavour I didnt send it back because I didnt want to wait any longer But a 29 fillet should be looked after by a chef So cheeky The blue cheese and red wine sauce at 2extra in a tiny wee pot was just unpleasant A jus with very tiny whiteish globules in it which could have been blue cheese but were certainly not detectable as such  looked and tasted exactly like my partners bone marrow gravy My partner was also not too happy with her sauce and her R sirloin upgraded by alomst 10 to more aged meat on servers rec was M Chips were ok but again not many of them in a camping cup for 3 extra The server struggled to tell us the cheeses a training issue and they were fridge cold and horrible for a good while before we could actually taste them I just think that it is fine to charge these prices for steaks cooked well and charge extra for veg sauce and carb and charge a lot for starters and charge a lot for every little thing if the service is polished and cool and good and the food is memorably mouthwatering and delicious All we got was the high price and a bill no way reflecting our experience Wont rush back"

    "review":"This is a cool restaurant where you get a big cooking pot and you cook the meat for however or as short as you want You sit at a table where you put the pot on a big hob and a member of staff fills your pot up with hot boiling water The pot is partitioned meaning that you can have your own meats being cooked separately from your companions The concept is really cool and I have never experienced it before and I think it worked really well The restaurant is really great the choice of food is huge and you can get an all you can eat within 2 hours for 15 which is pretty decent however bear in mind that you have to cook your food meaning you dont et 2 hours straight of all you can eat The staff are more than happy to help you order and there are set ingredients that you can order if you dont feel like creating your own dishI would love to give this place five stars but I cant as I cant help but feel that you are some how getting ripped off by having to cook your own dinner even though thats the whole conceptTo be honest the food there is not very clean all the food you ordered is in one big plate no matter it is seafood or vegetables In addition the tables are greasy They still charged 2 pounds for 2 persons set I felt sick in half eating but continued to finish The waiter was nice but the hot pot was really not tasty I will give it 40 out of 100Pros: the quality of the food is decent good variety of sauces Cons: too small bad ventilation service is hectic but especially: the hot pot broth is tasteless Your food need to cook in that broth to get tasty This broth made our food tastelessLove the concept of hot pot  you pick your broth you pick your items then you pop said items in to the broth until theyre cooked at which point you fish them out and deposit them in your mouthThis place was great fun Dont go with people youre not happy to share food with as youll be fishing out of the same broth Also go with an open mind and prepared to try new foods  who knew rice cakes were so good Or tofu skins1599 gets you all you can eat over 2 hours The service is friendly and enthusiastic if sometimes a little disjointed Everything we had was tasty and fresh  what more can you ask forThis is easily my favourite Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh  Its hugely popular with the local Chinese community who flock here every night of the week because the food is just so authentic  When I first came here it was unlike any other dining experience Ive had  The reason its got Hotpot in the name is because they stick a steaming cauldron of salted broth in front of you and you then order raw ingredients which you then cook inside it  Now surely this defeats the point of going out for a meal but its actually a great concept  Its a lot easier than it sounds and you just stick in whatever you think might work they offer recommendations  and then eat it when you think its ready  I went for chicken with lemongrass chilli and coriander which was actually really tasty and didnt take as long as I expected for it to cook  They have a very plush wine list and some seriously stylish decor inside  However it certainly isnt pretensious and its a great place to come for a meal off the beaten trackMy friends and I had such a fun night at the Xiangbala Hotpot and I feel a little stingy to award an aok 3 stars but although theres no doubt that we enjoyed our evening we were all in agreement that the ingredients and the restaurants facilities could be improvedWe opted for the 15 menu and we were given a ticksheet of broths  foods that wed like to try We selected almost everything on the list including edible fungus pickled chicken claws and tealeaf eggs There were lots of lovely fresh veggies and the king prawns were delicious but the cooked meats were quite dry and some of the other items werent the bestFor sauces  dips theres a single table so that customers can help themselves and for us it was quite tricky to work out what was what other than the large carton marked MSG  we avoided that one It would be nice if the restaurant could provide each table with their own selection of condiments insteadCooking our own food was great and Id recommend the experience to other friends who have no fear of trying new things Ill definitely try hotpot restaurants again but will probably not return to Xiangbala"

    "review":"The Orchard in Canonmills is handily placed for a nice drink or something to eat if youve been walking around the Botanic gardens It is a relatively quiet and friendly neighbourhood pub with a regularly changing Scottish based menu featuring classic dishes like fish and chips although here they call it deep fried angel cut haddock with hand cut roosters Between 123pm they do a selection of fresh gourmet sandwiches on ciabatta and these are rather good The crayfish tails with coriander and lime mayo was an inspired filling idea and tasted lovely it came served on a slate with some salad and a good sized pile of kettle chips  well worth 6 It is worth mentioning that they do table service so even if youre only in for a couple of drinks you need not get up from your seat  make sure you keep a tally of the bill though as it is very easy to let it spiral out of control when youre not paying as you goI have been with my class mates several times in this bar close to the botanics and I agree with previous posters which gave 45 stars The have very good ales a warm friendly ambience a good selection of food tried and was very satisfied with the burgers and a steak stew Pie  and very cosy and large You can easily spend an entire evening with friends or partner having a dinner and the fuel up with alcohol  Sometimes it is too crowded early so that is the only small negative i can think of but it is a trend of all good pubsLocated on Interleith Row a short walk away from the Edinburgh Royal Botanical Garden  After touring the gardens all morning The Orchard was a welcome stop for a pint and a bite to eatThe servers were busy with the lunch crowd but managed to be friendly and helpful  Our pints and food arrived without delayThe pint of Deuchars IPA was creamy  refreshing  We tried two ciabatta sandwiches  Our first selection was Brie bacon cranberry  mixed greens  Very tasty and satisfying  Our second selection was the pulled pork with an apple relish which was good but I preferred the Brie ciabattaNice atmosphere clean and tidy tasty food and helpful servers  What else could one ask for from a pub  Give it a try after touring the gardens you wont be disappointedGreat lunch spot after the botanic gardens Chicken stuffed with brie and apples wrapped in prosciutto was tasty  Crispy Scottish pork belly was excellentWe were staying around the corner and were very hungry and ready for a nice pub meal The meals we received exceeded our expectations The service was lovely placing our group of eight on a table with no worries when we hadnt even booked I ordered the steak and Merlot pie which was delicious although so hot it burnt my mouth Everybody else was very satisfied with their meals too For dessert I highly recommend the brownie which was served warm and gooey with yummy icecream and strawberries It was also great to have a friendly kiwi waitress who shared our understanding of the language used down underTo be honest this is either 35 or 4 stars not sure but it serviced the need so Ill go with 4 stars as the service was nice and most of what we had was good  Stopped here on the way to the botanical gardens a perfect location for catching tourists  The selection of ales is a bit on the low side but they do have a variety of lagers and bigger name brand things  So if that is what you are looking for this place will work  I had the bacon burger which was actually very good  The DC had the smoked mackerel and the soup of the day  The soup was a winner but no point in describing it since it will be different by the time you go there  The smoked mackerel was tasty but the issue was with the bread and the greens that came with it  The fish spread was good and smoky but the bread that came with it was a bit over done   The ratio of spread to bread is a bit off and youll end up eating the spread straight when the bread runs out  Service was good as I said  Just a little off to make a solid 4 stars but worth a try and see what you think  Might be there on a day where they dont burn the toast"

    "review":"Ended up here at 10pm because everything else was closed An underwhelming Italian with undercooked calzone and soggy spaghetti On the positive side it was only 30 for two people including some of their house wine Overall I wont be back if I can avoid itTaking its name from the most famous of land marks whose shadow it sits in Il Castello is a dissapointment from the moment you walk inDespite being recently redecorated the outside still seems shabby and already the place is starting to look as though it could do with a lick of paint on the inside As we arrived we were greeted by a surly waiter who communicated soley in grunts and then promptly forgot about us It took almost 20 mins to get a seat in a deserted restaurantThe menu is huge so there is little chance of finding something you dislike  but the food itself was on the tasteless side despite being well pricedOverall Il Castello wont be somewhere I will be frequentingJust a quick dinner Not very enjoy it because I HATE the waitress here Will this make me look so mean Never mind I am mean okayI beg to differ  Had a very nice experience here  I had the sea bass fresh herbs and lemon nicely done  Husband asked for a dish not on the menu and it was prepared just as he asked  Also a nice panna cotta with good texture  And good espresso  Friendly service as wellSituated right next door to the esteemed Castle Terrace Il Castello offers the standard menu of Italian classics My starter wasnt particularly great but the main course of lamb cutlets was really good Its very reasonably priced and the staff are friendly welcoming and knowledgeableOverall we said: I rather enjoyed Il Castello Their take on melanzane wasnt for me but that aside it strikes me as a very reliable friendly little place And whats more their espresso was so good that I had a second one Next time youre in the environs pop in for a warm welcome and good Italian fareNothing else was available in the area a we were hungry We decided to go into this place The service was average bit slow considering that the restaurant wasnt busy The food wasnt good enough We ordered calamari as starter and the oil for this fried maybe was too old The main dish was disappointed for all of us The portions small the pasta typical of discount supermarket For 14 pounds you can get an small piece of lamb with chips I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone"

    "review":"A great little deli cafe Relish is ideal for getting that quick bite to eat at lunch time or a morning coffee Located near the water of Leith and on Commercial Street Relish provides freshly made sandwiches homemade soups and a selection of hot drinks Furthermore it provides a wide range of cheeses meats and Italian themed foods including olives I have been there a few times and on both times the food has been excellent and defiantly represents value for money The soup and bread combo does not cost much more than two or three pounds the tomato basil soup I tasted was warm and tasty However if you want a bit more to eat I can also advise upon the sandwiches I had a baguette with cheese salami Milano and a red onion salad Again it was great and very filling as wellI would certainly visit Relish again and I am envious of the people of Leith for having such a good deli cafeSigh I would have to discover here in January my month of abstinence: An amazing wee deli will a large wine and beer selection Well worth checking out :My review is basically based on a short visit to this cafedeli placeWe ordered their daily soup which was Thai vegetable and it was absolutely lovely Spicy nice seasoned and quite fresh They have a quite good selection of wine and cheesesAlso we found our favourite tortillas chips in there which was handfulWould definitely come back and try their salads that looked quite nice tooThe Shore in Leith is constantly being heralded as the new centre of Edinburgh for foodies and the existence of Relish right here seems to corroborate thisIts a fairly highend deli where you can go for a sophisticated kind of sandwich or light lunch or else do some gourmet shopping  they stock a range of cheeses pickles fancylooking vegetables and the like  Its a little pricey but seems less so when you consider what the equivalent kind of shop would charge you somewhere like New Town  And if you know your Roquefort from your Dolcelatte then youll recognise that Relish is a place of qualityGrabbed lunch from here today a CRAYFISH with lemon  paprika mayo wrap ummm a Deli that will sell me crayfish for lunch Yes please Why is this place not closer to MY placeAlso grabbed a bag of Buffalo Wing flavoured pretzel chips yes you read that right BUFFALO WING pretzel chips Aside from those morsels of deliciousness they had a selection of other sandwiches in the fridge or you could make your own from the counter Deli part seems well stocked though I didnt have too much time to look around Also have a good selection of cheeses as wellTheres a few seats inside if you want to sit in I chose to take my food and sit out in the sun by the ShoreWhen I moved to Leith there was a part of me that regarded this as similar to being the dark sid eof the moon A place where nothing grows that food was most likely in doner form and that a deli was a corner shopHow wrong I wasRelish is a great example of this and has become a lifesaver for me having lost Peckhams etc from my life Great selection of wines cheese and all other key favourites has amde this a must visit on pretty much a weekly basisAs noted for a coffee and a crossant it makes a great Sunday stop as well as it does for those well that was a helld of day lets get cracked into some wine momentsAll in all a must visit for Leithers"

    "review":"Finally a proper Vietnamese place in Edinburgh This small restaurant of only five tables has focussed on some some typical Vietnamese street food staples On my visited I we shared a plate if spring rolls which in true Vietnamese style were pleasantly crunchy with a minced pork and crab meat filling For mains I opted for Pho the benchmark by which any Vietnamese place will be judged as far as Im concerned My partner had the Vietnamese fried rice The Pho Bo did not dissapoint The broth was both tasty and aromatic and the beef tender I would like to have seen it accompanied with a bigger side plate of herbs and a bottle of chilli sauce left on the table rather than a small dipping sauce size portion Tailoring Pho to your own personal taste is half the fun The fried rice didnt seem any different from any other fried rice dish The menu also covered chicken rice porridge curries various noodle soups fish and fried noodle dishes Certainly enough to make this diner want to make a second visit On my visit someone picked up some takeaway which is great if youve not been lucky enough to get a table All in all its a great addition to the Edinburgh Asian dining scene If they get some Vietnamese beer and get rid of the elevator muzak then Ill be a happy manLove this place The restaurant is small but the waitstaff treat every customer like a regular which makes me feel a part of the family Its a great place to go alone for a bowl of pho great veg option available or in a group of friends The place is BOYB only so come preparedBeef Ho fun is my favourite clear broth chewy flat rice noodle fresh ingredients and the most important soft medium beef Slices The place is small but well decorated traditional Vietnamese painting feeling warm and welcome My wife order chicken curry rice and for starter prawn spring roll and pork spring roll The prawn Spring rolls are fresh and light the pork Spring roll are crispy and meatyFinishing with lotus hot teaThe pho was pretty good given that it is Edinburgh The broth was different than the authentic Vietnamese pho broth that I have had on many occasions in Vietnamese communities however it is still good Summer rolls were fresh and delicious The ambience was great and tables clean The wait staff were attentive and very nice I would recommend if youre in the area and crave noodlesphoWhat a nice Vietnamese food  Fish cake is delicious Spring roll definitely try  Beef rice noodle is real Vietnamese taste  Love it  Will come againThe pho here is so good Just so so good Its one of those meals that you get it in your head you want it then you fixate on it then you finally get it And its everything you imagined it to be Magic The spring rolls and rice paper rolls are a must try too Service was great if you plan or going with a group or even during the usual busy times it would be a good idea to book ahead"

    "review":"Anita booked the table early in the evening so it wasnt too busy And as we had a voucher When dont weeh we were in for a treat Or so we thought When we arrived in the small restaurant I was advised that I could hang my coat over there OK Thanks On seating we noticed the waiter  owner being quite nervous or flustered It looked like he was well under pressure quite stressed out or having a cold turkey He was drinking a lot of water rushing from table to table in and out of the kitchen It made me feel a bit edgy I couldnt relax as he and his fiddling nervous ways were pretty much unavoidable in such a small place This went on like this during the whole meal so my review will reflect this Instead of bread  butter we got served a taster on a chopping board squared pizza pieces Later we noticed this was supposed to be served with olives we never got those The menu was printed on two sheets of paper we were then quickly advised that we could order up to 20 pp from the menu and a glass of wine The steak was 19  and he was off before I could ask for waterSo in addition we had a sharing platter of antipasti to start with This was a little underwhelming tasteless The wine was OK Vino Verde red house wine 125 ml I managed to get water when he served the wine We both ordered the steak medium rare This was served with a potato croquette and green beans The sauce was a red wine jus with mushrooms It all tasted just as unimaginative as the above description The steak was cooked medium always tricky depending on the cooks interpretation of medium rare  the taste was like eating liver well this may mean it was aged but as that wasnt specified on the menu it may just mean a bad piece of meat  If it was specifically aged it would have been a selling point  like 21 or 35 days hung in a humidor  in this instance the steak was dry and off taste The jussauce was a pleasant well made and tasty  The whirl winded waiter dropped several pieces of cutlery a croquette and a glass during our visit It was a distraction in fact his whole presence was distracting I did not fully enjoyed it it affected my pleasure of speaking to my wife during the meal the food and the whole of the ambience was dragged down with it I just felt like yelling to him:  CHILL the F OUT Man  but I didnt We ate paid and leftThis is a really nice restaurant I stumbled across it by accident The food is great authentic Italian food and the service is friendly We had an antipasti to share as they are quite large for a solostarter It was a platter of Italian prosciutto salami and delicious cheeses As a main dish I had a simple but very tasty pizza magarita Also the atmospher is nice And the prices are more than reasonable considering what you getA very small and easily overlooked restaurant a little outside the city centre but it offers you a very good Italian dining experience in a very cozy little dining roomFirst time at Veritas renamed with a new chef on board Beautiful and cosy hideaway perfect for a intimate candlelit dinner with partners or in my case friends I thought the portions were a little small at first but the homemade ravioli that I had was so full of flavour and did fill me up after all Very competitive price for such personable service and delicious food The White chocolate cheesecake is to die for Ill definitely eat here againDelicious food and cozy atmosphere Felt like I was in a small NYC restaurant on the Upper East Side"

    "review":"This is actually my 3rd visit here The first was for a surprise birthday party and the food was OK Not great Service was slow The 2nd was on a girls night out The food was again OK  kebabs were a bit dry and the fish smelt so fishy we had to send it back and they kindly brought us something else This visit i went on a lunch date with my husband who has coeliacs  gluten allergy  I had a KGBDeals voucher for a 3 course meal for 2 The waitress either didnt understand or didnt care when i pointed out my husbands allergy and brought us a predecided platter of starters  no explanation as to what was what  along with bread that touched the food  When I mentioned the glutenwheat problem the waitress said well you can eat the bread he doesnt have to  My husband asked for rice instead and got a perfunctory there will be rice on the platter We werent told what we were going to get in our meal or given a menu of the meal Nothing After the starters the main meal came and as the waitress cleared the starter dishes i again said please dont bring anything with wheat my husband is allergic  to emphasise the importance of there being no wheatgluten The main platter was kebabs lamb and chicken grill and chicken wings All covered in cooked thin noodles At this point I just gave up The kebabs were moist The chicken was great The baklava and turkish delight were spot on The potato and tomato curry sauce was fantastic But if you have a food allergy dont go hereI must admit I wasnt too sure about Nawroz at first it just looked too big to really be that good I know really poor reasoning eh but thats how I roll On the positive side the idea of checking out Kurdish and Afghani cuisine was always going to win out over my initial misgivings and indeed it was a definite winner The service was lovely and polite the food outstandingly delicious The sea bass bar the bones acting like a jailer to the delicious fish flesh below was just phenomenal I had some mighty tasting courgettes kulakeh and lucky for me the silent reviewer had lamb skewers which allowed him a vegetable side which he picked to be tapsi the other option I swithered about The lamb was proclaimed to be tender and melting the tapsi aubergine dish was perfect and the naan light and crispy Couldnt ask for anything more I heart Nawroz and will definitely return hopefully soon perhaps tonight if I can swing it :Naroz is a very relaxed place for lunch with a really good lunch deal of 7 for two courses or 10 for three Monday to Friday For starter you have the choice of different dips including hummus baba ganoush with bread or falafel or fattoush For mains the options that we tried were shawarmas chicken and lamb were on the menu kebab again both chicken and lab were options and a falafel wrap All the food that we had was freshly prepared and tasted great Our accompanying 18 month old tried pretty much everything and other than rejecting tzatziki enjoyed most of it One minor thing is that the child seats dont have seat belts or other ways of making sure that the small person couldnt stand upThe service wasnt excellent but for a relaxed not too rushed lunch it was perfect We still managed two courses well within an hour and probably could have managed coffee too if wed wanted to We didnt try it but they do shisha in a variety of flavours including Irn Bru FlavouredNawroz is definitely worth a visit particularly at lunchtime with their excellent 7 for two course 10 for three courses dealOverall we said: I was impressed by Nawroz It offered accurately prepared well presented dishes with good quality ingredients for an extremely reasonable price In fact it was exactly what I expected Id get from Illegal Jacks the other day Funnily enough my bill in Jacks and the bill for the two of us today were almost exactly the same amount I think well be back to visit Nawroz again soon particularly as it fits the profile for one of our Sunday refuelling stops very nicelyThis place which is BYOB has a deal for a set menu for 32 for two You get masses of food and the ice cream is amazing Definitely worth a visitI have a short review on this because it concurs with the other reviews I was very happy to went trying Kurdish Cuisine at Nawroz The menu has many options to choose from and have a special charcoal grilled menu which at around 13pounds you get a big nam rice or salad a good portion of meat and a free additional side plate Since I am fan of Okra I took that as a side portion and  they were cooked in really good slightly spice sauce which you can add onto the rice  The main point I wanted to put forward is that the food is cooked and spiced quite different from the European way so you get a real experience that you are eating something differentOn the other hand I have to say that the place do not sell any alcoholic drinks but it did not effect me as I often taken water However I made an exception and took Mango juice and was a very good Between 4 and 5 stars I am giving 5 becasue the place is large clean and the staff very friendly We were served by a tall Czech waiter who was chatty and took good care of us"

    "review":"I love my chinese food  so I always jump at the chance to go and review a chinese restaurant We chose this place because of its excellent happy hour deal something which seems to be amiss throughout the areas chinese restaurants However even without the happy hour deals I would venture this place is a pretty low budget night out as it is This is reflected in the quality and taste of the food  its not the best I have ever had and one of my dining companions questioned what type of meat was in his dish more than once However as I mentioned this place is cheap and you get what you pay for  something not to great but filling and cheapI am inclined to agree with the previous reviewers This place isnt bad by any means but it also lacks anything to make it stand out from the crowd of similar restaurants dotting the area From the outside it does not seem particularly appealing  It is painted a dull green and generally struck me as on the verge of merging into the background never to be seen again Luckily the interior seems a lot more brighter It manages to have a slight degree of elegance while keeping very simple although I can imagine that others would find it bland compared to the vibrancy of other Chinese restaurantsThe prices arent that great either  While the takeaway seems fairly standard the sit in menu seems a tad bit too pricey  This is rectified by the Happy Hour deal as mentioned previously  2 courses for 950 isnt bad at all  However this deal only applies to a set menu of dishes marking the foundation of Chinese cuisine such as Lemon Chicken and Chow Mein I can imagine that to the more experienced Chinese diner these options would seem rather constricting The service was good and I did not feel like I had been waiting too long for my meal If you happen to be in the area and cant be bothered venturing elsewhere then this is by no means a bad option However I wouldnt go to any particular effort to dine here especially if you are somewhat of a Chinese cuisine enthusiastAnother chinese restaurant in Corstorphine really  I camt actually believe that between the townspeople all of Corstorphines Chinese reataurants are frequented enough to keep them going but apparantly they are so here comes yet another Chinese restaurant review  This one is cheaper than pther Chinese restaursnts nearby and provides a variety of set menus as well as the usual menu  I can particularly recommend the lemon tea as a pre mid or post dinner beverage as it livens the palette and is sure to rouse you after stuffing your bellySomething Peach Garden supplies that the other restaurants dont is Happy Hour from 5pm till 7pm Sunday to Friday where 2 courses are 950 and 3 courses come in at 1150  If not much else its certainly value for money"

    "review":"I was very surprised by Passage to India I was given an extremely warm welcome by the manager and he pulled the chair out for my girlfriend touch of old school classI ordered the Chicken Shashlik on a recommendation and I wasnt disappointed Big chunky kebabs marinated in a mild curry sauce with safron infused rice HeavenThe best part was the price both of us ate for 20 and we got 2 glasses of wine on the houseAs a rule I tend to find you can judge an Indian restaurant by the smell when you first walk in This useful tip has come in very handy more than once I have found and I am proud to say my nose didnt let me down for Passage to India My mouth was watering by the time I had sat down at my table and had ordered my drink with the most friendly staff member I had ever met  he was funny helpful and just all round niceThe food was certainly not a dissapointment  my lamb masskai was beautiful and all the sundries we had ordered were just as good The price was also pretty good  with 4 of us dining for around 12 each which was the cherry on top of an already good cakeThe thing which first attracted my mates and I to Passage to India was its name and original sign  This place is definitely not just any ordinary restaurant and I would even go so far as to say that it is flawless  From the moment we walked in we were greeted like old friends by one of the friendliest waiters Ive ever met  The decor is stylish and unique and the tasbles all seem perfectly placed to give a comfortable atmosphere  The menu is extensive and has a good range of kormas tandoori specials and other authentic Indian dishesI ordered the Lamb Tikka plain rice and a naan which all arrived pretty quickly and tasted incredible  The sauce was amazingly creamy and had a good blend of spices whilst the lamb was clearly of the best quality  We each spent about 1350 on a great filling meal and some real Indian beer  I would recommend Passage to India any day for both impeccable food and servicePassage to India is just another curry house serving up dishes with muddled flavors that wont excite you  Paratha was a bit dense and came to the table when I was half way through my curryI did a curry tour of Edinburgh while I was there on holiday See I eat curry and spicy food like NOBODYs business  I eat food so hot that Ive literally watched others cry over a mere taste at my food So I decided to hit a different Indian joint each night while I was in the city in search of the most flavorful and spiciest curryThis place was pretty good The staff were more interested in chatting with each other than serving which Im not opposed to as a rule but it wasnt the most welcoming atmosphere Also the prices were a bit higher than I expected which sort of put me off And since Im complaining my request for the dish to be extra extra spicy was obviously not taken seriously because I couldve poured my meal into my eyes and it wouldnt have hurt That aside the atmosphere was very elegant and simultaneously welcoming which was nice And the food WAS very delicious Im not sure Ive ever had a tastier dal lentil dish than the one I had here That I had to bring my own Thai Chile Peppers to add even a zest of spice was unfortunate but the chefs ability to bring out subtle flavor was extremely impressive  redeeming in and of itself So not Edinburghs spiciest curry and never going to come close but it sure tasted good"

    "review":"Went for the first time today The gentleman who served me looked bored and gave me one word answers with no manners The Pizza had great hallmarks however I could tell both slices had been sitting in the air for a while as they were dry With nicer service and fresher pizza this could be a great place to goIf Pizza Mafia was located anywhere other than the absolutely desperate Princes Mall youd have heard a lot about it by now Their pizza slices are tasty and cheap and the service is very friendly Worth a visit and very handy for when you getting on or off a train at Waverley stationOverall we said: if youre looking for quick tasty and cheerily cheap in the city centre you will be amply served by popping to Pizza Mafia I was heartily impressed with the herby goodness of their pizza slices Ill definitely be backPizza Mafia is situated in the Waverley mall on the approach to Edinburgh Waverley Station 2 massive slices of pizza and a bottle of water for a fiver It wasnt too badBut the pizza was not the best pizza Ive had The cheese was too greasy and salty the tomato was not all that tasty and the crust felt fried as opposed to baked I must also admit I was eating from this place less than a week after the pizza off so my taste buds may have gotten used to a higher level of qualityThe girl at the counter was friendly and courteous However that alone and the competitive pricing is not enough The quality has to be there I dont know based on this experience whether I will return here again"

    "review":"This place might sound like a cheap and nasty greaseball of a fast  food place trying to give the illusion of home comfort but its actually got some pretty good tasty food on offer  Surprisingly very little of their chicken is actually fried setting them apart from KFC and most of it is grilled or barbecued  Their chicken burgers are delicious and this is because the burgers themselves are made with 100 chicken breast  Obviously the batter have a whole bunch of fat and salt in it but the actual meat inside is good stuff  I had a Mighty Box which is a chicken burger a side fries some fried chicken and a drink for under a fiver  I love Ribena and they thankfully were able to throw this into the deal instead of the usual bloating coke  This is a great alternative to KFC in terms of price quality and lack of greaseFast food tends to means fast death Places like Chicken Cottage see to that Cheap chicken that in life was so far removed from its natural environment and filled with so much crap we can hardly say it was alive enough for us to kill it Top that off with some extra grease sugar and salt and youre onto a winner Thats why it tastes good after allI suppose the appeal of Chicken Cottage is that its so convenient and relatively cheap Im glad these places havent taken off in the same way here as they have in the US where getting a chicken meal is actually cheaper than making your own food to the detriment of the poor I didnt even find the interior of Chicken Cottage very appealing it was quite dirty and not particularly welcomingIf you want quick cheap stomach filling nay bursting food and you dont really care where your food came fromwhere its going then Chicken Cottage might still have some appealAs much as I try I cant sink my teeth into Chicken Cottage at allThey are always situated in downtrodden areas which dont endear them to me and although this one isnt in the worst part of Edinburgh I cant shake that image This branch is well kept and looks a bit nicer from the outside but I still remain a bit wary of the foodChicken Cottage sells fast food at its fastest and with that you know what to expect Ive never had a horrible meal from here since its cooked properly and its cheap so its better value for money than the likes of McDonalds but even then its not my favourite place to go Its not a relfection on the staff in this particfular branch and I admire the way this franchise started out from humble beginnings in London But I just cant warm to it which is a matter of taste I guess Not bad if youre looking for something ultra cheap quick and easy but its a poor mans KFC with a hint of gloom about it I dont know if its because their shops seem to pop up in sketchy areas but at the end of the day its just another fast food placeThe meat is halal though which at least offers something a bit different that McDonalds and KFC cantKentucky FriedsomethingChicken Cottages are starting to pop up everywhere these days and Im not sure if thats a good idea I curiously popped into this branch the other day looking for something different I had previously tried Halal meat before and wasnt keen but then again that was plastered in sweet BBQ sauce and served with fries The food is good for what it is cheap fast food It doesnt taste any different from anything Colonel Sanders Fills a hole and makes you feel bloated when youre done PerfectThe only thing Ill say is that the hygiene is terrible Tables were sticky spills were left on the floor and the toilets where only heroes dare to venture insideThis place could compete with KFC if they buy a Mop"

    "review":"Khushis has recently moved here from Victoria Street and its easy to see why its doing so wellYes its true that Edinburgh has more than its fair share of easyonthepennies indian restaurants to choose from but this place definitely ranks among the better ones Even just from walking past the door the smell alone makes you hungryIt mainly caters for groups of students  its the obvious choice for sports teams on their nights out or birthday meals largely because they dont charge any corkage for bringing your own wine and beer spirits arent allowed If youre not boozing then you have to try their homemade fruit juice creations I went for the Cucumber Mint and Rock Salt and although it sounds more than a little bit weird it was actually really tasty The carrot and orange was a close second placeThe starters will set you back 35 each and you could do a lot worse than the Sunhari Jhinga king prawns fried in spiced batter crispy and amazing The mains range from 712 although theyre not hugely imaginative  all the predictable dishes youd expect to find on the menu in an Indian place Being predictable however doesnt stop them from being deliciousI was walking around looking for something to eat Didnt matter where but I wanted something good I found this place and looked it up on Yelp Was not disappointedOrdered the chicken tikka masala and it was amazing Had a side of basmati rice and garlic naan Wait staff was attentive and friendly Downside no wifi but I would go back in a heartbeatVisiting from California we came across Khushis as we wandered around the city  The pakoras were great and flavorful but the three veggie mains we had were spicy hot but otherwise bland  The service was inconsistent and impatient its a bustling place  We asked for advice from the waiter on the size of the portions yet still ended up with too much food  Perhaps it is popular because they let you byob at no charge  So if I lived here I might give it another try but I would imagine there are better options for Indian foodLamb Kahrahi was amazing Very busy night during Hogmanay week yet we got seated quicker than originally stated Garlic naan was excellent While they dont serve alcohol they do allow BYOB and will supply glassesIn yet another incarnation Khushis is now on the site of what was previously an Italian called Massimos whilst the burnt out branch on Victoria Street is on the market Having only ever eaten in the defunct one once about 6 years ago comparisons are probably pointless but one thing that did strike me was that the range of dishes available seems to be smaller nowadays I imagine you could get a vindaloo if you asked for one but that and a few other types of curry dont feature on the menu it seems so you might want to try elsewhere if in search of something particularly hot Possibly thats a sign of authenticity Either way the party of 6 I was in with on Saturday past had no complaints about our respective dishes the knowledgeable  speedy service or the highly sensible policy of not charging for corkage Not maybe the place to go for a quiet and intimate tete a tete but you could do a lot worse in most other aspectsDelicious food  Everything was simply amazing and the prices were reasonable  Be careful the food is spicy but we ate every bite  When we were there in May 2015 they did not have a liquor license but you could bring your own with no corkage fee  A bit of a walk from the royal mile but well worth the trek"

    "review":"Stumbled across pig in a poke whilst out for lunch hadnt noticed it before Concept is pretty simple the main ingredient is pulled pork  you can pick up a roll with choice of sauce for 350 or soup and roll for 550 which is a great price Would definitely recommend the food the pork was moist and the stuffing and crackling is worth getting the only draw back I had was that the service could have been quicker and more organised particulary at lunch time I ordered soup but they had just ran out and needed to heat moreI had already payed for soup so decided to wait the 5 mins until new soup was heated after waiting several minutes I was then told that the soup I had ordered wasnt the one being heated up but a curried soupdont like currygutted Ended up getting money back for soup as didnt have time to wait againSo in totalfood is good and well worth checking outId definitely go there againjust hope its a bit better organisedI feel a bit meh about this place I want to give them a second chance  maybe they were having a bad day when I went on or maybe I wasSimple concept  pig shredded pork in a poke or a rollwrap I opted for the roll We were offered stuffing and sauce but I was left a little baffled by the menu and not sure if I could ask for things like cracking apple sauce coleslaw etc because they were on the board but I wasnt offered them Also slightly baffled by the server who jokingly shook his head when I tried to order a roll like Id ask for the wrong thing or said it in the wrong way shrugSo what I got was slightly dry pork and stuffing on a roll The pork tasted okay but is like to try it properly with something to add moisture to the whole thingAh wellNot sure what  Pig in a Poke  means but I will tell you I ate it like a pig eating slop It was really really good and I was happy like a pig in the mud Haha ok enough with the pig puns and such  this place was really good I happened to trot on by the other day and went on in The place is in a very good location to get the tourists and the locals such as myself Well it was feeding time for me so I decided to get some porker in a tortilla role with the BBQ sauce and some crackling  For the price I was impressed it was cheaper then what I usually pay and the BBQ sauce was not bad at all The gentleman and lady who served me were very polite and cheerful They asked me where I was from so I went through my routine I am from Seattle Yadda Yadda Yadda and who would a thought the gentleman said his boss called up and told him that if your Canadian or American you got a free size upgrade since it was Thanksgiving  Didnt know Canada celebrated Thanksgiving So that was very nice of them and made my day Pork itself was nice and tender perfectly well balanced moister not to wet but not to dry reminded me of mexican carnitas  that use a similar style of pork  I will be back again for feeding time and have my  Pig in a poke I was walking along Rose street and almost half a block away I could smell meaty goodness I drew closer and saw a staff member carving up pulled pork meat The other thing I noticed was that the ABoard showed very reasonable prices and that the meat is oven cooked for 18 hoursI also noticed the not for profit coffee and plug points for charging phonesThe woman was very friendly and ran the shop solo This was quite a feat considering how busy the shop got I was lured in with the smells and won over with the food I bought a pulled pork wrap with crackling I had chilli hot sauce and cheese Basic but yummyHot on the heels of my review of oink I came across this new addition to Rose St at the weekendPig In a Poke is a new trendy looking upmarket version of its competition with some space for dining and lots of cool wood panellingWith a selection of rolls to choose from these guys also give you a slightly wider choice when in comes to toppings I went for the braised red cabbage and apple sauce and darn gosh if it want just a damn tasty rollMy one critique of oink has been their ever edging upwards pricethese guys are going to keep them honest For a sizeable roll they are charging 380 making it a very affordable lunch time option for workersPig in a Poke comes highly Jd RecommendedWhen Jurgens review of Pig in a Poke came up on my feed I immediately thought Im having some of that And I did Lunchtime came and off I popped to Rose Street conveniently only a few minutes walk from my work place and sought out some delicious pulled porkAnd did it live up to the first glowing review Yes Id say it did Its cheaper than Oink although the portion size was a little smaller This isnt necessarily a bad thing though as the Oink rolls can be a struggle to finish The pork itself is very good maybe not as good as Oinks but still pretty tasty and as Jurgen says in his review theres a wider selection of condiments to go with your pork Today there was apple sauce bbq sauce and coleslaw Im a coleslaw fiend so I couldnt see beyond that and it was a good choice as the slightly tangy crunchy slaw complimented the soft yielding pork very well Theres also a choice of breads  a white roll a crusty wholemeal and a flour wrap if thats your thingMy only criticism would be that the serving of coleslaw was a bit mean as was the crackling I was given That and I feared for my teeth when eating the cracklingPig in a Poke very nearly gets 5 stars and in many respects surpasses its main rival But not quite It is however great value for money and close to my work something that neither of the Oinks are so I can foresee this becoming a regular lunchtime treat"

    "review":"Currently closed for refurbishment this KFC holds a special place in my heartWhen my boyfriend and I first started dating we would go out and get very drunk and spend the next day hungover in bed Around 8 oclock we would drag ourselves out of bed and go here for a bucket We would take said bucket home and set up an ironing board as a table and eat off the ironing board while watching a movie This bucket was meant for 4 people yet we always managed to polish it offIsnt that romanticDid you know that there are three types of gravy at KFC It depends what the manager chooses to sell The first is runny the second is medium and the third thick This KFC does the best gravy in Edinburgh and I think goes with the third option Mmm the third option KFC isnt complete without its heavenly gravy in fact the gravy is what makes the food that tiny bit more bearable because it is actually kind of grossOne time I saw a pregnant girl smoking here That sums up the clientele but you already knew thatThis KFC has recently been refurbished and as such is nice new and shiny  I dont eat KFCs too often but now and again I get the overwhelming urge to devour a family sized bucket to myself Theres nothing more satisfying than a meal from KFC with the chicken wings chunky chips and a side order of beans tooIf Im not feeling particularly peckish Ill just go for one of their 199 boxes or some popcorn chicken which is amazing In fact I could go for some just nowKFC always offers a tasty meal with quick service no materr what time you fancy it  The prolem however is that its a complete rip off  For example their Zinger meals cost about 6 and all you got was a tiny burger some greasy chicken things some chips and a small drink  You could argue that ypour paying for quaity but this is definitely not the case  I invariably feel like gash after one of their meals  Further my hands seem to feel greasy for hours after handling their chicken Nonetheless its still tasty food and their popcorn chicken is undeniably amazing  Their Bargain Buckets arent necessarily a bargain but theyre definitely tasty and filling  In comparison to other fast food restaurants KFC might have the best chicken on offer but it comes at a priceThis KFC has gone up in my estimations after the refurbishment that it has currently undergone but this still doesnt change the fact that the food here is pretty disgustingBefore the refurbishment it looked really rundown and looked like an establishment that would only be frequented by roughians but now it does at least look half respectableIve been there a few times for lunch when my friends have insisted that they wanted to go there and the meals are alright but you dont really get good value for money I usually go for the chicken popcorn and chips and the chicken popcorn always tastes so salty In terms of price the meals are about the same cost as Burger King but not as goodThe franchise have done well to refurbish this KFC on Nicholson Street making it look more reputable But it doesnt take away from the fact that its still a takeaway franchise and one in an area that has its rougher partsIts a small size and does everything it says on the tin Anytime Ive been in or walked by it the queues have been moderate but dealt with quickly so credit to the good staffUnfortunately the people who populate this area at night have also tainted my opinion on this KFC Its nothing to do with the restaurant  if it has the Zinger meal Im there and front of the line  but I am put off eating in here by the morons who vandalise it I feel terrible saying that because its not the restaurants fault in the slightest but the massive window that has been smashed and panned in has been that way for at least a week and it makes me wonder at what intimidating customers hang out around here The clientele have thoughtlessly cheapened the restaurant for me and even though I will stress once again that its nothing to do with KFC it would still cause me to avoid eating in here Yes crime happens everywhere and Im not a snob in any way I just dont fancy my chances against intimidating groups of people who have nothing better to do than abuse othersGood for a takeout and kept as clean as they can but sadly they are going to have to get bouncers on the door to get rid of the drongos Damaging someones property is not big nor is it clever but as much as I would try and see beyond the window its very obvious that its a sign of social deprivation and not modern artgood prices for tasty food They do loads of good deals and you could buy lunch for 99p A average meal is about 299 which Is really good Spacious and loads of seats Doesnt take too long to order Staff are ok Great tasting foodreccomend going"

    "review":"Frankensteins was our funny find for the weekend A very funky bar stretched across three floors we visited on the Saturday night and then when we went back for quick bite to eat on the Sunday night theyd run out of food Festival run out Our waiterbar man was very friendly and accommodating though and found combinations on the menu we could eat The food isnt high quality but the atmosphere and fun isEglise reconvertie en Pub Rien que a a fait frmir Vritable ambiance gothique du 19me sicle On dirait un manoir avec plusieurs tages  thmes La salle principale est truffe dlectrodes et de machines pour alimenter en nergie la bte le monstre de FrankensteinLe restaurant est original les plats sont bons surtout les macaronis au fromage Les cocktails sont bien penss et portent des noms mythiques comme me Frankenstein qui est vert par exemple Vraiment un endroit que je recommande fortement Pour preuve jy suis retourn If you enjoy halloween horror films or themed entertainment  this is a must Swung by on a recommendation from a coworker who said to make sure we were there at midnight Once the clock struck 12:00am a Frankenstein animatronic was lowered from the ceiling with lights smoke and fantastic score Very fun would high recommendOriginally I was going to rate this place at least 4 stars because I loved the environment and the type of music they played Lots of old alternative classic hits and awesome dancing kind of songs and catchy tunes I actually had a great time at the club because it was a lot of american music and things Im used to But then the security guard kicked my friend because she was dancing the way american girls who love music dance And then he kicked her out I thought that was so rude because you cant just kick people Never in America do people kick people it was just rude And I think he should have at least gave her a warning if she may have been dancing inappropriately by respectfully tapping her on the shoulder or something So after our whole group of Americans just left Besides the security guard the place itself was greatOriginally I was going to rate this place at least 4 stars because I loved the environment and the type of music they played Lots of old alternative classic hits and awesome dancing kind of songs and catchy tunes I actually had a great time at the club because it was a lot of american music and things Im used to But then the security guard kicked my friend because she was dancing the way american girls who love music dance And then he kicked her out I thought that was so rude because you cant just kick people Never in America do people kick people it was just rude And I think he should have at least gave her a warning if she may have been dancing inappropriately by respectfully tapping her on the shoulder or something So after our whole group of Americans just left Besides the security guard the place itself was greatWell it isnt bad but Im not sure I would be a regular here I have had the experience of meeting up with classmates at Frankensteins on a few occasions last semester not sure why it keeps getting suggested but in any event I have to say the the decor is remarkable to say the least The fullsize Frankenstein that wakes up and loudly lets you know that it is coming to life as comes down from the ceiling is pretty interesting the first time you see it The second and third time Not so much Like I said it is loud and it WILL interrupt any conversation you are engaged in for several minutes That gets annoyingThe drinks Not so bad My female friends like the cocktails and they make some interesting ones from what it looks like The beer selection is pretty dismal in my view and not the cheapest in town either As the night wears on the music gets continually louder until it is in full club mode That isnt a bad thing necessarily but it is something to note This is not really a Scottish pub by any means There are some local folks who stop in amazingly so it isnt exactly a tourist trap either Something in between I suppose In the end I would only come in if a few friends were stopping in I would not make this the first recommendation to friends who come to visit either But with that being said it is a clean and decent place to chill if you like horrorthemed stuff and dont mind a notsogreat beer selection"

    "review":"Hidden above a busy pub in itself a great place for premeal drinks the New Bell is a modern restaurant in the Newington area of EdinburghThe food is splended with the Guinea Fowl main being a particular hit with me and my fellow diners The staff are friendly and helpful but without being over bearing while we were thrying to enjoy our meal There is also a lunch menu available The New Bell has an informal atmosphere more akin to a small cafe than a restaurant giving it a relaxed and friendly vibe over allAt the end of the night I was more than suprised at how much the meal had come to in contrast to other restaurants of this standard Despite the slighty expensive prices it was agreed that the night had been a success and we would returnThe New Bell is a finedining restaurant that sits above the Old Bell Inn in Causewayside From the look and feel of the lively pub beneath you wouldnt necessarily believe that a wonderful restaurant serving well thought out and exquisite Scottish cuisine lies above The restaurant is quite homely and almost quaint in its decor it puts me in mind of an old fashioned country house occupied by the sort of people who wear waxed Barbour jackets  and own a couple of Labradors Its classy yet understated and this sentiment is mirrored in the food which showcases the best of Scottish produce without being pretentious or fussy This is perhaps not the place to bring fashionable friends but it is the perfect venue for a meal with your parents or some rich relatives from out of townBeen to the New Bell once and thoroughly enjoyed it Great quality food and service reasonable prices and as an added bonus within a short walking distance from my home Would definitely recommendThe restaurant has recently moved their cuisine to Italian rather than the Scottish fare the older reviews refer to I believe it is less than a week since they changed the menu which is why Ive given them 4 rather than 3 ideally a 35 would be right at the moment There is definite potential in the food and the menu here I have to say the dishes that I had were very tasty and just required a certain something to lift them  to the next level The desserts however were really quite excellentThe atmosphere is quirky but lovely and relaxed I felt like Id been transported to a village restaurant sat above the local old mans pubThe staff are incredibly friendly and if I find myself in Newington in the future I believe I will go back to sample some more of Ivans the Italian head chef nosh :Went to the New Bell on Tuesday Fantastic service and even better food Love the contrast of pub downstairs with fine dining above Thoroughly recommend"

    "review":"Been eying this place for a while so ahead of an evening halloween ghost story lecture I popped by to check out the crepes you all  have been reviewing A friendly guy  behind the counter greeted me with a smile with playing playing south american music on his guitar this kinda made my day Options are juice coffee soft drinks and a daily list of crepes  I opted for a chicken and cheese crepe which by the sounds of it was what Nik B had It was pretty good for street food if I am honest and I recieved plenty of food for the 450 The chicken wasnt the tastiest of fillings but I  asked the kiosk fella to make it spicy so this won me over a bit moreIn short: good portionfor the price great service but was just lacking something to push this place to a 4 star for me Going to head back for the curry option at some point when I am in need of a quick mealGO THERE Gluten free deliciousness I was so impressed And they made it dairy free too by using an almond milk mixture and replacing cheese with pumpkin Fresh ingredients and really tasty crepe to hold it all together Do yourself a flavour I had chicken curry one partner had sausage We both loved it and will be going back tomorrowThe crepes are unbelievably delicious Specially because its served as soon as it is done The fillings are generous and delicious and the couple who owns the place are very sweet people Tastes like homemade food to me and its greatIf I could give this place more then 5 stars I absolutely would These are literally the most delicious crepes Ive ever had I always get the release the chicken and its amazing every time The husband and wife who own it are so sweet as well Every time I come back to Edinburgh this is my first stopWowaweewah What can I say This place absolutely does the best crepes in Edinburgh and Im lucky enough to work right by it As mentioned by others it does get busy during festival time also please avoid 1230130 during term time pesky kids and you should be prepared to wait around 10 minutes normally  however you cant rush perfection right Just go for a wander down to Sainos and itll be ready by the time you come back :As for the crepes themselves they are perfectly light yet really filling but without that omgIneedanap feeling you would get if they were made with bread I have tried the Release the Chicken crepe which was super tasty  however since then Ive been sold on the butternut squash veggie option think its called pumpkinsomething or other You can ask for it with or without cheese spice or no spice  I asked for mine with a little bit of spice and with mozzarella AND goats cheese I know I know madness But I had the Monday munchies ok Basically if youve ever wandered past and thought about trying it  do it Do it nowA great pitstop if you are looking for something quick to eatI had passed the kiosk tons of times whilst heading down middle meadow walk It does Brazilian crepes sweet and savoury and they are gluten free Its usually open all day at least during the week and prices range from about 35On the way to book group I was starving after a busy day at work and figured I should have something savoury before tea and cake My crepe was ready in a couple of minutes well wrapped up in a paper plate and paper towel which is perfect as there is nothing worse when the bottom literally falls out of a crepe and you end up covered in filling I opted for mozzarella sundried tomato and basil and it was lovely There was a decent amount of all the fillings and some salad too which made me feel vaguely healthy No spillage at all as it stayed well wrapped as I munched my way across Edinburgh UniIll definitely pop back here when I am in the area and looking for something to eat The girl who served me was lovely handing me a menu when I was trying to see what was posted up The kiosk is tiny but the space is well used  all fresh items are stored in the fridge and two hot plates means crepes can be made two at a time so I suspect if there was a queue you wouldnt wait long"

    "review":"Candy Bar is one of those place you instantly feel cooler when you enter Its one of these trendy swish bars that attempts to be uber cool and chic However I feel there is a bit of a contradiction going onCandy Bar advertises all their food as under a fiver So riddle me this how can you be so chic and fancy by serving food so cheap Its a ploy to attract people in off the usually expensive George Street and it works I was there for lunch and the place was packed with 20something woman having a gossip The menu consists of nachos sandwiches lite bites salads etc We had the nachos to share nothing special here quite a measly portion if you ask me We both went for Caesar Salad for our main course and it was below average Far too much mayo not really what I would call Caesar dressing and chewy croutons I havent had a chewy crouton before but it isnt very pleasant I tell you We both had tap water which came with cucumber in it The only place I have had that before is the Ritz in Paris so this must be the new trendy chic thing to do with waterOverall there is nothing outstanding about Candy Bar They do have a varied cocktail list but we didnt try Its basically a fancy looking bar with mediocre food And if your selling food for under a fiver what do you expectWith the exception of their christmas lunch menu last december Ive only ever drunk hereIts a great place to go for the kind of drinking occasion where a lot of nattering and catching up with friends is involved as its quieter and more chilled than a lot of other places at least during the day That said make sure your wallet is wellstocked before you go Yes its on George Street and yes its part of the Montpeliers chain and so a certain price range is always to be expected however Id say this place lacks some of the style and elegance of its sister venues like Tigerlily or Ricks and so I am slightly more reluctant to fork out the same amount for my vodka martiniSpeaking of which when I ordered my second it came not with an olive in it but a curl of lemon rind apparently there had only been one single olive on the premises and let me tell you that lemon rind does not make a tasty alternativeYou may be wondering why I gave it 3 stars when seemingly all ive done is complain Two reasons: first the staff are extremely friendly and welltrained and so ingredientspermitting serve up some goregous drinks I was instantly jealous of my friends Passionfruit Daiquiri Secondly as is the case in all the other Montpeliers places at the moment selected drinks are half price such as glasses of house wineIts still worth a visit especially if nearby Tigerlily is too fullI love going here at Christmas time   not because they do an especially good job at decorating the place but there always seems to be a Christmasjumper party when Im there Its the sort of place you would go on your staff night out  its really nice I was put off at first as it doesnt look like much from the outside you have to go down some stairs and under a canopy to get in but I was very impressed with the interior Its your typical Edinburgh trendy barrestaurant cool wallpaper and nice furniture  As a result all the people are ridiculously cool and the place is heaving with MILFs and DILFs It is the sort of place to take your mum out for a liquid lunch and spend the afternoon peoplewatchingIf youre looking for some after work drinks and some reasonably priced food to fill a gap then the Candy Bar should tick all your boxes Although not exactly gourmet dining the food here is pretty tasty and everything on the menu is under 5 I was very tempted to try one of their fondues which you can get to share between two people at 350 per person They have a cheese fondue and even though I love cheese I just cant bring myself to eat it in fondue form My old flatmates used to eat it all the time and the whole flat smelled like old feet for days afterwards The chocolate one was much more appealing to me and you got banana marshmallows strawberries and mini cookies for dipping yumAs far as drinks go they have a well stocked bar with a good selection of premium spirits they also have a range of chocolate shooters and if it hadnt been 6 oclock when I ventured in I would have probably gone for one They have a reasonable cocktail menu with all the classics plus a few extras I opted for a White Lady and it was refreshingly tangy the cocktails start from 695 and upwards which I think is a little bit pricey given that its quite a standard barWe popped in on a Wednesday which is pub quiz night we missed the start of the pub quiz but after hearing some of the questions youd have to be pretty thick to not get full marks Im useless at pub quizzes but the questions here were ridiculous a few that spring to mind are Where is Cologne and How often is the World Cup held Now I have no clue about football but even I know the answer to that and the questions didnt get much harderDespite the awful pub quiz its a nice place to sit and have a chat it was quite stuffy inside so we sat outside on rather comfy little leather booths with a candle on each table which I thought was a nice touch Im torn whether or not to award three or four stars I enjoyed my evening here but Im not particularly in a rush to go back so Ill stick with three just now it seemed to be missing something that I cant quite put my finger onGone are the days when this place was the nonWetherspoons option for cheaper drinks on George Street Deals seem to be a thing of the past and the pints are all over 4 Peroni coming in at over 5 Our barman last night was a cheery chap but that alones not really an enticement to be back anytime soonWe ventured here on a Monday night the place looks really cool : mirrors and shiny metals i liked it the music was new and not just chart nonsense so i was in my element Once seated we were given menus and left to browse it and their epic cocktail list Not to sound like an alcoholic but i LOVED their cocktail list theyve something for everyone classics twists on classics and new creations The food menu was good and catered for everyone they had some really good offers on with their sidesstarters 3 for 6 and main courses were reduced to 5 MondayThursday so prices and selection are REALLY good We ordered drinks and food then sat back to enjoy our night Now im a pretty laid back guy if im out for dinner the last thing i want to do is be rushed so i dont mind a reasonable wait This however was not reasonable our drinks 2 pints a spiritmix and ONE cocktail took some time getting to us the food also took some time getting to us and our second round of cocktails took a ridiculously long timeOnce everything arrived we couldnt find fault it was tasty and filling The staff were lovely and went through all the right motions when serving us but the speed of service was just too slow So to recap great venue EPIC cocktail selection really good food menu just be prepared to wait a while"

    "review":"The newly opened sister restaurant to Hanams Pomegranate offers middle eastern cuisine in smart fresh surroundings Its open until 3am at the weekend so I could see it developing a cult following as a late night dining spotOverall we said: Pomegranate is a new restaurant with all thrills and spills inherent in a new venture Even though the guys running the show are experienced restaurateurs they are not immune from the vicissitudes of fate and fortune It certainly fills a new niche in terms of a late place in this neighbourhood offering a different option from the more established fare so Im confident the business will thrive Im also sure that it will find me a regular visitor when then mood takes me But I sincerely hope that the beddingin process ups the quality and consistency of both the dishes and the serviceNot as good as its sister restaurant The menu is quite different as they serve in smaller dishes more meze style The service is also not as good as Hanams Would not return to Pomegranate as Hanams is not too far away and definitely MORE WORTH ITLoved it Food was plenty and excellent We had 3 mezzes each and shared and it was loads Very reasonable price and loved that we could BYOB Service was excellent especially loved Mama Spelling SorryGreat food always manage to fit you in BYOB no corkage a bonus The babaganoush is delicious We actually drive from Glasgow to eat here some nights Had a wonderful dinner here it is a sister restaurant of Hanam but there was no lowering of good quality food between the two restaurantsWe had a variety of starters all wonderfully fresh  flavoursome and we had different mains: lamb chops lamb kebab and lamb wrap  all were perfectly seasoned and well cooked All in all deliciousness on a plate and well be back next time visiting EdinburghStaff were attentive and well presented and for those of you that want an alcoholic drink with your food bring it with you : as they only serve non alcoholic drinksReally nice place good food friendly service The chicken wings are fabulous and I loved the fattoush"

    "review":"Came here on a Saturday night at short notice but managed to get a table  Was really impressed with the look of the place  not too cheesy or gaudy its a really nice and big place  The service was attentive and friendly and the food was delicious You could tell it was all cooked fresh and the presentation was good  We had assorted dim sum chicken and sweetcorn soup and chicken spring rolls to start all of which were lovely  We then had combination chow mien chicken chow mien and crispy shredded chicken which again were plentiful and really tasty  At the end of our meal the lovely owner Katharine came over for a chat and offered us all a free drink which I thought was lovely and a real personal touch  She obviously really cares about the business and we all chatted for ages Will definitely be going back and will also switch our takeaways to here tooThe salt and pepper shrimp was tasty but I prefer it chrunchier crab and sweet corn soup was great and the szechuan chicken was just right  Service was friendly but slow even when there were not a lot of people at the restaurant  I prefer Manor over Chop Chop and Golden DragonThe Chinese Manor House is the best Chinese food I have had in Edinburgh rich flavours and no generic sweet sauces good quality meat and seafood and generally just really tasty dishes From that opening one would assume an instant five stars and if reviews were just based on the food that would be the caseThe thing is while the food is great the restaurant is simply too far out of town most of the time and some of the joys of the food a lot of dishes are served still sizzling is lost in a takeaway Location lets the Chinese Manor House down for most of us though if you are local to the area I would strongly recommend it For me though it is a worthwhile but occasional treatThis is a pretty good Chinese sit down restaurant in Edinburgh and its close to my hotel where Im staying  There is a wide variety of selections for the meal  Here are the following items that I had with my meal:Crab and sweet corn soup: Delicious and great to eat with the chilly weather  The corn was definitely sweet corn and you can find chunks of crab meat in the soupChicken spring rolls fried  I wish they offered soft and not fried spring rolls but this is Chinese not Vietnamese  Its served with a sweet chili sauce  I think its just a piece of chicken wrapped with the eggroll soft wrap and fried  It was good nothing specialFor entree I tried the sliced beef tenderloin with pepper sauce sizzling plate the chicken with ginger and onions sizzling plate and the sweet and sour king prawns   a the beef tenderloin is served on a sizzling plate with onions  It was very good with a tasty semithick brown pepper sauce  However next time i think Ill just order the beef plate because the beef tenderloin is significantly more expensive for the same style entree I think    b The chicken was great as well  Once again served in a sizzling plate with a brown sauce  The ginger was pretty strong though so made sure not to accidentally eat a piece of ginger  c Im not a fan of sweet and sour dishes but I thought the sweet and sour prawns dish here was the absolute best dish of the night  Cant really describe it but it was great  Im still getting used to the fact that theres no free drink refills here and also that rice is not served with the entree you have to order it in addition to your meal  But guess thats just how it works here  This place is pretty pricey in my opinion but that is based on the prices that Im used to in the US  Compared to other restaurants in the UK I think that this is comparable in costs to other restaurants"

    "review":"I came here quite a lot when I lived in Marchmont normally on a Friday or Saturday for a treat after eating healthily for the rest of the week It is always busy as like minded Marchmont based students come here looking for a quick cheap and cheerful bite to eat or a quick meal to line their stomachs for a well deserved night outThey serve general fish and chip shop food and I usually went for smoked sausage and chips the chips however were quite often greasy the smoked sausage was however always pretty good Marchmont takeaway also does offer a range of pies fish and cold drinksThey do offer a pretty good pizza deal where they offer a 10 inch pizza with two topping for 360 but once again it is pretty greasyConsidering Edinburgh is by the sea and is supposed to have great fish it seems to be bereft of a decent chippy Every one Ive been to has been a disappointment and Marchmont Take Away is no different I mean the chips are Ok To be fair though when a chippy cant do chips youve really got to start asking some question Its just the fish Its never ever good The batter is soggy too thick and the fish is always tasteless The other stuff they do is no great shakes either sorry Scotland Ive never understood deep fried pizzaFor chips its Ok for anything else I wouldnt bother Come on Edinburgh you can do better than this cant youIts hard to go wrong with chips and in my opinion one chip tastes much like another  Yet people tend to form irrational attachments to certain chippies and will swear them superior to all others  Last time I was in Marchmont Takeaway for example the girl in front of me in the queue was telling the proprietor that he sold the best chips in the world and she would never buy hers anywhere else  When I eventually tasted my chips however there was nothing exceptional about them at allTherefore I can only conclude that chip shop loyalty is a matter of sentimentality rather than taste and in that case I can see why Marchmont Takeaway might come across as endearing  For one thing its very very small and for another its run by an old Italian man with an amazingly wizened face who can be seen at all hours of the day peering hopefully through the window for customers and who calls everyone darling in a slightly menacing tone of voice  For some people I can see such eccentricity is very intriguingAt the end of the day though a chip is just a chip and the ones that Marchmont Takeaway sells are no better or worse than anywhere elseThis takeway is quite small and though it markets itself if it bothers at all to be honest as a fish and chips place I noticed an extensive pizza menu on its wallsIts highly improbable that you will have the best pizza of your life at one of these places but the prices are so good and the customers sometimes so inebriated it all equals out in the end As a side note I will agree with some of the other reveiwers about the lack of fantastic fish and chips in Edinburgh youd expect some of these less glamorous places to serve decent fish but the best Ive had was at the Doctors pub just off Bristo SquareBack to this marchmont takeaway its worth a shot for a decent meal and some banter with the ownerI feel extra compelled to write this review since it only has a 3 star average and most of the reviews are quite old The owner Donna took over this spot 4 years ago She is an incredible person She is so committed to local environmentally sustainable ingredients Like another reviewer said she places a LOT of importance on the food being freshly fried She also replaces her oil once a week which is costly but she prefers to have a better product When I asked her how often other shops replace their oil she just laughed and said Never she told me she has worked in the industry for about 30 years at this pointThis was my first visit to a Edinburgh takeaway as I just moved here and loved how friendly Donna was along with the other younger employee She took time frying me up a delicious piece of haddock with chips and sauce Since she replaces the oil so frequently I found the fish to not be as greasy as other places Id had it The haddock supper was 560 Next time I am going to try the mushy peas which are apparently delicious also if you call ahead she will have it ready for when you stop byThis place hasnt had a review in a few years so I thought Id update it a bit A nice  fish and chip shop with the emphasis on the fish being freshly fried Whilst this means the food is tastier and less stodgy than the usual fish supper it also results in not a lot of space in the small premises whilst the meals are cookedThe fare on offer is pretty standard  fish sausages pizza burgers and chips We had a choice of fish  haddock or rock cod I opted for the special breadcrumbed haddock supper which was really good The chips are also recommendedStaff are friendly and efficient All things considered this is probably the best takeaway option in Marchmont"

    "review":"As with other branches of the chain Ive patronised this does what it says on the tin  large portions for a decent price along with a fairly sensibly priced bar The service was very good tooWhere it seems to be missing a trick though given its location  the views to Fife is not having a beer garden Given its location there could be concerns about the clientele it might attract with that but it still seems worth a tryLucky my friend had a car and decided to eat here before our Cramond Beach walk  This is my first time in a Toby Carvery ever  The location near the beach and the fact that it is a huge family gathering style eatery makes it perfect for a family gathering and a nice walk at the beach to let the children run wild and burn some fat  I have the barbecue chicken wings to start off  Smothered in barbecue sauce the wings were average and accompanied by a yogurt style dip  We then proceeded to get the main roasts  There was a queue but soon it was our turn  I was a bit disappointed with the portion of the meat  You get 4 to choose from  gammon pork beef  turkey  You can either choose all 4 or choose a selection  I chose everything except turkey  The pork was dry but the other 2 were just OK  Funnily enough I wasnt given extra of another since I opted out of the turkey  My friend chose 2 so she got 2 miserable thin slices only  You can take as much of the other extra as you want  They consist of yorkshire pudding pork crackling stuffing brocolli and cheese mash potatoes peas parsnips carrots and a few more others  They looked like they have been mass prepared so lack of quality  Gravy station consists of beef vegetarian option and another  Horseradish sauce was the best amongst the saucesWaitresses were very friendly and helpful though  Everyone working there were always smiling and no attitude  Unfortunately food is just average and just enough to make my stomach happy  Nothing special to be honest  Off to the beach to burn some fatIf rock hard burned yet miraculously Undercooked potatoes end cuts of a roast and ice cold veg is your thing then by all means waste your money and time sitting waiting 15 mins for your drink and standing in queues for 20 mins when theres no servers at the hotplate Honestly itd take less effort and money to cook your own meal and you have more chance of it being hot too"

    "review":"We went to this cafe because it was the only place we could find on the Royal Mile with free outside seats Unfortunately we would have been better off continuing our search elsewhere The service was acceptable but the Caledonian Best was bad and explained away by the landlord as being the last pint in the barrel The prices were shocking even for a tourist trapGreat company good food lovely whisky Truly a comfy place to escape the weather and sample some scotch Dont know anything about whisky No worries The owner sat down and explained the finer subtleties of the drink to usI found this cafepub after wandering past the many kilt and celtic jewelry shops on the Royal Mile relatively early one Saturday morning  I was on a mission to try Scotlands legendary and rather intimidating haggis and since Rabbie Burns featured a Scottish breakfast complete with haggis AND fried egg I was immediately sold  Wandering into the quaint primarily wooden interior I was greeted with smiles and urged to sit wherever I liked  I chose a seat by the window to maximize people watchingOrdering was extremely efficient and easy as I already knew I wanted to try the Scottish breakfast 7  A mug of tea 1 was presented by the cheerful waitress and the breakfast platter quickly followed  I had 3 rashers of bacon extra crispy like I asked 1 sausage 1 portion of haggis 1 fried egg 1 tomato a small lake of baked beans and 1 flap jack  Firstly the haggis did not look anything like I pictured  I was expecting an alarmingly intact stomach full of ground organs  Instead the pile of haggis looked rather like smashed falafel balls  In fact it tasted rather like a palatable hybrid of sausage and falafel  Im not sure if it was the real deal but I liked it  It was especially good with runny egg yolk and flap jack  Everything was delicious and I made quick word of the platter  PARTING THOUGHT: Are there really enough tourists to support all the kilt shops on the Royal MileIll begin with the positives Their Longbow cider a nothugely potent potation I have a habit of falling on when faced with the inevitable conundrum of beverage selection ie bar themed https:enwikipediaorgwikiTheParadoxofChoice tastes very much like Longbow cider Thats about as much as I can say seeing as thats literally all I drank  al fresco and for what amounted to only 15 minutes probably The negatives arent as mundane There exists in the window of THE RABBIE BURNS a very lifelike Madame Tussaudsesque figure of I deduced Sherlock style Rabbie Burns From a distance I thought to myself YES Finally I love lifelike wax people And I havent been to a Madame Tussauds in weeks It was my lucky break or so I thought On a closer inspection of the figure close enough to assess its finer details I was disappointed in both the craftsmanship and form It lacked the so essential spirit I had become accustomed to detecting at the renown and cherished Madame Tussauds This joint may be something of a tease to the gowax campThe Rabbie Burns is a very reputable cafe on the Royal Mile serving up a number of snacks ranging from paninis and breakfasts to burgersThe decor inside and out should give you a clue that its one for the tourists but thats not to say the locals wouldnt enjoy a munch from here Although its on the expensive side of pricey for teas sandwiches and paninis over a fiver it seems to be commonplace to charge that amount on the Royal Mile and the food is goodWhere the Rabbie Burns earns its stars from me is through its choice and presentation Its a clean cafe with loads of seats including a huge space outdoors during the summer There are loads of options on the menu and even though some smaller snacks are more expensive there are full breakfasts and lunches you can devour as an alternative They had some eats I didnt expect to see such as Greek meatballs and although I didnt see all that much in the way of veggie options no veggie burgers Im afraid there were fillings in other dishes suitable for vegetariansI was even more impressed to see they serve up some bottled beers and wines Its refreshing to see a cafe have some alcohol on their menu since many of the pubs on the Royal Mile are traditional and thus quite cosy and enclosed On a summers day the Rabbie Burns can seem like the airy option and getting to sit outside a cafe watching the world go by while drinking a few beers is quite continental I would opt for the beer or an Irish coffee over spending 250 on a pot of tea  to be honest that was the one area that I found a little offputtingIts quite expensive the exterior is a bit tacky and its clearly geared towards tourists but the choice on the menu and tasty food make it one of the better placs to grab lunch on the Royal MileDefinitely a place to avoid Came in for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning and encountered some of the worst service Ive experienced in Edinburgh Ordered the eggs and salmon and simply asked them to cook the eggs differently poached vs scrambled The waiter flat out REFUSED saying that if I didnt want scrambled eggs I needed to order something else I even offered to pay extra but he said they could make zero accommodations to the menu The restaurant was empty so it definitely wasnt a timecapacity issue either  just rude staff who didnt want to be bothered I could see if it was a complex request but this was a TINY ask They even had poached eggs available elsewhere on the menu  they just wouldnt let me pair them with the salmon The street is full of other places where the staff is kind welcoming and accommodating  this one is best to skip"

    "review":"Went into town christmas shopping and decided to pop down hanover street to see if we could find any good deals for lunch La lanterna had a 3 course lunch meal for a very good priceWe had doughballs for a started and pizza and pasta for our mains We halved each to try both options The pepperoni on the pizza was underneath the cheese so it was cooked but not burnt never thought of cooking it this way before but it made a big differenceThe staff were very attentive and it was a lovely little quiet restaurant Would thoroughly recommend if youre in town looking for a good meal Only reason they have gotten 4 stars is because they only had tiramasu or coffee for the dessert option and I dont like coffee so I was a bit stuckApart from the manager lady who seemed like a massive control freak the food was really good I had the prawn cocktail and gnocchi both were delicious I just happened to be sitting in the worst part of the restaurant right at the back where I could hear all the conversation between staffThis is a cute small wonderful little Italian restaurant The food is great and the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in Italy The prices are decent and it is well worth tryingWalking around Edinburgh on a sunny afternoon so rare to find a nice place to have lunch outside we stumbled upon two tables at La Lanterna RistoranteWe couldnt really believe our eyes but they do a 3 course lunch meal for 5 How That cant be good surely But it was very tastyThe choice of food was limited for this deal of course but we could still have plenty of the mains just no seafood I had the doughballs for a starter which were very nice And then I had the salmon pasta which was delicious My partners potato skins and lasagne were also very good Desert was amaretto cheesecake and just delicious We left the place with a small bill and a very happy tummy It would have been a four star review if it werent for this faux pas thoughWe were served by a friendly guy yes it was a bit slow but we werent too bothered The place was full inside it was a saturday afternoon what can you expect This couldnt be said by our neighbour who complained about the slow service to another waiter He only sat down a few minutes after us and his food arrived a bit after ours  I dont think he had much to complain about but hey opinions differ But here is the faux pas that waiter replied to this complaint with Ah yes he is very slow he doesnt understand anything hes an idiot Ill get it sorted  Said idiot colleague came back 2 minutes later with the foodThere is no excuse for this you dont slag off a colleague even if he or she is making lots of mistakes or is being an idiot Apologise for it and get it sorted but dont slag off Ok rant overAnyway there you go a three star review All because I didnt feel like it was that nice a place to work for the staff The food is great the deal is amazing but you do feel like the staff just isnt having a good time working hereWe absolutely loved this restaurant  It was in a city book and the price seemed right so we thought we would give it a go  We are so glad that we did  Its below street level and what we could tell had about 40 seats  We started out with garlic cheese bread which was delicious  I had the lasagna and my daughter had the spaghetti bolognese  My lasagna was fantastic  It was cooked right in the little bowl and was the perfect size  My daughters dish was just as good  We both were sighing as we ate  We then had dessert  My daughter had tiramisu which she said was fantastic  I had Pavlova which melted in my mouth and was one of the best desserts I have ever hadNow let me talk about the owners  Our waitress talked with us when we were done eating and she is the daughter of Tina the owner  Tina and her family came over from Italy to Edinburgh and her grandpa owned a restaurant on the street  Tina worked in the restaurant for years  Not because she wanted to but because it was a requirement  She then opened the current restaurant with her husband  Tina is there all the time from before they open until they close at night  She has over 42 years in the industry  The place is very small but super clean  The food was made with all fresh ingredients and you could tell they care about the business  If I lived in Edinburgh this would be a regular place for me  Seemed like a regular location for the locals as there was a group of women in the window seat drinking over lunch and when they left Tina came over and gave them all hugs  If you are in Edinburgh look this place up for a fresh Italian meal at a great priceReally great place Lovely homely feel with honest simple meals I had the mussels in a garlic and tomato broth oh that broth nom nom nom and the spag carbonara for mainI still like La Piazza http:wwwyelpcoukbizlapiazzaedinburgh for pasta in Edinburgh however La Lanternas past was good  but in a different way It reminds me more of what youd have at your Italian neighbours house  simple hearty filling  Like a big warm hug tm"

    "review":"Come here often for a toastiepanini friendly staff and quick service Best of all the food is unbelievable They also let you pick and chose to essentially make your own toastieSpotting the quirky Zebra print exterior and Red Espresso label printed on the window I popped into the Zulu lounge hoping that the cafe would distinguish itself from the many other cafes snack bars in Edinburgh Indeed the Zulu lounge is unique The Red Espresso brand is a style of rooibos tea with a particularly zingy punch nice and all but not something I make a habit of drinking  The avocado pear and biltong dried beef roll I sampled simply confused my tastebuds and left me unsure as to whether I liked such South African flavours As a lunch meal it was cheap enough around 4 however I cant help but categorise the Zulu Lounge as a hit or miss affair see what you thinkWalking up Morningside Road The Zulu Lounge shouldnt fail to catch your eye  The zebra print on the shop front South African flag above the door and interesting name make for an intriguing appearance  Inside the place is definitely more interesting than your avergae cafe with a whole range of ingredients which you can almost guarantee you wont have seen before  It prides itself in serving red espresso which is meant to be a strong aromatic and pungent coffee  I had a Gatsby which was a massive foot long bread roll filled with a really sweet cured ham with avocado and a this sauce which tasted like a cross between yoghurt and mayonnaise  This was served with crisps for about 450 which was an okay deal considering it was quite a lot of food  The roll tasted unusual but it was new interesting and filling  The Zulu Lounge is a great alternative to the usual greasy spoons and certainly worth a visit for a culinary trip on the wild sideI wish I lived much closer to the Zulu Lounge as it is truly amazing serving traditional South African dishes with exotic flavours Although it is quite small it would be difficult to miss the zebra print shop in Morningside with a big South African flag The Zulu Lounge offers an extensive breakfast menu and the main meals are authentic South African dishes such as Gatzby a filled baguette and traditional South African sausage I had the smoked salmon burrito which was really delicious and just under 7 so it was quite expensive I think the burrito was a safe dish to order so next time I would like to be more adventurous and try their traditional sausage as one of the servers in the shop described the sausage as having a unique flavour They also serve home baking hot chocolate and best of all fresh muffins which are gorgeousMy friend suggested this place and although I dont live too far away from it I had never heard of it I didnt try any food so I cant comment on that but we did have hot chocolates which were amazing My friend got the spicey hot chocolate and I had the bueno nutella hot chocolate which looked pretty epic and tasted amazing Ill have to go back to check out what else they have on offer as the menu looked like it had some interesting things on itI just realised I never reviewed The Zulu Lounge I have been getting lunch and amazing coffee here for over 1 5 years now They have amazing salads and soup with proper nice bread and the best coffee in morningside possibly the best in Edinburgh  The place is tiny but the take away prices are great Around lunchtime you have to be prepared to wait a few minutes as it is very popular If you want a nice and healthy lunch they have unhealthier alternatives as well this is the place to go They also have amazing looking cupcakes and other sweet stuff which I have been just barely strong enough to resist so far"

    "review":"Dragon Way seems surprisingly little known given its location and long establishment It shouldnt be Perhaps this is because it is overshadowed by the ever popular music venue Henrys Cellar Bar below itIve been to Rainbow Arch several times now and each time it seems to get better and better Its a dim sum specialist so while there try some dim sum Youll find some more creative and unusual varities The alternative menu is decent tooThe general aesthetic of place isnt incredible but not terrible either It had a sort of oldschool Chinese restaurant feel Sometimes the tablecloth and menus dont seem that new eitherIve heard that the staff are not always the most friendly but every time Ive been in Ive always found them to be helpful and perfectly amiableAlso keep in mind that Raindbow Arch closes late around 3am making it one of the few decent late night restaraunts in EdinburghA really great dim sum restaurant in the heart of EdinburghI know this is ridiculous but this is seriously one of the best dimsum restaurants Ive ever been toand Ive lived in Hong Kong  The deepfried custard buns are out of this world and Ive never actually found them at any other dimsum restaurant and other dimsum staples like the peanut dumplings shrimp crepes and chicken feet are all quite good too  The wait staff can be supernice or supergrumpy depends on the person the day etc but the food is always greatA few tips: For dimsum go at night  Counterintuitive I know but I think their dimsum chef comes at night because the dimsum esp aforementioned custard buns are seems much fresher at night If youre getting a soup I recommend bringing your own containersthey dont have great containers for taking soup homeDefinitely recommendedOk so maybe dim sum is the way to go on this place The nice thing is that they have it all the time and this place is open late though they closed at 11 when I was there despite teh giant OPEN TILL 3 AM sign So maybe call firstIt was fine We had duck and char sieu on rice and hot and sour soup Though the soup had nice flavour it was SO cornstarchy and gelatenous that you could probably walk on the surface Or call it hot n sour custard But maybe that was just that batchHmm I didnt see what other reviewers saw but oh well"

    "review":"Good place to go after your shopping in princess streetHas a good selection of food on the menu to chose fromIts not to pricey eitherThe staff were politeStandard McDonalds mit sehr vielen Sitzpltzen und BahnhofshallenFlairIm definitly lovin it If I just happen to be in the area which I am mostly good for something quick and efficientAh McDonalds you old dog which is probably what you put in your burgers we had some good times eh To think I actually used to get excited about a McDonalds all those years agoThis is actually a branch of McDonalds I used to still visit a few years ago when my family visited Edinburgh Other than the decor not much has changedThis is possibly Edinburghs premier McDonalds Situated on Princes St it boasts two large floors Apart from water saving toilets ironic for a company known for its destructive environment policy and free wifi there isnt anything special about this McDonalds Its dressed in that new McDonalds style with natural organic colours combined with tidy leather to give an impression of both health and sophistication the latter a la Starbucks This hip new feel seems to be the result of the heavy criticism the corporation received at the beginning of the 2000s on health and ethical grounds and its increasing reputation by the middle classes as somewhere they wouldnt want to be seen dead in which was unfortunately one of the potential side effects of eating there too much All this culminated in the well known documentary Super Size Me which documents a McDonalds lifestyles drastic effects on the film makers physical and psychological wellbeing and discovers the companys corporate influence including its encouragement of poor nutrition for its own profitLike all McDonalds come to the Princes St branch knowing what youre going to get If you want cheap convenient slop flavoured with salt and sugar to hook your primeval taste buds then so be it But dont expect a nutritional meal or fine cuisine After all this is the place where a Cesar salad contains more fat than a burgerI looked into this branch because Ill admit I was curious But I really have no desire to eat here I last ate a McDonalds when I was stuck overnight in a German train station and there was literally nothing else to eat But with knowledge of McDonalds track record of opposing unions their contribution to the industry which causes more carbon emissions than the entire transport industry as the worlds largest user of intensively farmed beef and their repeated threat of legal action against critics means I am a more than just put off by their soggy chipsI also find it unfortunate that our capital citys main shopping street is now totally overpopulated by chain stores with an ever dwindling number of local traditional and independent shops that can not possibly compete"

    "review":"This Chinese takeaway in Newington has nice friendly service and is in a great location but some of the food isnt quite up to the standard which you would expect for the prices you pay  The menu has a good range of authentic Chinese dishes and the place has a pretty good atmosphere inside  I went for the vegetable spring rolls followed by the crispy Hoisin duck  It took a fair while to arrive but there were enough tabloid newspapers to keep us amused as we waitedThe springrolls were tasty inside yet the pastry was a bit greasy and almost wet  The Hoisin sauce for the duck was delicious but the duck itself was beyond crispy and verging on tough  Although the meal wasnt disastrous Ive had better takeaways in EdinburghI have Gibsons back on this one the spring rolls are rank Like moldy frozen veg  buried alive in a papery pastry Just tasted like soggy cardboard My Special Fried Rice was pretty good thoughNot the best but itll doThis is not a particularly good Chinese takeaway It is greasy not massively cheap and for some reason it takes ages for even the simplest dish As the other guys have already said the spring rolls are terrible but surprisingly the duck spring rolls arent actually that bad I have no idea how there is such a difference but Chinese takeaways are often a mystery to me The noodles are average and for an extra 10p you can have them in sweet chilli sauce which is actually quite niceOverall the food is pretty average and what you would expect from a takeaway but the thing that ruined it for me was the service The young guy there is ok but the older woman is really rude and comes across as being really patronising This was compounded by the fact that when I got home I realised she had written down my order wrong and I had a mix of what I wanted and another rogue dish Grumble grumbleAnother standard Chinese takeaway I feel bad for places like Summerhall Kitchen sometimes they are small independent trying to compete with the many many other takeaways But at the same time the greasy poor quality probably not remotely Chinese food always gets to me Summerhall Kitchen offers the usual array of takeaway standards There is a big menu but that usually means the ingredients arent fresh another staple of a cheap takeaway They do offer some money saving offers like the student deal for two at 1350 and they also offer a 10 student discountOverall this place isnt that expensive but at 46 for a dish you could still go elsewhere for far better qualityNice Chinese takeaway just opposite the meadows in Summerhall Summerhall Kitchen has some of the best value of the Chinese takeaways in the area with a main course with rice coming in well below 6 The choice is extensive and they work with both Just Eat and Hungry House so ordering online is simpleWe were a group of 5 hanging out in a friends flat when we decided to order from Summerhall Kitchen at the recommendation of one of the group We ordered on Just Eat and were given an estimated delivery time around 45 minutes later if I remember correctly When the food arrived earlier than predicted it was all hot fresh and tasted great The portion sizes are definitely large enough to make a good meal and some of the less ravenous members of the group even managed to have some lunch for the next dayAll in all it was a good experience and I will definitely be trying Summerhall Kitchen again in the future RecommendedBeef with TomatoBeef with MushroomBeef with PineappleBeef in Black Bean SauceChicken with TomatoChicken with MushroomChicken with PineappleChicken in Black Bean SaucePork with TomatoPork with MushroomPork with PineapplePork in Black Bean SauceBeef Fried RiceChicken Fried RicePork Fried RiceAll followed by chronic diarrhea We all know what to expect from this takeaway just by looking at it so theres not much point in moaning"

    "review":"I was short on time in Edinburgh and wanted to dine at one of the few Michelinstarred places  I am so glad that I picked Castle Terrace  The atmosphere and service were spot on and not a bit stuffy I loved the decor which was sleek and sexy but still warm and comfortingMy martini apertif was wellmade and dry as requested  The amuse bouche that came with it were the perfect accompaniment to the heavy reading I was about to do There are several menus to choose from including the multicourse tasting menu a vegetarian tasting menu as well as regular and vegetarian a la carte versions  Since you are allowed to mix and match I ordered my courses from bothEverything I sampled was delicious and prepared with the kind of care and technique one would expect  The wine list was well chosen with an interesting selection of half bottles which I always appreciate  My meal was one of the highlights of my time in Scotland and an experience I wont soon forgetWe visited in April 2015 Ambience is average Service is excellent The deconstructed Caesar salad was interesting and delicious We had the salmon and roe deer to start which were good but not amazing The salmon was presented well The roe deer was a bit bland The mains were good but nothing remarkable The star of the meal was the chocolate souffle served with popcorn ice cream which was heaven Overall a mediocre meal but excellent dessertFood too good not to give anything less than 4 stars However my wife and I made the mistake of booking onlyavailable slot of 9PM and felt a bit rushed to order while we were having cocktails in the bar area  before being seated Service and atmosphere a bit stuffy  maybe to be expected but not especially comfortable vs NYC and SF venues of similar caliber Again each plate was near perfect but mild tension in air prevents 5th starSimply exceptional food and amazing service We came here for lunch in February and had to come back for dinner The wait staff are very knowledgeable on both the food and wine As youd expect from a chefs hat restaurant the presentation and taste of the food us incredible Highly recommendedCastle Terrace a restaurant I actually walked by two years earlier on a previous trip sits only a few hundred feet from the castle signature of Edinburgh  This was a proper romantic evening  Oh sure the girlfriend and I had enjoyed dinners before but not like this all dressed up the tens way better than nines  We took our seats in a secluded area able to be detached via curtains to the rest of the restaurantwhich offered the illusion we were either special or pariahs not meant for the eyes to Edinburghs elite  I had already made the declaration that we would be tackling the tasting menu an option I wished more restaurants would offer despite the intimidating price  Flipping to the end of this tale the meal cost me nearly 300 cdn for two which included two glasses of wine and the additional extravagance of adding shaved truffles to my risottobecause apparently I liked the idea of eating something worth its weight in palladiumSo let me get all snobbish pretentious and a little patronizing Castle Terrace didnt start the meal with an amuse bouche rather we each received a small plate of canaps a caper and cumin burger a salt cod barbajuan and a Caesar saladall miniature bitesized  The latter was the most impressive literally exploding in your mouth  The bread which followed was served in its own toquelike bowl  Yup the bread came with its own adorable little hat  The appetizer was a bizarre take on baked potato with cheese served in a ramekin  This was shortly followed by the tartare of Loch Duart salmon served sushistyle with wasabi ice cream  This was a favorite of both of oursa true avant garde art piece  The wasabi ice cream was a particular surprise  The fourth dish was seared handdived Orkney scallops served with a light curry Castle Terrace style  Castle Terrace seems to revel in naming the origin of its ingredients an attribute often seen in many highend restaurants  Personally I dont require it they only exist to make the titles longer  I dont know the importance of an Orkney scallop picked by hand over one pulled off the coast of Vancouver  Is Orkney really that much better  Then came the risotto made with organic spelt from Doves FarmREALLY  Is it that important where the grain came from  While my girlfriends risotto was topped by ox tongue and chirozo mine was layered in waferthin truffle shavings  It might have been more expensive but mine wasnt as good as the one opposite of me proof that price does not reflect value  At this point you would think we were done but not we still had three more courses to go  The fish dish was my personal favoriteroasted fillet of North Sea sigh hake served with an Asian style broth poured at the plate  The pork dish after was an immensely attractive fillet of Ayrshjust pork it was porkserved with braised fennel smoked aubergine puree and basil gnocchi  Finally the dessert was a bavarois of conference pears served with a yogurt sorbet and rosemary caramelThere were many details about the dishes Im leaving out like the way the pork sat in a sauce kept in place by the puree or that the broth for the hake was poured over it sending its toppings cascading down the sides to form the ingredients of a soup  Or how about that each dish had its own arrangement of cutlery the fish dish was served with a large blunt knife and a trident  Castle Terrace mixes the molecular gastronomic talents seen with Teatro but doesnt go as far in the realms of the bizarre making each dish slightly more accessible  The flavors were divine marking Castle Terrace as a real jewel in the city  Would I recommend it  It depends if you have such money to set aside that you dont require for procuring shelter  You have to really want such an evening which we did  With that out of the way Im not saying that you need to spend that kind of money to have a great experience in Edinburgh  My review for Witchery was glowing and they cost barely half as much the same goes for Shezan which cost half THAN THAT  Upon an inevitable return to Edinburgh I cant see going to Castle Terrace again given so many options which would certainly cost a lot less  But once in a life I think everyone needs to take in a place like Teatro Claridges or Castle Terrace  Pick whichever one is closer and go  And take the girlfriend or wife not the kids or your poker buddy  I would also permit sister or mother because wellguilty as charged  Is my review of Castle Terrace bias because it was a date  Yup  DECOR:  9PLATING: 10SERVICE:  95FOOD:  10VALUE:  7OVERALL:  91 out of 10Castle Terrace was good Actually it was probably great Once checked in we were told that our table was ready and we could sit straight down to eat We went to the barlounge and had some canaps and a cocktail The canaps rocked They had a little gooey caesar salad which I was little to rough with and it  burst open all over my shirt not a great start to my night There was also a beetroot and goats cheese biscuit Which was a phenomenal accompaniment to my cocktailAfter being seated what happened next was amazingThe Amuse Bouche was an Arbroath Smokie Panna Cotta that was disguised as a boiled egg It was followed by a salmon dish Served sushi style w Wasabi ice cream Not one to be missed Then we had the scallop curry Served with a little nan bread and potato puree The final big bang was a beautiful pea soup with ham rock ravioli So about 80 minutes in we had 4 beautiful courses that were filled with imagination Then the what followed was just depressing I was on such a high saying how much better Castle Terrace was compared to The Kitchin Even potentially better than my new favourite place The Table The following dish was Hake which cooked perfectly but just a little boring It didnt have the wow factor of the dishes that came before it Then the meat dish  a risotto of spelt with beef  apparently a signature dish of Chef Jack was just a little boring Again it tasted great But there was absolutely no wow factor The bar was set so high earlier on in the meal that the two mains were just average in comparison Service is spot on the staff are super cool and really do know there stuff We got the matching wine package which I think is better than getting a bottle"

    "review":"This is a gorgeous little deli tucked away on Lochrin Place serving the most delicious and incredibly strong coffee with a selection of tarts cakes and pastries to go Its filled with pretty unmatched polka dot and floral tablecloths which adds to its quirky charmI visited today and treated myself to a cafe au lait and a brioche to take away which came to a very reasonable 225 Incredibly strong and incredibly delicious coffee to the very last drop What I loved most about this place is the customer service displayed as the staff chatted away to a lovely lady who was dressed up with full hair and makeup for a wee afternoon to herself filled with coffee and cake while the staff conversed with her like an old friend A charming and delicious deliMade in France is far more than your average deli The owners have sourced everything in the shop themselves from independent French suppliers to give the customers a far more authentic French experience Real Toulouse sausages and Raclette cheese hang from the shelves between bottles of wine and vinegar For me though one of the nicest things I discovered were the tiny pots of apple puree that you get in every French supermarket but are impossible to find over here Basically its baby food mushed up apples in a squeezy pot but wow it just tastes so good It was only on my second or third visit here that I also discovered that Made in France hire out Fondue and Raclette sets too Having never had the urge to hold a fondue party I lie I always have the urge but I fear it would be a habit I couldnt quit Im yet to try one of these sets out myself but I bet it would be a lot of fun The shop prepares the cheese for you so all you have to do is melt it and dip stuff in Cheesy deliciousnessWe were out on one of those warm summery days and found ourselves searching for a wee sandwich shop in the area We had never heard of this place and decided to take a chance The decor was brilliant You feel like you are in a real french cafe You could tell that they took their food seriously as well as they had very rare treats such as a special pate and cheeses that you rarely see around I am not very familiar with French food but wanted to try the ever so famous Croque Monsieur Apparently these bad boys can go for 20 euros at the hotels in Paris Here however they are much more reasonably priced Basically its an open faced sandwich baguette with bechamel and emmental cheese Its grilled and the baguette gets a bit crunchy Croque Monsieur means Mister crunchy in France and the cheese toasted and even a bit burnt which I love cause its crunchy on top yet bubbly and beautiful underneath I asked that he put a bit of dijon and pepper on it which gave it a bit of kick LOVED IT They also have fresh squeezed orange juice which I have come to understand is quite difficult to come across in these northerly parts I cant even tell you how many times I have asked the waiter if the orange juice was freshly squeezed and for them to tell me yes yet  when I receive the juice it is clearly from the carton and not even tropicana quality ugh yes this is a pet peeve of mine but is it so hard to understand the concept of freshly squeezed juice Anyways they do have it here and I love that The price is reasonable and the place is quaint and delicious They also offer student discounts 10 offI have been coming here for years now and it never fails to deliver The food is amazing and I posting this too close to lunch time and I am too far away to be thinking about how good there sandwiches areI always opt for the soup and a goats cheesepeppers bagette The bagettes are rustic and the cheese peppers are a perfect combo to thisMy friend always grabs a Croque Madame whcih here is bechamel and cheese done over a grill She is never a big eater so I always fall air to half yep she is the perfect lunch companion The coffee is the main reason I keep coming back large cups of americano with swaths of la crema They really know there food and drinks here The couple that own the place are the nicest people you could meet Thumbs up from me"

    "review":"An interesting place where burgers are available in a number of sizes all of which are pretty big The food is very good quality and the lady who runs the place knows her stuff Its quite cosy inside but very small so youre probably best to book to make sure you can get a seatFirst off Ill start by saying that the burgers definitely live up to the hype A REALLY good burger is hard to find so its no surprise that this place has stood the test of time The person I was with also had a sundae which was delicious I gazed longingly but my stomach could not fit any moreHowever what really made the experience was the staff We went on a Thursday night and the place was packed there was one woman serving who was rushed off her feet but we got the most brilliant service and she dealt with some whingy customers very well My kind of placeA much anticipated visit to Bells Diner was a bit of a random choice for a Monday night but Christmas was extremely busy and I needed a good meal outWe had intentions of going elsewhere but when we parked up on St Stephen St And saw there were tables free I suddenly had the urge to see if all the hype of Bells was was justifiedSarah and I were quiet impressed by the wine prices first of all and were pleased we got a great seat by the window in the restaurant which was pleasingly busy for a cold blustery Monday nightOur server seemed a little unorthodox at first but really proved very competent especially given she was the sole server in the restaurant I duly ordered a 6oz mustard burger 950 with a side of coleslaw 320 and Sarah a 4oz garlic burger 750 I think The smell of the chargrilled beef instantly made you want to just stuff the burger into your gob The mustard butter in mine maybe lacked the stong mustardy kick I expected but was still pleasant and started the debate as to where offers the best burger in EdinburghSarah seemed to woof her garlic burger a lot quicker than I was scoffing mine down but that was probably because I was enjoying the wonderful array of sauces Bells offered on my chipsOK they were frozen chips I suspect I love Nobles handmade chips but they were fine and I loved the sauces as I mentioned The pickle lettuce tomato and red onion were all regular accompaniments for burgers but were fresh and decent and the sesame buns were good and didnt disintegrate in your handsI thought 320 for coleslaw was a bit steep and expected a small ramekin that could be consumed in a scoop so I was pleased when my bowl of slaw was presented to me and even more satisfied when I tasted the wonderfully fresh crunchy creaminess of the plate The decor was kind of random and minimal but i kind of likes it and loved the music choices of oldschool pop hits The superb burgers will stick in the memory and Ill definitely visit again but i still maybe prefer Nobles If I was looking for the best burger in the city theyre chips and buns are far better although they lack the range of BellsThis wee restaurant consists of a redwalled front room with a spattering of random photography and some sticky wooden tables: not exactly what diner usually calls to mind The menu is burgerheavy with various butters cheeses and sizes making up ones key decision points For the vegetarians theres a burger too Its lentily and nutty and tastes pretty good but doesnt hold together particularly well The accompanying chips are average but greatly accentuated by the fun tray of relishes and spreads that one can apply to them There are a good number of wines by the bottle and a few by the glass as well as an uninteresting assortment of bottled lagers on the drink menuThe hot fudge sticky toffee pudding wrapped up the meal nicely Service was friendly and helpfulBeen here many times over the years when Ive been a mood for a burger It never misses I even went on my first casual date with my husband here over 20 years ago Not sure if I can give it credit for that but who knowsIn the early days of our relationship my boyfriend insisted on taking me here The best burgers in Edinburgh he told me Located in Stockbridge which convinced me even more that he was correctWhen we got there I judged a book by a cover and thought this place Really Boy I was wrongBells Diner is so tiny you could miss it There is only a few tables inside and it reminded me of an old pub I think it was the curtains that did it Anyway the specialty is the burger There is a range of burgers to choose from ranging from cheese to garlic Being on a date we both went for the garlic of course And there is a choice of three sizes of burger Now I am not much of a meat eater but the boyfriend convinced me to go for the medium size while he went for the large Well the boyfriend was correct these are the best burgers in Edinburgh I challenge you to find a fresher more satisfying burger in Edinburgh I loved the tray of sauces that is put on your table it was a nice quirk and a change from the normal tomato sauce If you like burgers make a trip to Bells Diner but make sure you book"

    "review":"latenight party people on kebab quests hightail it here for what many say is the best turkish kebab in town order the largesize doner kebab and youll have to eat it with a fork i dare you to try to pick it up and i dare you to try to get more than a couple of napkins out of the them even though youll need about 20 this place is good and it may well be really good when youre drunk but ive had much better kebabsA lot of people really highly reccomend this Kebab House In fact I even had a friend who claimed he would eat one of Cappadocias kebabs sober they were that goodHaving come here after a night out I wasnt suprised to find Cappadocia full of others clamouring to get a huge kebab which seems to me all they do at Cappadocia  I heard the girl in front of me being told that they had nothing else other than kebab despite a whole list of things being advertised When I did get my kebab i was hugely dissapointed  there was faaar too much sauce even though i had specified just a little bit and the kebab generally was so greasy after a few moments of eating it my hands felt disgusting and my mouth even more so Now I know at this point many of you will think that all kebabs are like this but I wish to point out that I have had much better kebabs in my student life time that came from places with far less of a reputation for quality than this as cappadocias kebabs seemed somewhat tastless behind the lashings of unwanted sauceA disapointment greasy and rather tastlessCappadocia is perhaps not my favourite kebab place but it definitely does the trick if you fancy food after a night out Situated just around the corner from the University students playground George Square Cappadocia is in a great location for students to go for their lunch or dinner Cappadocia definitely specialises in kebabs but they also serve pizzas burgers and chips which is more up my alley I have come here several times for a burger and chips which filled a hole but it isnt the greatest fast food place in the area  I find their burgers to be really greasy and thin with just one tiny piece of lettuce in the bun which is somehow meant to constitute a salad I was quite disappointed with their chips too as they had clearly come straight out of a packet from the freezer and some werent properly cooked  not great There are a few tables and chairs to eat inside but most people order their meal to takeaway A student discount is available which is helpful and there is also a home delivery service on offer which is highly handy Cappadocia stay open till late so it is an option to go to for food on your way home from a night out but perhaps only if you are truly desperateIve only ever been to Cappadocia after nights out so I wouldnt like to put it down too much  However Im fairly sure its not the best kebab house  I remember asking the guy behind the counter for chips and curry sauce several times and getting told repeatedly that they dont do that  Fair enough  So I went for the house doner which took a pretty long time to arrive and cost about 3  When I finally got tucked in it seemed to take forever to eat  The meat itself tasted fine but the pita bread was so dry and big  The chilli sauce and mayonnaise which it came with were both tasty but there just wasnt enough to help with getting the damn bread down the hatch  I come here about once a month and Ill probably come again but I just prefer other places for the postclub munchiesSimply put  my favourite kebab in Edinburgh  I shopped around for kebabs for months when I moved there and aside from being in a great location Cappadocia nailed the kebab on every level  I cant speak for the rest of their food but the kebabs are outstandingPrice is a bit above average for a kebab place but the portions even for a small are pretty substantialKebabs that wonderful postdrinking polystyrene box of shame that is so wrong but sooooo right And in fact it doesnt have to always be postdrinking although that is when they taste best Sometimes it can simply be a late dinner when the autumn nights have set in and its dark and raining and you have The HungerSo on one of these nights when The Hunger had settled in and even the 5 minute walk home to make my own tea seemed too great a feat Cappadocia was there in all its yellowpainted glory 5 for a kebab with free chips I was promisedAnd thats exactly what I got Chicken kebab in a toasted pitta with salad and chips on the side And good lord that chicken kebab just didnt stop Just when I thought it was done and Id eaten all the chicken a whole other layer emerged from no where Mo chickenIt was around 9pm on a Tuesday and the staff were warm and smiling and friendly It was exactly as youd expect a good kebab shop to be Relatively speaking for kebabs the meat was good and after eating it whilst I did have a wee food baby I didnt feel overly full or yucky in anyway later that eveningI wouldnt say my favourite kebab and nor would I say make a pilgrimage across town to get one there are a few places in Edinburgh that are on that list but in terms of good value for money in a studentarea thats saturated with kebab shops Cappadocia is the best of the bunch and really really good value"

    "review":"This branch of the popular coffee chain is made doubly special by the fact that its adjoined to Blackwells the large bookshop on South Bridge Ive been in Edinburgh for a whole year and only realized last week that I could grab a book and read in comfort in Caf Nero Its a partnership Starbucks has had with many a bookshop and Im glad to have found something like that here in EdinburghApart from the slightly more laid back atmosphere for some reason books have the power to make people talk in more hushed tones the branch is the same as any other serving a range of coffee tea sandwiches paninis and desserts Im especially a fan of the book sections right next to Nero which include travel guides and cookbooks so I really could be stuck there all dayOkay so I know this place is a chain store And I agree with some of the reviews for Blackwells the bookshop to which this coffee shop is attached that an independent coffee shop would be far better But this Cafe sorry CaFFe Nero really is not bad as chain coffee stores go Normally I would rate somewhere like this 2 stars at bestThe reason for its elevates status seems to be its great location Attached to Blackwells is the best thing it could have done Reading a book while sitting down and browsing a book  you just picked off the shelf and dont even have to buy at least in practice if not in theory makes for a great time There isnt even the pressure here to buy like you would find in every other Caffe Nero Ive asked the staff before if they mind me just sitting and having some water and they were quite happyLike every Caffe Nero the food is way overpriced and the coffee is average I usually just get a decaf what have I become cappucino and sit for way to long whilst I read What makes a nice change too is the friendly staffAn otherwise bog standard chain coffee shop that elevates itself with its placement within the great bookstore Blackwells making it a an ideal spot for a quick coffee or a long readI love this Caffe Nero tucked away at the back of Blackwells bookshop Its the perfect place to duck into after some book shopping to browse through your purchases and relax with a decent coffeeYou can access it either from the street or directly from the bookshop so its perfectly situated if its raining outsideBecause its not positioned right on the main street it perhaps misses some of the passing traffic but thats no bad thing as it means that its usually quieter than the trendier Black Medicine coffee house the next block up Not that I dont like Black Medicine  far from it  but I find Caffe Nero has a more relaxing atmosphere maybe because of the proximity of all those booksFree WiFi tooUsually I really dont like chain stores chain cafes well anything too branded really However  this place is not half bad The fact that its right outside my apartment helps of course Because it is situated inside Blackwells its really rather nice to just spend a little bit of time reading and studying in here Its difficult to put my finger on the sore spot with this one The drinks are surprisingly good the staff is friendly yet somethings a little offI came here a lot especially when I first moved here been away for a while but am slowly coming back to it The coffee is sometimes burned but mostly surprisingly good and the staff is friendly and has good banterIf you sit here for long enough though it does get clear that this place exists to make money Its the difference in feel that you have between a chain store and an individually owned cafe Its not bad it just hasnt got much heart Sometimes you can tell that the staff really doesnt want to be there Well not much heart but good coffee I guess that just about sums it upI didnt realize this was a chain I thought it might be an independent coffee shop that was attached to a book shop This place doesnt really FEEL like a huge chain or anything every time Ive been in there aside from the Fringe festival it has had an intimate atmosphere and its a really nice place to check emails on a laptop or iPad and enjoy an espresso beverage I really like stopping in there and I enjoy the Nero Cafe card you get if you buy 9 drinks then you get the 10th one free Its been a while since Ive seen a card like that ever since Subway discontinued theirs a few years agoYou want to look at books while drinking coffee Check Want to drink coffee while reading books Check Wifi Triple check"

    "review":"This place is crowded at around 1 especially if the weather is good It has no seating area mind you and I have seen the que got outside Its good quality sandwiches and wraps provided as speedily as possible from the lovely ladies I really liked my chicken mayo combo and the bread was fresh which makes a huge difference Definitely a positive alternative to subway despite the difference in price it is worth itPut simply this place ticks pretty much all the boxes on the Good Sandwich Place listThey have a good range of predesigned sandwich fillings if youre not feeling creative but theyre also really patient if you want to make your owneven if you do keep changing your mind every two seconds like I usually doTheres the usual choice of whitebrownseedycrunchysoft breads to choose from as youd expect but the best thing is that when its full youll struggle to spend more than 3 on your work of sandwich artSpeaking of the fillings they order them all in fresh every day so you know youll never get any nasty surprises  no fizzy humus or brown lettuce like you get in other lunchtime sandwich placesBut the fact that they order it all in that same day does mean that if you go later on at lunchtime they are likely to have run out of the more popular ingredients Also theyre only open until 3pmish so if you get the midafternoon munchies then Picnic Basket will not be there to save the day Instead youll probably end up nipping across the street to Scotmid spending the same 3 on a prepacked sandwich and realising all over again just how great Picnic Basket really isI avoided this place all the way through my first year as I thought it looked and sounded expensive  I was so wrong  It offers delicious sandwiches baguettues and paninis at surprisingly reasonable prices  They have a massive range of fresh salad meat cheese and sauces to choose from  Further theres a great range of fresh bread ranging from seeded granary brownto soft doughy white  I usually go for the smoked turkey along with some lettuce tomatoes and mayonnaise  This only costs about 3 along with a drink and theyre certainly not stingy with their fillings  The staff are friendly and keen to let everyone know that their ingredients are mostly locally sourced and always fresh  I definitely recommend Picnic Basket for a tasty cheap lunchSmall shop with really good sandwiches Ive had a couple different sandwiches and all of them have been great Perfect place to get lunch for students  quick  cheapThis is a lovely little takeaway lunch place near the University of Edinburgh Ive been meaning to pop in for quite a while so Im glad I finally did The sandwich selection is large and vegetarians are certainly adequately covered by the choices on offer I chose a bacon brie and cranberry sandwich 280 for a regular size and it tasted wonderful The ingredients were fresh and tasty Service was quick and friendly and there are about three seats in the window if you want to sit in However Im certain the place is more aimed at being for takeawayFor a quick lunch at a great price there are very few better options RecommendedI discovered this place purely by accident  my usual lunch stop was closed for some unknown reason and I wandered disparingly into Picnic BasketAnd frankly I am glad I didNot only was it staffed by two of the nicest women ever there is a huuuge selection of premium high quality and fresh sandwich fillings to go with a large selection of different seeded cheese or whole wheat breads rolls baguettes The list goes on Personally i always have the same  the spicy chilli prawn cocktail on the brown seeded baguette AmazingThe trouble is that a lot of other people know how amazing this place is too  if you dont get there quick you will be at the back of a large queue and they wont have any of your favourate filling left"

    "review":"I would have given this place more stars if I could actually afford it on a regular basis This place is as authentic a sushi experience as you will get in Edinburgh Theres a proper sushi chef who youll see chopping and rolling and working his magic in front of your eyes Having been to Japan I can safely say that the service was authentically Japanese But then again I was only in Japan for a week so you should get a second opinion on that front Possibly by going there By there I mean No 1 Sushi Not Japan Its prohibitively expensive almost like going all the way to Japan for the meal But it was a great discovery since there were loads of things on the menu that Id never heard of and wouldnt be able to try anywhere else They also serve Kirin which is one of my favourite beers If youre feeling really lavish you should definitely go If youre not I recommend steering well clear of this placeOne of the disadvantages of quitting your job and moving halfway around the world is that until you find new employment funds tend to run rather low leaving you sitting in the house with not much more entertainment than the book on business youve been planning to read for oh aeons now But then a job appears on the horizon and after some salary glitches a positive amount of money appears on your bank account and what does that mean SPENDING TIME And I dont mean wisely I have sorely missed sushi since moving away from North California and so decided that my first splurge would be on a no holds barred revisit of one of the finest cuisines known to man My other half had never tried sushi before so my goal was to give him a one stop shop roller coaster of delights so he could try samples of everything and everything under the sun OK so perhaps I restrained my wallet a little but we did try:  miso soup way way way way too watery edamame a little over cooked but delicious all the same  and a hefty portion at that chicken skewer by all accounts amazing eel and salmon roe nigiri ok so the roe turned him a little green but he will learn oh yes he will learn Various rolls  Rainbow Dark Dragon eel and avocado is not a good combination at any level with grease levels that defeated us both Tokyo a chickenbased roll for the nonraw fish lover in the family and a classic spicy tuna maki Yes we ate too much Yes there were some bad choices in there but there were also good  notably the salmon roe nigiri  rainbow rolls Wasabi didnt make him cry and pickled ginger received a thumbs up while I drank all the sake at the table There was a fat bill at the end of the meal but considering the amount of food we over ordered I thought it was actually reasonable No 1 Sushi Bar reminded me very much of my Californian home away from home and when I get another occasion to celebrate I will most definitely be back againIm not expecting amazing Japanese food in Edinburgh but from what I had heard this was the best around so I had pretty high expectations However I was a bit disappointed by the quality of food I started with an order of the miso soup which was very underwhelming and actually some of the worst miso soup Ive ever had For my main course I had a chicken teriyaki rice bowel which was tasty and satisfying I also split some soft shell crab rolls which were excellent However another low point of the meal was the sake Granted it was only house sake but it was some of the worst sake Ive tasted It reminded me of leftover boiled rice water But it seemed like other people were quite pleased with their meals for the most part and I wouldnt be opposed to coming here againFound this place near my hostel so decided to give it a try I had katsudon which came with miso soup The soup was alright not as good as homemade ones The katsudon itself was decent pretty big and with enough meat and rice Nice serviceAmo molto la cucina giapponese ma questo ristorante nn gli rende giustiziaha di buono la posizione e la velocit del servizioma il cibo sapeva di poco e il pesce avevo qualche timore sulla freschezza nn credo ci torner tra laltro pure caro :I am a very big fan of this sushi place they are very tasty well made and filling I always stick with my favourites California roll and i am never disappointed i also tried the pumpkin croquettes appetizer which were really delicious and had the original ramen which I would definitely recommend the service a this location is nice and very smiley and polite i order for pick up and it was ready in about 10min which is greatTips  place is cash only and they have 20all their food "

    "review":"What a delightful surprise just up the road from my flat After a day filled with errands I decided a quick stop in blueberry was just the ticket When I arrived around two I very quickly realized I wasnt the only one with the idea for a pop in as all of the tables were full and there was a wee line in an already wee place What I noticed while I stood in line pondering what to get was the extremely reasonable prices Around two pounds for a baked tattie with some fixings Less for sandwiches Awesome If there had been a place to sit I may well have gotten real food but as it was I got a small latte and a piece of millionaires shortbread all for the extremely reasonable price of between two and three pounds Not bad considering how much one drink from Sbucks is The staff was very friendly despite being eyeballed hungrily by the line of folk waiting to be served and when I tried both my treats after leaving I was pleased as punch Both were perfectly lovelyHave already mentioned this place to the other half and will definitely be back to scope out the nomsGreat little cafe on the west side of the cityIt is small but welcoming and is fantastic for lunch with children and familiesThere is a great sense of community when you enter this coffee shop: walls are covered with drawn pictures by kids and opposite there are information posters about whats going on in the areaStaff are attentive and there is a very relaxed feel throughout the establishment One down side is that there is no WiFi availability but you dont need the Internet while youre tucking into their tasty home made food The cafe is inexpensive sandwich fillings are generous and cakes are delicious tooI couldnt believe Blueberry Hill wasnt on Yelp Maybe its because it caters for a breakfastlunch crowd but I love this little local gem and its an escape when working from home :Its small about 5 tables that seat between 2 and 4 at each but very popular with locals of all ages and can fill up very quickly as people pile in Does the usual cafe food: sandwiches my fav is chicken chorizo  lime pickle on brown gf bread but my mum swears by the roast beef which is cooked inhouse as well as soups and baked potatoes Specials change constantly and today included chowder baked trout and quorn chilli Cakes are homemade and cover everything from tray bakes to cheesecakeThis place is a gem  cheap but excellent fresh food  4 stars but only because Ive not had cake yet"

    "review":"It could be very easy to walk straight past this quaint little shop but it is definitely worth a look It is a unique shop to Edinburgh specialising in creating a Tibetan and Indian atmosphere The Himalaya Shop is primarily an art shop selling a vast variety of ethnic crafts such as hand made jewellery clothes candles and silk scarves There is a tea room in the back of the shop which sells traditional Tibetan food and has an enticing range of teas my absolute favourite is the spiced chai although it is a tad expensive at almost 2 a mug They also have a variety of homemade cakes which are delicious and the staff are always friendly and inviting  The Himalaya Shop now also have WiFi so it is great place to take your laptop and catch up on some workThe Himalaya shop also has a meditation room and a beautiful and peaceful garden in the back so it is great place to go to take some time out and relaxThe Himalayan shop is so amazingChilled out with a family friendly atmosphere the staff are unbelievably accomodating and very friendly They make you feel at home as your browse the Himalayan jewellery and hats in the shop and chat away to you as you sit in the cafe The cafe is particularly awesome I tried some of their chai tea which was lovingly made by a girl who was relatively new to the cafe She had moved to Scotland for a few months from Estonia so we had an interesting chat about uni and life in general She was very passionate about making me the perfect cup of chai tea  I wasnt brave enough to try the chilli in it this time but it had enough of a kick to wake me upAs much as their cushioned tea room was inviting with the lovely smell of soup wafting out from the pot and with their wooden seats littered with colourful cushions I had to go I had some serious reviewing business to attend to But I promised the girl that I would return to give her a verdict on the tea which I am now about to do  it was terrific Spicy and comforting I drank every dropI will go back to this shoptea room for sure  very unique and utterly delightfulI went into Himalaya to meet a friend and to hide another It was a surprise visit And we smuggled my friend in wearing a scarf and a hat and under the impression that we had done a good job But what a fail It was the first time Id been there and I had no idea what to expect but it was a really sweet space full of autumnal colours mainly their merchandise that I had to avert my eyes from out of a fear of buying everything at hand And when you walk in you might be under the temporary impression that thats that but through another doorway theres a sweet little cafe permeated in a delicious smellof chai and homemade food This ShopCafe is pretty much exemplary of a citys little secret Go on discover itLove the interior of this place Its so peaceful and calming It helps me to work my essays and I would love to come back here just to enjoy the masala chai tea They apparently made it from scratch so its definitely special The room has a really nice ambience with colorful wall decorations and instrumental musicThis was just what I was looking for Vegi tastefull food nice people not expensiveAnd in my neighbourhoodColorfull place as you would expect from a place called HimalayaTry it and youll come back for sureAlso opened on sundays starting from todayA great discoveryit is a tiny restaurant but as soon as you step in the door it feels as though you step into another world The decor is ethnic there is a fascinating shop at the back of the main room and the owner and his family are absolutely delightful There is an atmosphere of calm and although I was in a hurry the last time I went in the owner managed to make me a curry in no time flat so that I had time to savour it Although quick and efficient his manner was blissfully unhurried As for the food itself well its just gorgeous I have certain allergies and was able to discuss them on the first occasion and the owner was totally understanding and helpful in guiding me through the choices Im so pleased to have found this oasis of calm and will certainly visit it on many more occasions Highly recommended"

    "review":"Great as bagels are its quite rare to find a properly delicious one on UK shores Having not yet found a dedicated bagel shop in Edinburgh this small but competent outlet at Waverley Station will just have to doI tend to stick to the savoury side of things when it comes to chowing down on a bagel and usually opt for a regular or onion option with some sort of salmon concotion inside Whilst not perhaps as good as a proper bagel the scran on offer here is still fairy delicious though can be a bit wallet busting for what it is Sometimes its hard to justify the best part of a fiver for what is effectively a fancy roll when Boots and their 299 meal deal is just a hop skip and jump awayAs Amy has mentioned the bagels here are as close as you will get to real New York bagels in Edinburgh Theyre still not a patch on the real deal though but theyre pretty tasty and much more firm and chewy instead of soft and fluffy like the ones you get in most other placesThis place also has a perfect location in Waverly Station making it perfect if you need a snack before or after a train journey Ill usually get a tasty onion bagel before hopping on the train YumStill quite standard in comparison to NY bagels but they will have to suffice until I can get my next trip over the pondThis place is a case of letting your standards slip just a little bit for the ease of getting something to eat when you need itIm a big bagel fan and while I would rather go to a proper cafe or bagel place like Elephants and Bagels when Im rushing for a train and need something to eat quickly  this is the place I come There is a large range of both sweet and savoury bagels but If Im honest they arent the best I have ever eaten They taste just a little bit standard they dont really make me think wow Still as I said its a case of ease and speed And ok they do taste quite goodThis is a great bagel place conveniently located inside the Edinburgh Waverly train station  The staff are friendly and quick and nicely package your coffee and bagel selection for a quick carry onto your next trainOptions for different bagels spanned from sausage  egg and cheese to Salmon to just spreads  They had quite a few combinationsNext time I am back to this train station this will be my go to breakfast placeIm honestly really amazed that you can find such tasty breakfast sandwiches at such a reasonable price at the train station I had the sausage egg and cheese on a plain bagel which came out nicely toasted with melted cheese Its not the best breakfast sandwich youll ever have but for being in a train station its pretty much a miracleSometimes the need for a good bagel coincides with a wait for a train or no time to cook dinner so I get to have a Bagel Factory bagel for tea Im not sure why exactly but it always feels like a bit of a tasty treat As other reviewers note its quite hard to get decent bagels in Edinburgh The range here is good and coffee isnt bad at all I tried the new halloumi oneSome old favourites are missing from the menu but you just need to ask for those fillings and voila Its my fave place for takeaway food in Waverley"

    "review":"Good food and very friendly staff I have been back many timesThis place was just absolutely fantastic The service was impeccable as we had a party of eleven and they were extremely accommodating The food was also incredible You must go here its an experience you wont want a miss I would recommend not bringing children as this place does have a lot of explicit picturesI love curry but Kama Sutra may be a step too far Okay bad joke out of the way this place pleasantly surprised me Lothian road has changed a lot over the years I have lived in Edinburgh and I have to say its gentrification is almost complete Once I would have been skeptical of finding 1 decent place to eat on this busy street but times have changedSo to the curry my usual assortment of spicy and ricey madras chilli garlic and biryani have all been of great quality Rich spice flavours good quality meat and rice and nan which are perfectly prepared The staff are friendly and more importantly communicate with each other so everyone knows whats going on The takeaway is a little more expensive but only by a 1 per meal or so certainly not anything that would stop me returningOne small warning is that the Kama Sutra occasionally gets large bus groups so if you happen to head in after they have been seated you may be in for a slightly longer wait maybe 510 minutes more Still this isnt a regular occurrence and the food is well worth the wait This curry lover is happy to recommend the Kama SutraBest Indian in townAmbiance: Tastefully decorated restaurant with a moderate sound level even when full Feel like fine dining but the prices dont reflect thatService: Friendly and helpful One waiter got my order a little mixed up which could have been partly due to a miscommunication on my part but they were happy to correct it when brought to their attentionFood: Absolutely terrific I was looking forward to my trip to the UK largely because its hard to find good Indian in the US This place was exactly what I was looking for I tried the chicken tikka and the Hyderbadi Biryani lamb and both were wonderful Nice flavours without being too heavy The accompanying sauces were a mix  for the chicken tikka I found the sauce to be bland and unimaginative but for the biryani it was very tasty and well needed as the dish alone was fairly dry Oh and the naan is superbPrice: Very good value for the qualityAll in all if I come back to Edinburgh Id make the effort to come here againNote to self Edinburgh restaurants close early We realized it was 9:45 PM so asked hotel for a reco That said we taxied a few miles out away from the Royal Mile headed for Italian Darios I think Our driver said to try another Italian restaurant across the street but I saw the Kama Sutra sign beaming thru the rain and had remembered it scored high on Trip Advisor Indian actually sounded good so we gave it a shotThe greeterwaitercomedic hero seemed surprised but pleased to see us He seated us quietly aside from the two other patrons Menus wine please Navinder he had to spell and pronounce for me told us the specials and I asked for his recos During this time we chatted up and after we mentioned we were from Ohio the talk rounded up to hello Cleveland Quote for quote we went on Spinal tap I love him Back to the food I had a special starter the scallops which was the only low point of the meal A little overlooked so despite the rich Indian flavors a little hard going down From here out however everything else was fantasticMan had the Achari Bathak Tikka  duck marinated in Indian spices Divine not gamey and very tender  We split a plate of chicken stuffed dosa plain nan and another special  monkfish that was deep fried surrounded by potatoes and other steed veggies Oh my God  Delicious Man ate most of the food while I gabbed with the staff By this time Navinder was joined by another server the owner and the chef We ended up staying on much longer talking about everything form the city to marriage to movie trivia and closed the place with a special drink concocted by the second waiter I remember him mentioning elderberry something or other The chef was the sweetest man alive and truly interested in our feedback The owner was hilarious Just a joy to chat with I particularly loved his take on how important service is He also knew every movie I threw at him Rushmore  Come on thats impressiveWe got pix with the team and received a nice send off as we headed back in the rain to our hotel Sated and silly from a great night out Highly recommend this place and their original spot in Glasgow One of the best dining experiences ever Wish we could transplant them back to the states HELLO CLEVELANDBEST BUTTER CHICKEN in the whole wide worldOn our recent visit to Scotland we stayed at Sheraton Just as we stepped outside the hotel we spotted this Indian restaurant across the streetWe ordered Chicken Korma  Paratha for dinner When the Chicken Korma arrived on the table my husband asked the waiter for some hot sauce in order to spice up the dishlike most Indians would do The waiter went back and instead of the hot sauce arrived a very polite  cordial gentleman  Alok Singh the Manager of the restaurant Seeing we are Indians who might not prefer a mild dish like Chicken Korma which we had already ordered he asked the waiter to take the Korma away from our table He proactively offered to order a dish of Butter Chicken to us We both were a little startled embarrassed but definitely appreciated his gesture eventually Great customer service indeed Once the Butter Chicken arrived not only did my husband NOT ask for any hot sauce this time he heartily enjoyed the lipsmacking dish and inferred this is the BEST Butter Chicken I have ever had He meant he had never even tasted anything close to this flavorful dish even in any restaurant in IndiaWe couldnt help going back to Kama Sutra on the following night for dinnerand no prize for guessing  we ordered Cheese Naan  OF COURSE BUTTER CHICKEN :"

    "review":"Visited Atelier on my daughters birthday The food was delicious the service subpar The filet was beautifully broiled and juicy the duck delicious the two fish plates nicely done The chips were fat and fantasticThe service was not up to standard for any restaurant much less one of this pedigree First: I had specified that this was a birthday dinner when requesting the reservation I didnt expect anything special necessarily but my experience is that most restaurants will have a special touch  a candle on a free desert perhaps When we arrived the matre de mentioned the occasion but then the waiter asked if we had brought a cake because as he explained they dont usually do anything special We did not have a cake in tow He then whispered no worries well do something but something never happenedFrom then forward there were long delays between ordering and food arriving desert menus and subsequent orders and then finally the bill It is a small dining room but perhaps they need to increase the waitstaff by a person or two so that the quality of service matches the meal itselfAs far as restaurants go this is a very good example of attentive friendly service The food we had was very good We had the duck 3 ways for starters and steak for main All cooked to the desired level The portions are eh balanced Not to little but in all fairness certainly not too much I guess this is fine dining all in moderation I am sure if I asked for more I would have gotten it Scott who was serving us is a very happy friendly and helpful guy Though he is still struggling with the slate vs cutlery on clearing the plates I am sure hell get there some day :o I enjoyed it and it was a nice mealI visited for the first time this restaurant today with my colleagues It has been very highly ranked so that made me looking forward to it It almost full when we arrived just after 12:30 the order was taken relatively fast but its not the place you would go for an express lunch I would say The whole experience and serving of the food resembles the high class Michelin restaurants with big plates and stylish serving but not at a high cost at all: two dishes set menu for 1290 add a third one for only 3 I found kind of small the starter but very tasty  pigeon breast A big white plate for serving a flat iron steak It seemed small on a first glance but it was filling with a perfectly cooked steak double fried chips peppercorn sauce and the surprise of the day Wait for it Smoked tomato I dont know about you but for me it was a first and I found it delicious Homemade Tiramisu as a dessert with dark chocolate ice cream inside mouthwatering Must be the best Tiramisu Ive tried for quite some time Keep in mind: there was not an a la carte menu during lunch Quite a good selection of wines on the menu Beers only bottled including Peroni Joker IPA and a few others I would advise booking in advance to avoid disappointments Why not five stars Considering its a lunch menu and people from companies come over I would expect the waiters to be a bit more attentiveOn a whim I tried the 8 course tasting menu I was a little out of my comfort zone trying so many new foods  Everything was plated beautifully but the flavors of each dish really jumped out  Small sauted Scallops with tart lemon pure new potatoes and leek with a salty mussel and baked watercress topping was the first starter  Sweet and tartTender rabbit loin with shaved spring vegetables dusted with morel mushroom sitting in a sweet pea pure  Fresh flavors all in one dishMonkfish saffron potatoes surrounded by red pepper pure monks beard pure and tiny dabs of nduja spicy red sausage  This was my favorite The sweet monkfish combined with the sauces and a taste of the spicy nduja was a taste sensationLamb loin with salsa verde apricot zucchini flower stuffed with ricotta and battered broad beans and buckwheat served like a rice dish  Again the flavors went together amazingly wellDesserts included fennel cake with sliced rhubarb roquette pure mildly flavored cream with blood orange segments and saffron poached pear ginger ice cream a churro ball which was perfectly done and a small pot of warm thick chocolate saucemousse that was dark and sweet and bitter all at the same time  Tea and petit fours finished the mealI have not experienced such care in combining flavors as I did at with this meal Even if you are not an adventurous eater trust your taste buds to The Atelier You wont leave disappointedWe were here on our last night in Edinburgh  The meal was quite goodWe started with a spiced lentil soup  It was quite tasty  For the main they were out of the goat cheese pastry option so I ordered the cod  The fish itself was good but it was served on a bed of overly salted veggies  I think my bf ordered a risotto which was rather tasty as wellWe ordered sides with our mains  The Sauteed kale and the roasted potatoes are not to be missed  There sadly was no room for dessert   Its a nice place  I was happy with the experience  As I understand it the restaurant was 1 and a half weeks young when we visitedRecommendedGoing in I had no idea this was the type of fayre to be expected The professionalism and knowledge of the waiting staff was an initial clue but it was the starter that confirmed everything What I read was Panroasted Pigeon Breast Fois Gras Braised Cabbage and Apple jus what my mind conjured up was something epic what came out was something petit Barely a full breast and sort of skirting round the outside of my plate in a lovely fashion albeit as if it KNEW it was a little meagre even if it was very prettySo at this I despaired The starter was tasty the fois gras particularly so but I finished the course with the empty worry of a man who was going to pay a lot of money for not very much foodHowever then came the main course to the rescue  and a happy boy was reborn Loin and Neck of Lamb Sweet Potato Mash Braised Leek and Sweetbreads and Carrot Touille OOOOOFT What a portion What an epic epic portion When this arrived I realised how cleverly tactical the cunning Atelier chefs had been in their modest creation of the starter which had clearly acted as something of an appetite instigator yet not had the clout of a more gastro effort which might leave you struggling to put the main to bed This was glorious A stunning stunning effort and I enjoyed every biteThe missus dined on a couple of fish dishes that escape me now but were lovely in their own right And we shared a dessert of rhubarb But what a rhubarb There was a soft sweet cake there were marshmallows there were baby meringues and sorbet and jelly and little drops of flavour all over the placeA lovely meal Someone raised a valid point that the Atelier is not yet a Michelinrated restaurant so a question mark could rightly be held over the modest starters But in my case the main more than made up for it We had two courses each shared a dessert add drinks to the mix and the bill was 80Ive paid the same for a lot less qualityTwo thumbs up Cant wait to come back"

    "review":"I LOVE THIS PLACE Wings was so so awesome I love chicken wings so much and I was waiting to go here for such a long time Their staff is super cool and theyve decorated the whole place with geeky things like doctor who Jurassic Park and Star Trek They even have drinks based off of the evolutions of SquirtleFor people like me who care about price it wasnt on the menu but I believe that each bowl of wings cost somewhere around 3Im a big fan of places that choose to do one thing and do that one thing well Wings is indeed a great idea but that doesnt mean theres not room for improvementMy main criticism would be of the dry rub wings Id always though a rub was applied to raw chicken so that the flavours permeate the meat as it cooks This dry rub appears to be applied to the chicken wing after it was cooked delivery a flavour of raw spices Personally I wouldt order any of these options againAll other portions I tried were enjoyable but there is a sense that the wings are precooked reheated and then have a preprepared sauce applied Id really prefer to see everything made fresh to order and would happily wait a little longer for my food to arriveOn the whole I enjoyed the experience and will most likely return at some point in the futureIm not sure if they think they are too cool for manners but Ive never had ruder service Swearing at customers as they walk in the door is not cool If thats what they are going for then fine Sassy service that doesnt pull any punches can work in New York but in Edinburgh it made for an uncomfortable experienceI hope we can chalk it up to a oneoff because the venue is a marvel menu is creative and the price is right Just dont be a douche about itThis place is SO GOOD So many options for saucesdry rubs that will satisfy all chicken lovers They have a great range of spice levels and they even offer a suicide challenge for those who dare My personal favourite was the parmesan garlic sauce which was so delicious Additionally the staff were really lovely and gave us some good tips about what to do while in Edinburgh AND they let us play with the impressive selection of nerf guns in the shop The only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is because at 350 per bowl it is easy to get carried away and spend lots of money The wings although delicious dont really fill you with oneor even two bowls I left spending a lot more than my meagre Edinburgh budget allowedSi te gustan las alitas de pollo ste es tu sitio Cada plato trae 6 unidades 350 y t eliges la salsa de una carta con multitud de opciones El personal sper atento y agradable Uno de los camareros es espaol El local genial muy muy friki me encanta Tienen ms mesas en la planta baja La decoracin de todo el local es digna de ver Me declaro fan total de WingsAfter a day traveling around Edinburgh Wings was the perfect snack to fill my American wingloving desires Good atmosphere They had a movie marathon going on downstairs Service was pretty good too I had a magners and dancing in the bleu flame hot bleu cheese Ill be coming back sooner rather than later :"

    "review":"Whent here with my wife and daughter expecting an authentic taste of Mexico  what a let down   The nachos where dry and over priced and the burritos tasteless    Tacos were bland  wont be going back in a hurry  The reviews built up our expectations only to evaporate after the first dish appearedI used to frequent Illegal Jacks went it was on Lothian Road It managed to feel somewhere in between fast food and somewhere were you could sit with friends and have a couple of beers with your burrito There is no Chipotle in Edinburgh and Jacks managed to do alright as a substitute After a hiatus Jack reappeared in Saint Patrick Square I was here earlier in the summer soon after it opened and unfortunately had not been very impressed It seemed to be lacking a lot of the charm that it once had and the food had been below barI tried again and found things had improved or I had just had bad luck the first time It was a lot quieter which helped The burrito was pretty much what I expected it didnt blow me away but then again its still a burrito at the end of the day and you can only do so much I went for the Carnitas pulled pork  it was good but it could have been warmer At 8 its not the cheapest meal but it is pretty sizeable Their spicy salsa seemed pretty fresh but it didnt have enough kick of my likingThe venue itself definitely lacks compared to the one on Lothian Road It feels a lost more like a fast food place and not somewhere you would want to meet with friends They are making the most of a small space though If your after a burrito well there isnt much choice I dont think Jacks doesnt have quite the same appeal as it used to but I much prefer it to Pintos offerings so I will give it 4 stars rather than 3 Los Cardos on Leith Walk would still be my number 1 thoughTop notch fast Mexican style food Walk in and youll find a till for you to order your food at and you have two options  eat in or take out If its busy find your table first then queue A really decent haunt for tasty Mexican grub The burritos are ridiculously largelike I could club someone to death with it large If youre just a normal human being level of hungry then order the small one The carnitas here is really tasty and the salsas are tasty too The tacos Im assured were equally as lovely The only thing I would say is that a token few tortilla chips on the side wouldnt go a miss Other than that the service is friendly The food arrives quickly and its pretty yummy Pretty much all you need to know really Oh the parking around the restaurant is seriously lame so factor that into things when you head here You may be better off catching a cab or bus :The prodigal son returnsSo jack is back a dash of novelty mixed in with a bowlful of comforting familiarity The new place on St Patricks square is a lot smaller than the old place on Lothian road so Id advise booking ahead I bet this place fills up fast For those that remember the decor of the old place would probably agree the new spot has a warmer and more rustic feel too it and certainly doesnt have the this used to be a Pizza Hut vibe about it As for the familiar theres ACDC blastin out the stereo and the food is rich and filling My burrito was a little imbalanced with mostly rice down one side of it but when I managed a big mouthful I got the amazing fresh salsa guacamole and juicy chicken all together which was lush If you loved jacks before then youll be delighted its back If you werent then I suspect the new spot wont win you over Jack has a dream and he wont let a silly little thing like his business getting liquidated get in the way Jackaholic4lifeIt feels a bit harsh to give Jacks a three star but its not as good as what it once was  I am going to give the crew a second chance at some point as I visited during the first couple of weeks of opening so Im hoping by now they found their feetIts a smaller place than the old one on Lothian Road and it does feels a little tight in places plus the noise carries a little from other dinersLike Paddy I do agree on reserving your table as it does get busy at peak periods  Jacks team are more than happy to do this via twitterLike I said Im not writing this place off and Im still wanting to go back and be wowed  I really want to be wowed  Just my quesadilla wasnt really rocking my world this visit and Im just hoping it was because of the festival crowds and the first few weeksIm pleased that Jack is back and didnt lie down too long and let his dream fadeOK this is quite possibly the best burrito in the UK  This is seriously to the standard of the best American burritos I have ever had So I should probably quantify everything I was never lucky enough to try the original illegal jacks From the moment the kickstarter opened on for new investors to help open the new improved restaurant I couldnt help but put a few quid in  Until today I hadnt managed to get over to try their magnificent produce They are about a 15 minute walk from the royal mile but well worth the trek  Rough and ready interior but it suits the venue and the atmosphere The staff are amazing really nice polite and know their stuff  The food is unbelievably good  A nice menu with lots of choice  A good selection of beers and soft drinks And the prices are in line with Edinburgh rates for good food Get down to jacks and enjoy"

    "review":"This was my second experience with the PizzaExpress juggernaut and both experiences have been pretty good I first visited the Euston Road location in London and experienced the same entirely decent pizzas and service I got at the Leith location this evening The thincrispy Romana pizzas are reliably good and not overwhelmingly filling even though they look HUGE when they come out I had the goats cheese Padana and its decent While I too choose to eat in local eateries whenever possible sometimes one finds oneself in mall or a late night situation and this chain is perfect for that Even if you are a vegetarian and thats important for my family The standout bit about PizzaExpress is the kids menu A three course meal with choices almost any kid would appreciate and my small people are considerably picky Even the hot milky kid cappuccino at the end pleased them So if you have a large group youre stuck for food its getting late everyone is cranky and hungry head for this chain They will sort you out I checked into their background and found nothing really worrying about the people who own or operate it If all chains were this good they would not have such a bad repHigh five for the quick and friendly serviceWe both had the sicilian lemonade which was really lemony and sweet just as it should beThe pizza was well I guess ok  it was a nive thin base but could of done with being a bit crisper on the base  It was tasty thoughIts just another chain in another shopping mall but it was alright I guessPizza Express you get the same pretty much everywhere dont you It boils down to do you like the place the service as the food will be relatively the same unless the student cooking it is REALLY bad It always seems to be students so if not please dont take offence At New Year we stumbled into the Ocean Terminal branch and tucked into some pleasant enough New Year menu fare complete with Bucks Fizz Neither of us expected much out of the place but we came out of it with that bemused feeling of hang on were in a shopping centre in a chain restaurant and it wasgood Eesh didnt see that one coming Its never going to win awards but to be happy enough to pay for food these days is sometimes an impossible task so well done PE you just raised the bar alright so the bar is near the ground but whos askingOnly ended up here because I wont go to Frankie and Bennys and all the other places had big queues this xmas eve eve shopping day lunch time HAD to eat somethingTable for one One pizza One more example of a terrible frozen spinach being stuck on pizzas  Im pretty sure last time i had a fiorentina it was fresh spinachHardly a jot of mozzarella cheese the egg was poorly cooked and also the only part of the pizza smothered in  pregranulated parmesan type stuff  I had my water ate what I could read my book chilled out as much as I could in a place almost entirely populated by under 5s and left Its not hard to at least say goodbye but about 6 people didnt to me Hey hoBO RINGThis restaurant is alright but I much prefer its cousin at Fort Kinnaird The only advantage this one has over the Fort one is the sea view Other than that the seats are plastic the restaurant is freezing this is the case for the entire centre except Debenhams and it is ALWAYS busy Also my pizza was cold by the time it got to meThis restaurant has improved vastly since my last visit The seats have been replaced with better quality ones and the dcor seems to have been spruced up a bit We were seated in a completely different area than before The last time we were here we were at a table in the back by the toilets and I couldnt really enjoy it because of people going past our table to get to the toiletsToday we were seated in the front by the window that backs up into the mall We were given an entire bench to ourselves which was nice of them to do I ordered a margarita pizza and the thin and crispy version is SO much bigger than the other one They seem to give you a bit more topping with the thin and crispy version I almost couldnt finish it and had to have a little break halfway through Once I did finish it I felt like I was about to burst It was such a filling pizzaThe toilets were clean the service was efficient and we were given a good seat The only problem is that there was a pizza making party going on and 20 little girls kept making a right racket when I was trying to enjoy my mealThis Pizza Express wouldnt necessarily be my favourite they have taken my comments on board and improved their restaurant Maybe the Victoria Square Pizza Express will have as well"

    "review":"Sambuca is a lovely little Italian restaurant on Edinburghs CausewaysideSambuca specialises in traditional Italian fish and steak dishes but with a modern twist  the restaurants namesake drink is poured onto the dish and set alight as your meal is being served  a truely wonderful sight However as to be expected this often leaves an odd aniseed taste which has only worked with around half of the dishes I have eaten at Sambuca That said food is very delicious and well pricedIf you are willing to ignore the need for a decorater Sambuca is a nice restaurant to go to for somehting a bit differentA cheap and cheerful Italian restaurant very good for a date I came here on a date and even though the tables are a bit too small and crammed in I really liked the mixed seafood pasta I got and would gladly come here again The waitress who served us was friendly too I have only come here for lunch when there is no lightingdishesonfire practice I have seen them alight at night though quite entertaining If there is a big group of you I would strongly suggest booking a table as space is limited Also tables are quite close together and there is little space on the tables for dishesFrom the outside Sambuca looks a bit run down and could probably do with getting redecorated inside as well  However this certainly doesnt reflect the quality of the food and service which the place has to offer  The staff are welcoming and friendly whilst the restaurants general atmosphere is relaxing and chilled out  They pride themselves on serving authentic Italian cuisine and aim to specialise in seafood  Consequently some of it is a bit expensive but its all delicious filling and tastes just about no time to arrive  I opted for the Spaghetti Marinara which had a whole range of seafood from squid to clams in a white wine sauce  I would definitely come here again and Sambuca offers great food and service in a pleasant atmosphereA little favorite of mine Sambuca sets th standard for Italian restaurants in EdinburghIf your on death row and they decided to give you your last meal from here you need to get the Gamberoni You have never tasted king prawns this meaty before and the sauce is excellent Garlic and Basil I think We were given 2 glasses of wine by our very nice waiter on the house and the total bill came under 25First time in Edinburgh so of course we go to an Italian place Logic A Anyways this place is absolutely fantastic Somewhat small but plenty of tables and a great atmosphere Clean modern and doesnt feel crowded Staff are very friendly helpful and are easily accessible but not overbearing in the slightest Food was delicious spaghetti marinara with seafood and white wine sauce was excellent as was the lasagna al forno and the tiramisu is fantastic 1010 would recommend Bon appetitWent there this evening I have friends who live above it and none of us had been As I say went with family this evening Very nice interior and bright evening sun coming inI had seafood marinara one of my fave dishes It was lovely Nephew had a stagione pizza which looked lovely My father had minestrone soup which he enjoyed A  very nice little Italian and very reasonably pricedWould definitely go back  House red was also very drinkable"

    "review":"This tiny little shop on Dalkeith Road was a pleasant find Studying or at least trying to in Pollock I felt hungry but didnt want to walk far I found the Sandwich Shop on Yelp and popped out to have a look The interior is absolutely tiny with only two little stools to sit on I imagine most people take away The menu boards are however extensive As well as serving breakfast rolls all day you can have a sandwich with a huge variety of fillings I chose a hot steak baguettePrices are great and you can even get a sandwich crisps and drink sub 4 Top quality The place wasnt busy when I went so I was served very quickly indeed and I was back to studying YouTube before I knew it RecommendedI hadnt eaten all day It was 3:30pm A very unusual situation for me Every other eatery along my NorthWestbound walk was closed I walked into The Sandwich ShopThe Sandwich Shop is like most Scottish establishments of the same nature tiny eating area and carbheavy food But one way it differs is selection although primarily offering breakfast rolls served all day and sandwiches the possible filling combinations are many Relatively rare items such as jalapenos abound Another way it differs is value For just over 5 I got this: a sausage link breakfast roll a small soup of the day tomato and chorizo sausage a salami sandwich with lettuce and jalapenos in combo form alongside a bag of salt  vinegar Walkers crisps and a bottle yes bottle not a can of sugarfree Irn Bru All that for JUST OVER 5My meal filled me up and that is rare But heres the kicker Yelp the woman who made my sandwich she literally covered it in jalapenos This was not a typical single saladtongfull of four or five slices spread over the length of the sandwich She carefully placed the jalapenos in a spicy blanket over the entire surface area Perfection For a tiny cheap sandwich shop THE Sandwich Shop lives up to its name"

    "review":"This bar  kitchen  grill is right bang in the middle of cowgate where it is happening especially during the weekends  The establishment is divided into 2 floors  Ground floor is the main bar area with long tables  chairs for food  Upstairs are more seats for restaurants and some sections are good for groups as seats are curtained off for a little bit of privacy  I believe there is also a small area for private group  There is also a grilling section of the kitchen here and you can watch them cook while you drink  I had my leaving do here and what they do is they give you a big section downstairs for your group to mingle around  Towards 10pm on a weekend there are also DJs to pump up the atmosphere  Staff here are great and extremely helpful too  They also have a good selection of beers and ales which is always good for after work drinks  Prices are reasonable high Edinburgh prices  The food is mainly western carb  fat laden and grilled meat  The item I have tried here a couple of times is the lamb chop and it is highly recommended  Right proportion of fat and cooked how I liked it  I didnt have the pulled pork but my colleague had this twice in 2 lunches which says how good it is  The baby back ribs is slightly on the dry side so maybe avoid this unless they improve  Food can be a bit slow to come out so suggest come here when you are not rushingI was attracted by the cute shepherd dog brought by other guest inside so I came into OX184 Great and dog friendly pub for grilled foodOpted to finish this a while back to get a bit during the Festival Granted maybe not fair to review this after a Festival visit and I dont think they had been open too longbut I will just say a few things They were nice enough to seat 6 of us with no reservation It was obvious how busy they were and the place is massive so I dont think that makes it a picnic to serve in when rammed We ordered drinks and some food I had a veggie burger which was nothing special and lacked a sort of sauce I appreciate most places offer a veggie burger these days but my general experience is that they arent very good and this was no exception I sort of wish places wouldnt offer something that isnt going to be enjoyed by people who actually have no other option to eat it Now I do understand it was busy so it could have easily been just wanting to get the food out but maybe a BBQ joint isnt the place for me to eat a veggie burger anyways I might go here for a drink again but prefer smaller quieter placesFirst and foremost the fantastic tap list was just what I was looking for Henry was amazing and attentive The staff worked with us and our large party and everyone was happy with their food Well be backJust went up to the bar to ask for a menu as we have been seated for a while and had no one address us and was answered with: I cant talk to you now Im making a cocktail The barman proceeded to talk to his colleague the whole time so evidently he can multitask and it wasnt until another barman came and offered his service that I was able to get a menu Unimpressed The food has yet to be tasted but hopefully its better than this idiots attitudeOkay Have just eaten and Ive gotta say the food was pretty good A big thank you to our waitress Ruta for being accommodating and amiable We had 2 people with intolerances with us and she made sure the dishes were safe to eat The other staff would do well to learn customer service from you RutaIt looks super trendy from the outside and inside even more We had a lovely waitress whose name began with a K who I would recommend to ask for to everyone and anyone Its super hip the bottom floor has more life as it is open great place for large parties The inside is very modern with a base shade of dark grey which is lightened with intense blue purple and yellow Upstairs is perfect for groups up to four as it has smaller tables there Amazing interior here as well with transparent fabric creating a soft division between groups The food is divine and is fairly priced with an interesting variety The barrooms are clean and fresh which is always greatly appreciated The staff are kind and always around so one is never left wanting for longGreat place for trendy people of all ages for sure"

    "review":"While offering a wide range of fast food besides their speciality chicken Eshas leaves a little bit to be desiredPersonally I would advise caution when venturing away from the chicken as you are not assured of what you may actually get Upon ordering a fish supper I was provided with a thin morsel reminiscent with what I expect to find dished out during school dinners or to be found in the frozen section of Farmfoods To rub salt into the wound the chips were very thin and undercooked Perhaps I am being unfair given the price range  Eshas offers a number of deals presented on their front window including at one point a 10 inch margarita pizza for 199 although I believe this deal has since ceasedOverall this place is perfect for the hungry student venturing back from a booze up seeking something with a high grease content but if your seeking something with a bit more quality to constitute as an actual meal it may be best to look elsewhereEshas is not the best takeaway shop I have expereinced in Edinburgh thats for sure  Eshas is situated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street just a short walk from the University and so it is a handy place for students to pop into to buy their dinner on their home from classes however Eshas is not the best takeaway shop on Nicolson street to go into Eshas menu is incredibly diverse offering dishes such as pizzas burgers curries and baked potatoes I came to Eshas for dinner several months ago with a friend to buy a pizza and we had the ham and mushroom which was absolutely nothing to rave about The mushrooms were really soft and appeared to have dissolved into the topping mixture and the pizza base was quite soggy and burnt in places  not nice My friend also ordered a portion of chips which were a far cry from the traditional Scottish chips we were expecting  these looked as though they had come from a frozen packet and not a good one at that The prices are very reasonable and a 15 student discount is available You are able to order your meals online at Eshas website and they also offer a home delivery service which is convenient   The staff are friendly and perhaps some of their other dishes are tastier than the pizza which I hadI have to admit Eshas is a guilty pleasure of mine Edinburgh offer few fried chicken shops and many of the ones is does contain close early Not this fine establishment though Eshas is one for you drunkards out there Open until 1 and 2 on the weekends it is handily situated along the road probably frequented the most by students South Clerk Street and they undeniably make up a large part of its clientle being much busier late at night than at any other timeEshas does not just limit itself to chicken though there is a plethora of late night goodies Also purveyed are curries pizzas burgers and on occasions kebabs The chicken is the star of the show though with loads of different types and deals The fillet burger with included hash brown is a particular favourite especially with the spicy sauce Generally the chicken does have a tendency to be a wee bit dried out and make sure you invest in a drink as well as it saps all the moisture out of your mouth However to counter this niggle if you time it right and get there just as it is closing often you will be regaled with free chicken or massively reduced prices My flatmate came home last week with glee written all over his face as he proudly thrust a ludicrous amount of chicken at me to share 15 pieces for 2 he proceeded to brag you cannot argue with that And to be fair hes got a point"

    "review":"I dont order takeaway very often Im a bit of a diet conscious health freak and most takeaways no matter the variety tend to be very high in salt and sugar glazed with grease and fatNow Im not going to pretend Delicious Italian is the healthiest restaurant Huge portions of white pasta covered in cheese sauce But the quality here is such a cut above the average takeaway that it makes the occasional treat worth itReally the takeaway from Delicious Italian is no worse indeed sometimes a lot better than many other well established Italian restaurants Its interesting to see another reviewer recommend the rigatoni normali with aubergine and ricotta I quite agree  about this delicious dish Ive tried some of there other vegetarian pasta dishes and all have tasty but I still come back to this dishA great place not badly priced with quality food above most takeawaysAlthough the last few times Ive been here the pizzas have been a tad burnt and the prices have gone up its still my favourite pizza  pasta takeaway It looks unassuming from the outside and is tiny one you step inside but dont let this put you off the food is excellent In Scotland it is hard to find a takeaway that is not covered in grease or has been repeatedly deep fat fried yes pizzas included but Delicious Italian thankfully avoids this Cooking genuine thin based Italian style pizzas you wont find that the pizzas are too stodgy They taste amazing as well with my particular favourite being the parma ham parmesan and rocket but I have a horrible feeling this may have been taken off the menu recently You can also create your own from the ingredients sitting in the deli style counter They also do pasta dishes and whilst I know the carbonara is great I have yet to sample the others Going up to about 7 ish for a pizza is a bit more than it was before but if you want Delicious Italian food instead of grease then this is the place for youIm still coming to terms with how cheap the Marchmont restaurants are Ofcourse such a statement is always made comparatively and its unfathomable that one could have a relatively fancy meal out in New Town for less than a tenner Itd be easier to understand if Marchmont was run down and rats came as a side dish to the food but this is thankfully not the case Marchmont is lovelyyyyyy So this Italian restaurant yeah is well good They serve the typical menu of starters pizzas pasta fish meat and chicken dishes I especially like that the pizzas come in two sizes and more importantly two prices depending on the belly satisfaction and pocket ofcourseI feel so blessed since Ive moved back to Marchmont last April We live surrounded by two awesome pizza places and Delicious is certainly my favourite of the lot My flatmate another yelper and I usually get a Fresh 16 pizza for a tenner or just a bit more and indulge ourselves in the flat with a nice bottle of red to accompany thatFriendly service reasonable prices fantastic pizzas Takeaway only Note that theyre going to move across the road to a slightly larger venue I assume well be able to eat in thereIll update my review if I get a chance to try their pasta by the wayThis is a dangerous pizza place to have in your neighbourhood  Proper yummy Italian pizzas Yum yum yum  Maybe a bit on the greasy side but hey ho  Apparently their pasta is fab too although I have not tried itThe staff are friendly  Student discount is also available  Great value for a takeaway anywayFinally takeaway pizza thats not at least 10 inches thick with a disgusting stodgy base and hardly anything elseDont get me wrong its still fast food and its still greasy but if youre going to get a takeaway pizza from anywhere you could do a lot worse than get one from here Its slap bang in the middle of studentville so prices are really reasonable as youd probably expect: when I lived in Marchmont my flatmates and I would share one pizza between the four of us and not only would we be absolutely stuffed at the end wed each have spent less than 5 If you really want to they do have one or two tables for ou to eat at but to be honest the only reason I can think of for anyone to do that would be out of sheer hunger and impatience preventing them from getting home before they start tucking inIf only all those other pizza delivery chains were half as good as this place"

    "review":"This is a delightful rustic wee Patisserie offering some very tasty authentically French bitesI stopped by mid afternoon for a latte and some snacks Although they still have some freshly made croissants and pain au chocolat on offer I tried one of their paninis I decided to break out of my Mediterranean eating habits and ordered a sweet Thai chicken filler Not only was it really reasonably priced but it was also delicious The tangy gently spiced chicken was appetising without being too overloaded with sauce It satisfied my hunger cravings without bloating my belly upI got mine to takeaway since it was quite full inside but if you choose to sit in and arrive at the right time of day its a very mellow yellow environment The walls are painted a gentle creamy yellow and its bespoke design and slightly bohemian feel is very appealing You could almost believe you were in MontmatreThe staff were friendly and I can happily report their sweets were delicious Aside from doing healthy smoothies they have a lovely selection of cakes I had a macaroon swirl and not only was it a tasty sugar rush but it also cleansed my palate Tres BienIf you come in to this brilliant little patisserie be aware of three things First the clientel are all either old or up thier own arse but rarely the two Secondly  if you can get over the first point you will have stumbled upon a brilliant and rather beautiful shop come cafe that serves some wonderful food in a pleasent environemnt and relaxed atmosphere Thirdly  if you can bring yourself to leave difficult dont expect to have a small bill  I find this place very expensive for what it isYou have been warnedDiscovering a new place can be deceptive  the first time youve gone in its with a sense of expectation or mood that youre carrying  So for example when I first came upon Patisserie Florentin I was in a sad mood and its yellow walls sunflowers and wee back room with framed window facing onto a sunfilled walled garden was altogether a bit magicalIf going back knowing what to expect however its altogether a different story  you have a reference point for disappointments that occur again like the one member of staff who is so lovely and polite and with such a lovely smile that the others seem sullen not just curt in comparison  You notice that the service isnt great on your second visit and remember that last time it took quite some time to get your order taken and more time to get the billAnd you start to notice the other things that you either really do quite like  the pastries and bread in baskets on the wall and the overall French feel you do get from the cafe if not always from the food  and the things you arent so keen on  the one or two members of staff who seem preoccupied with anything but serving customers and the slightlywarmerthantepid coffeeStill Florentin does have atmosphere  maybe thats something that you bring with you but at least a little of the welcoming sunflowers also rubs offI tried a couple of quiches there and they are good Nothing spectacular but for 5 pounds you get a small quiche and a side of salad Decent enough for a light lunch The coffee is really good Do not leave this place before trying their cappuccino or their wonderful espressosI am a fan of this little cosy patisserie and would definitely come again for some cakes and baking however not so much probably for their baked potato again :D While I think they have very reasonable prices for the cakes and tea which probably make them favourite from locals my potato was very dry  it didnt have really much filling in itBut yes I must go back for some sweets when I am around :Ooh la la la Patisserie Florentin We stopped by here craving tea and cake Staff were friendly giving us a warm welcome as we took our seats in the back of the cafe which was decorated with elegant red curtains and ornate paintings It had that authentic chic Parisian cafe feel and was a great stop for a chai latte Always Sadly it had to be my third choice of cake as they didnt have any carrot cake and were all out of almond croissants but I was eager to try an authentic french fraise With layer upon layer of marzipan fruit and cream and a strawberry on top it was perfectly light and fluffy and generous in portion size MmmIts worth noting that they welcome dogs when we were in there were LOTS so be prepared for that I personally love it when business owners welcome dogs but have only been familiar with this in a bar or pub environment previouslyTea and cakes and dogs Cest merveilleux"

    "review":"Interesting  Some fairly vanilla rooms which are reasonable but one or two very old woodpanelled rooms with gorgeous decorative plastered ceilings  Presumably a over a hundred years old  These come with fairly ageing fittings but worth it nonethelessI would never consider staying anywhere but the Parliament House Hotel when visiting Edinburgh  Were I suddenly and miraculously endowed with enormous fortune and had the means to stay at the finest suites at the RitzCarlton I would still prefer the charm of the Parliament to the grandeur of the RC  The rooms are spacious for European hotel rooms and impeccably clean with deliciously comfortable beds the bathroom was enormous with excellent waterpressure in the showers and as previously mentioned plenty of hot water the location was superbonly a few minutes walk to the train station and many wonderful pubs and attractions and Calton Hill right across the street offering spectacular views of the city and the Firth of Forth the restaurant served delectable foodthe vegetable terrine had us bewitched a parlour with all the warm and welcoming character of the Victorian home youve always dreamed of in your rosiest fits of unfounded nostalgia with wood panelling and squashy armchairs and a perpetual cheery fire in the grate a toothsome selection of regional whiskys and other hot beverages to soothe the spirits and kindle the heart but best of all by far was the staff  Every person from the desk attendant to the chamber maid to the server in the restaurant was a delight to interact with an a true comfort to the traveller  Every staff member clearly worked their tuchus off seeing to the needs of their patrons but never once was their kindness friendliness and attentiveness detracted from in the slightest bit by any hint of weariness or indifference  One truly felt a welcome guest in the home of an dear friend  No matter how much we had done during the day when we came home in the evening we took the time to relax in the lobby with afterdinner drinks and a chat with whatever receptionist on duty and it was some of the most delightful time we spent on an imcomparably delightful trip  Cannot recommend highly enoughThe rooms are decent and cleanThe breakfast is basic but not included They have a half decent selection on their menu and there is a breakfast buffet with cereals croissants and sometimes muffins The service is slow so make sure you have time if you order anything from their menu My main complaint on this hotel is their internet It disconnects all the time and sometimes for up to half an hour at a time Its just really unstable"

    "review":"Unless you are looking for a completely uninspired breakfast experience I would give the Gateway Restaurant a miss I had heard that lunching here was recommendable and so I hoped that perhaps breakfast might be worthwhile Of course the venue is beautiful located as it is in the John Hope Gateway But warming the croissants could not mask how stale they were The Aberdeen buttery did not seem much fresher The stacked Scotch pancakes were unimaginatively presented Do not expect the wait staff to be able to provide any details about the presence of nut contamination in any of the food  despite the menu stating that they will  The reason that our waitress could not give us any details about possible nut contamination of course was because all pastries are bought in from outside This is not the first time I have been confronted with this issue and I still find it unacceptable that a restaurant even if a food item is brought in from a bakery cannot furnish the customer with details of ingredients or other information relevant to the food item Most disappointingly I suppose was the fact that the food was not made in house Why is it that a restaurant cannot bakemake its own food I assume that they do have a kitchen and cooks I know from personal experience that a scone a pancake a loaf of bread are not complex undertakings in the kitchenI cannot fault the wait staff they were pleasant enough Though some training from management might have been in order for our poor waitress was most thoroughly stumped when we asked her to enlighten us as to what an Aberdeen buttery was  Pleasant service though cannot make up for poor quality food So if you want to impress outoftown guests serve them a nice breakfast at home and head straight to the botanic gardens bypassing the Gateway RestaurantIt wasnt planned for lunch but some things are good left unplanned Yes Im saying its goodAll three of us ordered something from the sandwich part of the menuPortions were big So tick for value Tasty too so another tick We ordered Mayo but original waitress forgot it and we had to reorder Service average speedy Its really a nice setting but it does have an open feel about itPoor Museum cafes are always going to be a bit of a fleecing but to be a fleecing with such rotten service is very special indeed The food was soso 9 for a sandwich and chips with these presented in a silly pretend frying basket Hate that The main issue was how glacially slow this entire proceeding was Our kids ice cream never arrived and the excuse was an overwhelmed kitchen staff In a half empty restaurant It was more likely to be a poorly managed kitchen and poorly trained staff We asked to pay without having received our childs dessert We were not charged for the dessert  I asked the manager what the deal was and she said they had let in too many people who did not have reservations Smells like bull to me Dont bother The Botanics is always a nice treat but step out of the place for a snack ReallyOn a hot Easter Monday afternoon we swung in here for afternoon tea It was meltingly hot in the glass framed building and we were desperate for a drink of water and looking forward to a proper tea service But thanks to the waiters to seemed to idling around chatting we couldnt order anything and after a while sweating in the heat got bored So left The manager kindly noted that I left my bag but didnt bother to ask why we left without ordering Oh well"

    "review":"Pleasant atmosphere great choice if youre staying out by the zoo and dont want to go to the hotel restaurantAt first the menu looks like it falls into the trap of having too many items but once you focus andor ask questions the choices arent as complicated as other Chinese restaurants tend to be I had Chinese curry and a side of noodles and tried the szechuan beef with Singapore noodles as well The curry was both something I had never had before and exactly what I was craving Noodles cooked perfectly much fresher tasting than they often are Also the curry had a decent amount of heat though the staff seem cognizant of varying tastes and I had to reassure them that I was okay with hot food As for the beef it was above average in tenderness and flavour The whole meal was extremely satisfying and I enjoyed the staffThe food here is legit  great portions full fresh flavors wide varietyso very good  We were staying at the Holiday Inn across the street in need of a good meal within walking distance and saw this place across the street  so happy we stopped here We were seated very quickly in a comfortable little nook  Reasonably priced too  just go youll love itFriendly nice staff that are quick to help and great Chinese at an affordable price I live close by and I regularly go here as its very good food It gets a 5 star in my bookOpted to go here as we had a lovely night away in Edinburgh and wanted somewhere new The reviews for this place sold it and it wasnt too far from our hotel We book with 30mins notice which wasnt a problem and when we arrived it wasnt that busy but was a Sunday night The staff are friendly and a little over attentive if you can get such a thing As I am pregnant I had to first check that the king prawns had been frozen before being cooked and the waitress looked angryconfused why I would ask this Even when I explained I need to know as I am pregnant and can only have them of they have been frozen first she looked as if I was trying to catch them out lol Finally se got it and laughed about it and luckily I could have my king prawn curry which I craved : Food was lovely large portions and good menu I found my starter of shredded duck with salt and chilli was bland and dry no kick tbh and I had to dip it in some soy to get a flavor My husband loved his salt and chilli squid and his chicken satay main I would go back again but would opt to try new places firstWhat is it a lime flavored beverage  A Japanese poprock band  A shade of wall paint by Glidden  No Cool Jade is a Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh the last restaurant I would review during my vacation and the best Chinese restaurant Ive ever visited there or anywhere  The range of choices the quality of delivered dishes and the overall dcor cannot be praised enough  In less than two hours we enjoyed a range of Asian dishes Id never seen in the many Westernized Chinese restaurants Ive visited in my home town and Ive been to them all   Unfortunately without an online menu or even a website its difficult for me to detail the specific dishes ordered at Cool Jade so Ill have to go on memory and photosThe dcor is classy presented as a topnotch bistro rather than a brunchbuffet location where casual eaters shovel chow mein and chop suey via forks and ladlesized spoons into their distended stomachsyeah I admit having a tendency to offend those that support and promote westernized Chinese restaurants because Ive been to China and tasted authenticity first hand   I get asked often to recommend Chinese buffets but for me its like requesting a favored Arbys locationthey are all the same and the quality can be graded on the same scale as your next bowel movement which in this case arrives fast and definitely furious  Cool Jade is exactly what I have been wishing for since my trip to China so many years ago so manyokay it was six  The initial plate was a collection of appetizers including crispy seaweed sesame cakes spare ribs egg rolls and deep fried dumplings all resting on a warming plate  After that we were served up shredded duck with pancakes spicy beef and noodles  There was no real entre for each sitter just a collection of plates the both of us shared from as it should be and how it actually is in many cultures across the world  The meal was fun and satisfying but it was the more authentic touches I appreciated like the plasticwrapped towelette or the fact that the chopsticks were plastic  I hate plastic chopsticks but its one thing I clearly remembered from China  Wooden sticks are a luxury of the west given our amount of timber  Or how about the carrot carved into the shape of a pagoda temple or the other one in the shape of a flowerYeah a pagoda temple that level of detail  This attention is not often seen in Westernized Chinese  I had been teased about Cool Jade for weeksabout how good it was superior to other restaurants like it  Having experience in this field I know why because they dont compromise  They dont pander to the tasteless cultureless masses  Westernized Chinese food is for people without culinary curiositywho think that eating Chinese is them upsetting the normal order of hamburgers steaks and potato chips the staple daily diet  Cool Jade is not selling to those people  This is for people who when they leave their homes and eat out they want something special an event worth remembering  Its what I want  Its what I got: a fantastic experience on my last day in Edinburgh  Of course the meal still had to end with fortune cookies  Some things never changeDid I mention there was a carrot carved into the shape of a pagodaDECOR:  9PLATING: 10SERVICE:  8FOOD:  9VALUE:  9OVERALL:  9 out of 10Having spotted this on a bus into town from the Edinburgh Capital Hotel the previous day I thought I must give it a go After a day at the zoo you work up quite an appetite its hilly We headed over the road to dine As Chinese is a favourite of ours we were looking forward to this meal after all the previous reviews are singing its praisesWe walked in to a lovely ambience of gentle background music and were shown a nice table in the windows The staff were really friendly and politeWe ordered Peking Ribs Lemon Chicken Fillet Steak Cantonese Style Chinese Greens and Young Chow Fried Rice This was easily enough food for 2 hungry people The quality of the food was excellent and great flavours possibly the best Lemon Chicken Ive ever tasted and theres a long list to rate againstThis was washed down with a few lovely Tsing Tao beers If Im ever in the area again Ill be returning here"

    "review":"I think Ive finally learned the difference between Nepalese and Indian food Whenever I see a menu claiming to be Nepalese I always feel a bit cheated to see familiar things like Biryani and Tikka Massala on there but apparently the difference between the two is that traditional Indian dishes are much creamier and coconutbased whereas Nepalese is based around tomatoes and lentilsThats one of the things thats so good about The Ghurka  you go for a curry but dont leave feeling like that girl in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory who swells up into a giant blueberry and has to be rolled out of the room We went for lunch where you have the choice of the  la carte or their 595 Set Menu A main from the  la carte costs about 69 so we thought the set meal looked like great value for money Also you got a choice of at least 5 or 6 different things for each course and it wasnt a buffet which is always a bonus With your main course you had the choice of whether it came with rice chipati or poori and I have to say their poori are easily the best Ive ever eaten in my life When the waiter set the plate in front of me with 2 huge ones on it I thought I was never even going to get close to finishing them both myself I didI cant review this place without mentioning this one thing though: on the lunch menu although you have a choice of loads of different meatsfishprawns and you can choose the spice level its still just described as chicken curry or lamb curry etc It doesnt exactly give off the most exciting impression of the food although when it came we did all agree it was deliciousAlso this is an ideal place to go for a chilled out relaxed meal I wouldnt eat here if youre in any sort of rush as the service wasnt the fastestDefinitely worth a visit thoughFriendly enough and good service Menu is OK but not very exciting Interesting to see Nepalese dishes though these ate not super exciting A good local curry house DefinitelyWe needed something quick to eat before the cinema  so we thought wed give this a tryThe service was efficient  the food was really tasty I had the chicken dhansak and it was one of the best Ive had in ages If youre in the area it is worth checking out"

    "review":"I am very surprised to see this restaurant described as average I ate here as part of a package I got when I booked a stay at the Glasshouse Hotel and I thought the food was superb I had scallops to start risotto for my main and crme brule for dessert and everything was divine Unfortunately I cant remember the specific fancy twists to each dish but the whole menu was based around Scottish cuisine with a contemporary twist The atmosphere is very modern and chic with the orange lighting and panoramic windows giving stunning views out over Edinburgh Unfortunately service was quite slow but the restaurant was jam packed so I guess it is maybe to be expected After dinner we moved over to the bar and had the most delicious cocktails I have ever tasted You can pick anything from the cocktail menu and it will blow you away but if you see nothing you fancy the bar staff are experts and you can just tell them the kind of thing you like and theyll rustle something wonderful up for youThe Forth Floor is THE place to come for cocktails in Edinburgh Everything about this places screams style quality and exclusivityYou get to the Forth Floor so called because its on the fourth floor and has amazing views out to the Firth of Forth and over to Fife weather permitting by taking a lift from the Harvey Nichols entrance on Multrees Walk There is something a bit special and slightly eerie about being in a department store at night especially one as fancy as Harvey Nichols The food in the restaurant is of excellent quality but it does come at a price Youd be wiser eating in the Brasserie and saving your money for the cocktails The barmen here really do know their stuff when it comes to mixology The list of drinks is comprehensive but if there is nothing that takes your fancy on the cocktail menu then tell them what you like and theyll create something magical for you Herbs are ground in a morter and pestle and youre encouraged to have a good sniff as the ingredients are expertly mixed up in front of you Once your cocktail is made its served with a wee dish of nibbles thats replaced as soon as youve finished them Ive been known to get through quite a few of theseBring visitors from out of town here to wow them with the incredible views of Edinburgh it looks all the prettier with a delicious cocktailIve been to the Forth Floor Restaurant many a time courtesy of my mothers preference for Harvey Nicks browsing and kind invitations to lunch on a fairly regular basis Ive enthusiastically consumed both lunch and dinner here so can attest to the fact the food is ace along with the cocktail menu which is pretty snazz tooFishcakes always good Caesar salad the classic lunchtime favourite also never a letdown The ribeye steak and frites also the target of a good wolfing down in the past Nothing on the menu here has ever offended me or has really ever been bad in simple terms One of the biggest pulls of the Forth Floor Restaurant and certainly one of its most striking points is its top floor location overlooking St Andrew Square plus you even manage to get a wee peep at Fife as well On a good clear sunny day when youve got time for a leisurely lunch whether liquid or not who wouldnt be keen for an outdoor seat on a balcony from which you can gaze at the awesomeness that is the Edinburgh skyline You know you wouldOk Ok  I have to be honest I came here as part of a relatives birthday celebrations and as such realise that there is very little chance that I would be dining here again unless somehow I manage to shake off the fact I am a debt riddled studentThe Forth Floor is classy And exclusive And oozes style from every one of its glass topped metal finished surfaces The food is simple sublime  from what I could tell it seems to be modern Scottish cuisine and it really is delicious The coctails however are better  just give them a try Trust meThis restaurant isnt average as some of the other reviews have called it  its amazing but sadly I dont think I will be back for a whileThis restaurant is one of Edinburghs gems It has brilliant views of the city form the balcony and is really quite coolIt is split into two parts one slightly cheaper and one more expensive but both are really wonderful The food is amongst the best Ive had in Edinburgh and the service is unfaultable is that a word As has been said the cocktails are to die for My mum and I are actually in the brochure in hotel books sitting at this bar sipping Martinis  no autographs pleaseSeriously one of the best places in the city If you want to come then be sure to book though My gran has trouble eating some foods so we didnt really know where to take her for dinner when she came to Edinburghbut we took her here and she loved it Especially the mashed potatoes for some reason10 out of 10The service here was terrible  Multiple waiters not knowing what each of them is doing   However the food WAS pretty good  But dont go here if you are really hungry the portions are quite small  The view is really nice and the overall atmosphere was great  They just need to get better at waiting on tables"

    "review":"My goto delivery pizza  Its like a restaurant pizzabut delivered The below mentioned are the most recent ones tried and I enjoyed them all  Special note to their specialty pizzas of the month: they are oftentimes a hit in my book  With random ingredients sometimes thrown in youd be weary at first but give it a try its a home run Capricciosa: All that jazz of ingredients worked their magic on this oneNduja: Oh that Nduja bewareit really is a spice spike Between the sausage  onion it works well with the flavour combo  But it was pretty salty  Would have been better if less so but guess its expected with there are two types of sausages on top Montanara: The truffle oil did this one for me  I love mushrooms but the truffleflavour was a smackalicious end to it all Primavera: a classic pizza with good prosciutto and still springy rocket  Slight cons would be the soggier bits in the centre and the longer delivery time but not a dealbreaker  Can put up with that for better dough Whichever you get all ingredients are fresh atop a generous sprinkle of good cheeseHow cool is it they also deliver wine for you to pair with your pizzaannnd they have their own ice cream :DToo long have I been eyeing that tiramisu on the menu  Next time Im gonna pick you upIf Im looking for a bit of a takeaway treat then it has to be La Favorita You can not go wrong with their pizzas my personal favourite is the primavera pizza and I love that the rocket topping comes in a wee bag to stop it going soggy before it gets to youMore than the pizza the croquettes are amazing Whoever came up with the idea of coating macaroni cheese in breadcrumbs and frying it deserves a medal Be warned though more than one croquette and you wont manage your pizza never mind have room for a dessert Never fear the croquettes keep well and make an excellent lunch the next dayI think my absolute favourite thing about la favorita is the delivery cars Cute yellow fiat 500s I secretly want one In fact theres no secret I want oneImagine my joy when I discovered that La Favorita have a branch in Morningside Im closer to Old Town than Leith so when I had a serious case of the hungermunchies and was in need of pizza tout de suite voila La Favorita pizza delivery Yes I realise the irony of writing about an Italian restaurant with flutters of FrenchThey have some really delicious unusual toppings That evening I pipped for the Rosa with chicken and peppers and one with spicy sausage mushrooms and truffle oil Nice thin base plenty topppings that seem freshly prepared huge strips of red pepper rather than cut up wee cubes One wee thing  the way they cut the pizza was weeeiiirdddd Not the usual symettrical even triangles No no It seemed to be cut in thirds but then at random angles I made for fun inventive pizza eating pizza sandwich but just a bit oddThey warned us they were busy so itd be a 65 minute wait which is always nice to be told thisI would say it wasnt quite as good as the original La Favorita on Leith Walk But this isnt a criticism as the original is one of my favourite pizza places EVER The pizza here was still delicious and half an hour later there were two very empty pizza boxes NomAmazingly Id never eaten La Favorita pizza until this branch opened in MorningsideSo when it did open I was on it  Friday nights have become pizza nights in my household rock and roll I know so one Friday I insisted The Man should drive in I didnt realise at that time that they would deliver to my house in the sticks and I ordered pizza online for collectionThe only thing was when I ordered for collection I received an email and a text confirming my order for delivery  So I ended up calling totally defeating the point of the online order to confirm that they knew I would be collecting my food and not having it delivered  A minor glitch but the confusion was fair It seems that their automated messages would be better off reworded so the customer isnt left wondering how theyll receive their foodOther than that we collected our amazing pizza and endured an agonizing ride up the road with the delicious smell of pizza filling the car  Yumyumyumyum is all I can say about how they taste  I ordered mine wild mushrooms and rocket with truffle oil and luxuriated in its gloriousness  The Man got a spicy meaty pizza which I actually found rather unspicy but he enjoyed itNext time I would opt for delivery and Ill definitely be ordering again for a Friday night treatSolidThis time I ordered the larger pizza which was only a quid and a bit more expensive and some italian lemonade and i was in heaven The larger portion is the real deal Its value for money Really recommend doing it and if I can eat that whole thing so can you and it was delish And the wee one liked it too Take out Pizza with out the grease The pizzas from La Favourita are amazing  fact MY favorita is the Capricciosa with extra anchovies followed by the Tiramisu We had them last night after an afternoon of gardening which works up an appetite and a half I can tell you Two large pizzas between three and we were happy garden gnomes sat in the sun with a bottle of red Lovely"

    "review":"Such a great wee pub hidden away behind Waverley station It is a great place to go with friends when they come from Glasgow as they can nip across the road to get the last train home There is always a great atmosphere in The Doric The staff are always really friendly and the live music is amazing Certainly a place to visit time and time againWhenever the train Im meant to be getting in the evening is delayed I usually end up in here  its very handy for the station and never very busy those are probably its only two discerning features though The bar is the kind of faux traditional that a large percentage of Edinburghs pubs are its cosy enough but not particularly welcoming or friendly The aussie barman generally looks like he cant be arsed and would rather be somewhere else Sydney perhaps with a schooner of Toohys New to be fair I dont blame him as this place seems to attract more than its fair share of confused tourists Mostly though I am irritated by the price of the ginger beer: it costs near enough the same as a pint of ale which in this day and age of responsible drinking is wrong wrong wrongThe Doric is apparently Edinburghs oldest gastro pub and it sells its legacy to the local tourists Within its a nice warm tavern complete with ales aplenty and stodgy food on the menuIts always been quiet enough when Ive visited but thats usually when Im waiting on an early evening train Im unsure what this place is like at the weekend but I can imagine it being a lot busier with functions and whatnot Seems to attract an older crowd who seek out its own brand of peace and quietThey offer homemade pies Sunday roasts 2 courses for a tenner and the food is good nosh Along with catering for my gastro belly they have a couple of pasta dishes available on their A la Carte menu which will be suitable for vegetariansTraditional in a modern pub grub kind of way and certainly more serene than the sometimes uptight Edinburgh cocktail scene the Doric is great for a meal and a catch up over a few cold onesMy dad is obsessed with his Good Food Guides and Good Pub Guides etc and so hed read about this place and was always banging on about going next time he was up here visiting me Im not going to lie from the outside it just looks like any other old man pub and from glimpsing into the downstairs bar area on my way up to the bistro thats pretty much exactly what it looked like on the inside too The bistro bit though was a vast improvement and the food was surprisingly good despite the stuffy atmosphere and the set menu was really good value for moneyId definitely go back here for food again but for drinks there are so many other places for drinks less than two minutes walk awayWonderful classic pub Came here for dinner on our first night in Edinburgh After a quick but cold walk from our hotel on the royal mile it was wonderful to settle in in a cozy pub We did not have a reservation but they were able to find a table for us and had a seat at the bar upstairs and ordered a pint and a glass of wine while we waited The beer was delicious theme for me in Edinburgh and the people working there were very welcoming The food was classic pub food and was top notch we ordered fish and chips and shepards pie and it was perfectGreat location near the station but you do kind of need to stumble upon it or know where you are going as it is just outside the touristy hustle and bustle of the Royal MileWe went with a group of 10 and had to prepay 5 each to make a reservation which then was taken off our billI just had the salmon started which was really delicious although the bread was not toasted and quite dry which was a bummerMy friends had many different dishes and all said it was great Good place to know and Ill almost certainly go back you can get some real typical Scottish dishes here when you have nonlocal visitors over that would like to try them"

    "review":"Edinburgh needs more genuinely local eateries  Bijou is a small but friendly cafe off Leith Links  Been around for a few years now and has continued to evolve through a change in management  Good quality basic menu most dishes in 3 sizes with some good specials  I like the friendly feel that welcomes you for a coffee or for food  Kids welcome tooMagnificent meals and eveningThe menu flavours of each meal  I loved my grainfed chicken  the atmosphere the wine selection and particularly the warmth and genuine good nature of the owner host all led to a five star family dinner This evenings visit to Bi Jou restaurant has made our visit to Edinburgh Thank you so much for a brilliant meal and evening Happy anniversary to this clever owner and his talented staff Bliss Affordable bliss at that And the wine listings HILARIOUS yet true Visit for those and the quality of the meals if nothing else Thanks to Trevor our concierge for his suggestion  a superb choiceThis little place was my first meal in Scotland I just arrived yesterday and walked over to Bijou Bistro since I knew it is just down the road from the guest house Im staying at Thanks to Yelp and the reviewers for helping me find this little gem This cute little eatery has wonderful atmosphere and charm Since I am travelling alone I appreciated the small table by the window where I could enjoy my meal while watching the parade of people and cars go by The music was enjoyable and the lady working there is such a sweetheart She made me feel so welcomed and took excellent care of me The food was top notch as well I definitely plan on returning for another meal or two before I leave next week Thanks for the great introduction to Scottish hospitalityAlthough just minutes away from bustling and slightly scruffy Leith Walk venture to the eastern part of Leith Links and youll find a completely different atmosphere  Here among the gracious pillared houses that line this part of the park you feel as if youre in a quiet and genteel suburb  Bijou Bistro which aptly describes itself as A Local Eatery fits right in here a caferestaurant that is a hub for well todo mothers with small children in tow calling in for a coffee and a piece of cake during the day or couples enjoying a selfindulgent brunch at the weekend  There is also a full evening menu where each dish can be ordered in one of three sizes bijou medium or main a slightly gimmicky innovation but one that does allow those with small appetites or budgets to try a few different items  The only thing Ive tried so far was the veggie breakfast which was generous and satisfying made more enjoyable by the establishments laid back vibe tasteful decoration and large light windows looking over the Links  This is certainly a nice place meriting a return visitMy kids and I have spent an extraordinary about of time in this lovely local cafe so much so it feels like an extension of our kitchen  We tend to use it for breakfast and lunch but know that it does a mean evening meal too  Good breakfast menu with all the classics including as couple of sizes of full Scottish  Lunch feels thoughtful and a cut above standard cafe fare  fresh seasonal ingredients interesting combinations  Occasional storytelling evenings bring a community feelA hidden gem This place is friendly welcoming and warm The menu may be a little on the small dare I say bijou side but they change it regularly and there are always daily specials on the board in addition to the menu itself The food is excellent  have not had one unpleasant experience It has a BYOB for a small corkage fee if you want to take advantage of this  or indeed the cheapest Peroni in EdinburghLove it"

    "review":"Hmm is it normal for a place to bring your bill after you order drinks When youre sitting at a table This really annoyed me Do I really look like the type to do a runner  Dont answer that:Went here for a few Vinos with my brother and his friend The ambience isnt particularly great but it was early Having been here before I know its a nice place for a glass of wine especially at night when they darken the lights a bit Unfortunately we were full after our afternoon tea I say unfortunately as the cheese and charcuterie boards looked great I always forget about this place for food For me its more of a watering establishment but then I see the menu and think I always forget about this place And so it keeps happening Its ideal if youre meeting someone for a catch up and nibbles or prepost lunch or dinnerHidden wine bar just off Charlotte square with a lovely selection of wineI really like this place it is hidden behind Le Petite Folie in a beautiful building with a glass roof  The selection of wine is great and the staff are very friendly The wines are in a huge display over the bar and there is also a little balcony area that you can reserveIt seems very popular as an after work drinking place as it is full of businessy types from about 4pm The food is distinctly average but not bad for the price  Some reviews say its overpriced but I cant agree  the shared platters of charcuterie and cheese are pretty good very filling and only marginally dearer that a chain pizza from round the corner The homemade soup delicious too I say give it a tryA grown up drinking den for those of us looking for a more sedate and relaxed boozing experience Great selection of wines cozy but modern atmosphere and some comfy chairs make Le Di Vin one of my preferred places to have a drink and a chat Good music in the background to complement your evening Its very nice here indeedThe clientele tends to be older with plenty cash in their pockets good hair and tailored jackets So its probably not everyones cup of tea but for relaxed atmosphere and some good glasses of wine Im happy to chill in the company of some Range Rover ownersLe DiVin has recently appeared beside its French counterpart La Ptite Folie a restaurant that has long been an established and frequented culinary establishment at the west end Le DiVin is all about wine exploration so if youre the kind of person that likes to try two or three different wines of an evening or possibly more then this would be a good place to start You can get pretty much every wine sold here by the glass bonus because it can be really annoying if you venture somewhere and there are about two wines sold by the glass none of which youre keen on There are times when ordering a bottle of white wine to yourself is not a good ideaactually you should probably never do that because its probably classed as a cheeky bit of binge drinking With more than 60 wines to choose from this is an extensive and really well varied menuYou could also add to the Frenchness by ordering a cheese board or some charcuterie items and the bar serves other light bitesLe DiVin has gone for a traditional fairly relaxed look so its not one of those wine bars thats overly polished and too stylised for you to feel comfortable and enjoy yourself The bar area looks great with the wine bottles stacked to the rafters and theres a fair bit of table space plus a small mezzanine floorThis hidden away bar sits next to Le petit Folie in the West End just opposite Sygn barIts got a great atmosphere Comfortable seating A lovely long bar area to sit at and an upstairs area It has a huge montage painting of various French and Scottish famous people try and guess them all  some of them are very difficult to work outIt mainly does small light bites and sharers for food It has a great and varied selection of wines to try out by the bottle and glass There is certainly an over 50s type that frequent this bar but that is not to say not go if you are younger I think its a lovely place for a quiet drink during the week and to catch up with a friend or for a dateIt can get busy with financial types after work especially WednesdayThursdayFridaysThe croque monsieur is delicious as are the various charcuterie and antipasti dishes The food is quite pricey but definitely high qualityWill certainly keep going thereMrs M and I popped over to Le DiVin for to celebrate some good newsWe shared a Les Planchettes Charcuterie and Cheeses and a bottle of Klein Kloof Chenin Blanc from South AfricaThe Planchettes was a Medium sized platter meant for two and whilst the food was delicious the portion was IMHO was very small The Cheeses were very wonderful and everything tasted so freshWe washed it all down with some Chenin Blanc which went oh so well with the foodAs the portion of food was er shall we say a tad on the tiny side We plumped for Les Tartines  Goats Cheese Red Peppers and Jambon de Bayonne which was delicious I love Goats cheese and was not in the slightest disappointed with thisThe service was good although when we asked the waitress for some Balsamic Vinegar she clearly did not understand us and instead brought us a small bowl salad dressingAll in all we enjoyed ourselves and I give LDV 4 Stars"

    "review":"Other than the lack of an apostrophe theres very little wrong with this establishment  service was good although the thought that we might have wanted food after having longer to study the menu whilst our teas were being prepared seemed to get lost somewhere decor is pleasant some very comfy chairs to stretch out in and it benefits massively from the large expanse of window facing onto Frederick StreetFood and drinkwise there is nothing on the menu that you wouldnt expect from a cafe of this kind so if youre after a surprise or a new taste sensation youll probably be out of luck but whilst not breaking any records they do what they do wellHaving not checked out the toilets on this visit or the food for that matter Im hedging at 3 stars but would expect on current evidence that either of those things would easily push it to 4 the next time I pop inWe were on the lookout for somewhere to set us up for a morning of walking around and also to ease the slight hangover those delicious cocktails had left us with standing opposite Fredericks I pulled out the Yelp App to see what was near seeing Fredericks on the map opposite us we decided to look for it a quick glance up and down the street left me confused until I realised a tiny sign and a door leading to a flight of stairs that would take us to Fredericks Inside was lovely and airy with nice dcor and comfortable chairs We luckily got a window seat as the place started to fill up as we were ordering The food was simple and did the job They served everything form your usual full breakfast to cakesLike others have said without the trusty Yelp app I would have walked straight past this cute little coffee shop in the central location just behind Princes street Once inside on a Sunday afternoon I was quite surprised to find it packed of the jam variety The server was very sweet and managed to find me a table in the corner giving me a great view to people watch I was feeling peckish so thought Id make use of the breakfast served all day on a Sunday which is such a good idea and had a Scottish bacon and poached egg butty for a very reasonably priced 450 one filling would have been 350 It was a good butty the bacon and butter being the highlights but my egg was slightly over cooked and I never received my explosion of yolk that is essential to an egg sarnie in my opinion  I also managed to grab a window seat after some other people left and had a view of the castle whilst enjoying a latte The menu offers single and double shots for all drinks which again I think is a nice touch to accommodate a more differentiated experience My coffee was very nice this the atmosphere the value for money and the location means I will definitely be backTasty breakfast in a secluded second floor location Well made coffee and friendly service Will come againLocated smack bang in the middle of town so handy for catch ups and a cuppa before having to run for the train or bus Feels a bit lacking in soul to me and was also quite cold might be due to the huge windows without double glazing brr Tea was fine Again this is a coffee place so it seems their tea is a bit less of a central thing It was a standard tea bag in a pot Just you know fine Would come back due to location as so centralGreat breakfast Organic scrambled eggs with smoked salmon is a lovely break from the usual Scottish breakfast Good coffee  decor and nice light  view of Frederick St"

    "review":"A good place to take kidsIt sells good foodjust the same as any other mcdonaldsThe staff were polite and helpfulIt isnt to pricey as its affordable food at a great qualityIts just your typical mcdonalds but it opens early practically in Waverly Station and unlike other McDonalds in the UK the Cloud provided free WFfi actually DOES work quite wellThis is just a regular branch of McDonalds with everything you would expect on the menu The good thing about it is that its rather large so even if you go in at peak time during lunch time you will generally always find a seat Its nice to sit upstairs and watch out over Princes Street Its also a prime location if you find yourself shopping on Princes Street and find yourself in need of some refreshmentYou do need to watch yourself in the queue though as the entrance is quite small so if everyone stands in the one queue youll be queuing along the Street so watch out for chancers trying to slither there way into the front CheekyOn a recent visit here I was clumsy as ever and we experienced Frieageddon as I spilt all my bottled water over GBots chips and they were left drowning in a watery grave OopsAs has been said before me this is just a typical MacDonalds restaurant but its quite a good one It has a really big seating area upstairs and plenty room for the masses However past 10pm this place can be dangerous I have often felt really intimidates by all the teenagers hanging around and later on all the drunks Its a good enough place for lunch or an early dinner but I wouldnt come here later than 11pmAhh Mc Ds how many times you have helped me in my pursuit to kill off a hangover McDonalds is a real favourite with students because they do a great deal where you get a free hamburger cheeseburger or McFlurry with every meal that you buyI sometimes attempt to have a half decent healthy meal by choosing from the deli menu but even these probably pack a good punch when it comes to calories When it comes to choosing a drink I normally opt for a  tropicana or a bottle of water  with the meal instead of fizzy drinksThe Waverley McDonalds is usually pretty busy but actually less so than the one just off Princes Street as I dont think as many people know about it nestled away in the corner of Princes Mall and with an entrance on the Waverley StepsOrdered a simple mayo chicken but the cashier forgot about us The food sat on the waiting belt the whole time until I was able to get the guys attention People in after us got their food first The guy was super polite but very forgetful The location isnt busy"

    "review":"Finding something different amongst the hundreds of chinese indian or italian restaurants in Edinburgh can be a challange  however located near the citys university Namaste Kathmandu may just be the place you were looking forSpecialising in both Indian and Neplaese dishes there is no chance of you not finding something you want to try on either the main or lunch time menus  or at least thats what I found The Daal which I ended up settling for way fantastically presented and thankfully tasted as good as it looked With a large dining area as well as a private function room for up to thirty guests Kathmandu is a great place for a different night outIt was our second visit at Namaste Kathmandu and second time we were not disappointed Moreover I must admit that the meal was even more AMAZING Absolutely delicious and full of flavour food waiters who are very caring but not importunate good prices nice decor Its a real gem It was a wonderful experience the Team is doing a really great job We will definitely be back  its one of the best restaurants in EdinburghWas walking past and decided to drop in The food was good but not great A reasonable meal for the price Unfortunately the service was very slowAwesome Indian food in Edinburgh We wanted something other than bread and pub food and were happy to find this place in a nice area by the medical school Delicious naan and great currieSI went here while reuniting with a group of friends I met originally in Nepal and this was a wonderful place for dinner I know most folks visiting Edinburgh will likely be more interested in trying Haggis for the first time or going on a whiskey tasting adventure make sure you try some Lagavulin but once youve done all of that you should really have dinner here at Namaste KathmanduThe Momos were delicious as were the Mango Lassi but the main courses were the real treat I dont specifically remember all of the dishes we enjoyed they were all vegetarian but I can tell you we have a number of them and ate family style always the best way to go because you get to enjoy much more than a single menu itemSo if you find yourself touring through Scotland or if youre fortunate enough to call the beautiful city of Edinburgh home then this is definitely a worthwhile place to eatVery good food mixed IndianNepalese Decently priced Service a bit chaotic but very friendly waiters Worth it"

    "review":"Fishers in the City let us down the last time we had a family dinner there So this time we took our mother shes 78 you know to the original and vastly superior Fishers Bistro down at The Shore in Leith to celebrate her birthday We began with a cocktail or two sitting outside Malmasion depuis 1994 enjoying the sights upmarket hen weekenders the sounds ditto and the smells sea champagne perfume and a soupon of sewerage Then it was a short stroll to Fishers Bistro where the smells significantly improved Our meal: The oysters were reported as exemplorary and came with a little bottle of Tabasco a side dish of chopped onion and paprika There was a striking dish of mussels and clams and an almost delicious dish of swordfish strips with pickled ginger bean sprouts and sesame The latter came wrapped in a bogstandard wheat tortilla without which the plate would have been near perfect Then followed whole plaice panfried cod and queenie scallops  all of which were superb if the grunting noises were anything to go by I can personally vouch for the plaice cooked perfectly with a small topping of goats cheese just enough to compliment not swamp the delicacy of the fish A substantial side dish of mange tout gratin dauphinoise and carrots accompanied the lot in a retro yet surprisingly appropriate mannerPuddings We all had one Which either means the portions are of a reasonable size or we are greedy pigs Stalwarts such as sticky toffee pudding chocolate mud pie and pecan pie all came served with ice cream or cream We didnt have coffee and by then they needed the table back for the second sitting a harsh intrusion of commercial reality into our wellfed heaven The wine list was reasonable in as much as as I only perused the white ones We enjoyed a very decent Pouilly Fume at 2250 two actually rejected the two Cloudy Bay options at 32 and could have settled for several other perfectly good New and Old World whites between 15  30The cold seafood plate was really delicious The fish cakes we did not enough The mussels were a bit disappointing and the raw oysters were amazingGreat seafood place A perfect alternative to the local favourite and much pricier ship on the shore Humble welcoming atmosphere with a seaside Scottish feel Small place so reserve in advance Staff were very friendly Oysters were fantastic seafood was fresh and prepared well Theres a limited vegetarian menu for those who arent into seafoodbut Id recommend just not going to a seafood restaurant in that caseI am not sure if we have been very lucky or if Scotland became a gourmet country Either one we are very happy with the restaurants we have been trying for the last 2 weeks Of course having advices from Yelpers helps a lot because guided us for the best ones Fishers is just across the street from our hotel and we could not resist the lovely food smell passing their everyday Good Friday seemed the perfect opportunity to try it The food was delicious with a hint of surprise and very fresh And the fact that the restaurant is across from the ocean adds another special touch Without a reservation at Good Friday lunch time they managed to find us a table near the window We order the white house wine which was from France priced at 1590 the bottle Nice and crisp Sauvignon Blanc went very well with our food My husband asked for the squid fried with a delicious pepper jelly sauce And I started with the pumpkin and coconut soup of the day perfectly seasoned with a hint of pepper Scored very highly already Following my new tendency to have a start as a main course again I had the fish cakes and again I just loved them My husband had the well elaborated coley on coconut sauce and wonderful rice plate We share the creme bulle and finished the day with a very tasty and classically present house Port The bill ended up as 5555 and worth every penny What a wonderful experienceWir hatten Glck Es war Samstag halb sechs und die Frage ob uns 2 h reichen bejahten wir So konnten wir ohne Reservierung hier tafeln Ich habe mir eine Seafood Platter fr 19  bestellt die superlecker und echt ihr Geld wert war 1xQuerbeet durch die Nordsee frisch auf den Tisch Sehr empfehlenswert Barsch mit Kartoffeln war fr 12  zu haben ein schmackhafter Forellensalat fr 650 Fr ein Restaurant dass laut Sunday Times zu den besten 100 in UK gehrt sind die Preise sehr bodenstndig Ich wei jedenfalls wo ich bei meinem nchsten Besuch in Schottlands Hauptstadt sicher wieder einkehren werde Visiting Scotland for the first time and wanted to try the fresh seafood This place delivers The wait staff was excellent and gave us pointers on places to visit and recommendations for local breakfast The food was superb  Each of our group had a different seafood dish and were totally impressed We did save room for a wonderful sticky toffee pudding delightful Would highly recommend"

    "review":"Although this place is adorable and the long list of specials indeed special I dont think you should offer food that doesnt play to your strong suits and thus I cant recommend this place Their specials were all over the place from a seabass salad to steak Should have stuck with the italian theme and ordered ravioli I ordered a chili bean dish which ended up being a sad pass as a burrito complete with salsa with no flavor and creme fraiche instead of sour cream Come on Google Mexican and get it right man My sisters pulled pork sandwich was awesome but even on her plate there was some disappointment like the potato chips that were cut too thick I will say the chocolate Nutella peanut butter cake was nice but when I ordered a flat white I was served a latte Ugh Give it a missHad a very disappointing brunch here recently We had booked a table for 4 in advance explicitly stating we wanted brunch Upon arrival we were given a table and after a lengthy amount of time looking at the menus were eventually given some water for the table After having decided what we wanted and having to get the waitresses attention numerous times it was time to make our order However it was not to be Despite having only opened an hour beforehand the breakfast menu was depleted with over half of the options listed being  unavailable Their excuse of being busy due to the fringe was disappointing the whole city is busy for the fringe I dont see any other restaurants completely run out of food We settle for some breakfast sandwiches consisting of seemingly the last remnants of sausage egg and bacon in the place some french toast and salmon with scrambled eggs or so I thought After a while of waiting our food arrives its ok Something I could have easily rustled up at home in about half the time to be honest However Im given French Toast when I explicitly ordered salmon and told by my rather rude waitress that this is what I ordered and when I told her otherwise she informed me that there was no salmon left and briskly walked offI wont be returning to this restaurant the food was mediocre at best the availability of options was quite frankly pathetic and the service was atrociousWe were in Edinburgh visiting friends and came to the Roamin Nose for dinner on the Saturday night For a starter I had a three pesto dip combination with different slices of bread I didnt use all the pesto but the owner recommended that we keep them on the table for the main courses which was an inspired idea I cant remember all of the components of my main course but I cleared the plate and ate all of the salad much to Julia Ds surprise I was too full for dessert but all four of us shared a mint chocolate cake From where I sat I could see into the kitchen as they made a different array of pasta dishesThe entire bill for four with wine came and a tip to 100 which was money well spent the equivalent place in London would have charged a lot more I recommend and would definitely come back next time Im north of the borderA friend took me here for breakfast on a Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised by how cosy and nice it was The caf itself is very quaint and sort of rustic with welldrawn portraits of Bill Murray on the walls The staff was really lovely and wed made a reservation so we go a nice seat by the window It is not to far from Stockbridge and it was a was fairly busy so it was good wed planned aheadThe breakfast menu isnt too extensive but everything looked really good as they offer eggs bacon and sausage options with toast they have French toast salmon and cream cheese with toast or either a meatfilled or fullvegetarian breakfast for 890 We opted for the full veggie breakfast and each had a coffee The coffee was wellmade and tasted good although I think they use a preground coffee or some sort of Italian bean as it wasnt super distinctive in flavour but thats me being a coffee snob It was complete fine and warm and tastyThe breakfast arrived in good time and it was delicious There was toast one egg cooked either scrambled poached or fried veggie haggis two veggie sausages grilled mushrooms and baked beans It was a very generous portion and everything was so good especially the vegetarian haggis I could have eaten just that It had walnuts and split peas in it I think and it was absolutely amazing If anything they get me as a fan for that It is a worthwhile stop for a wellpriced breakfast I got the pricier option but most of the breakfast options come in between 57 On the weekend they dont serve lunch until one but they had some tasty looking breakfastish type sandwiches that sounds good so I will definitely have to be back for lunchMy friends Meredith and Andy live nearby and took me here on my visit I had a delicious cauliflower and cheese soup It was seriously a flavorful and healthy tasting soup It came with a spoonful of cheese that you could add to the soup Matt B got a three dip combo that was pesto red pepper and olive It came with nice slices of white breadMy main was a warm salad with greens quinoa goat cheese beets and sweet potatoes Id never had a warm salad like that Very unique The owner was a super friendly and and made us feel like she was hosting us in her house We got mint chocolate cake for dessert The cake was a little dry but the frosting was delicious I wish I lived closerI really love the Roamin Nose  granted Ive only been here for breakfast but the breakfast menu is brilliant and really cheap especially compared to others in the area  My husband ordered the full breakfast which was really a good size for the price and my scrambled eggs are always divine with chunky toast  Whenever Ive been in  and its been a number of times Ive always ordered the same thing cause i cant fault it but the staff are always really helpful although ok sometimes they have been a little slow but thats the only fault i can pick up here  The breakfast menu at least has brilliant choices they are always happy to accomodate young children and they even have books for them at the sofas in the front window which is a nice touchI love this cafe Ive yet to go on a Sunday afternoon when they have live music but i will be popping down soon  Not too cramped plenty of room great menu and especially compared to other cafes in the area the prices are really goodKind of quirky  you must check out the Bill Murray portraits for sale all over the place i dont know the artist but they must really love bill murray brilliant  Personally I love the Roamin Nose the menu is fab the location and decor the food is always perfect and the price is excellent "

    "review":"Oh great just what Edinburgh needs another humusfalafelshawarma takeaway place Not And just to be a little bit different they also offer pizzas and kebabs too Oh no waitIts only just opened so as I was walking past on my way home the other day I thought Id try it out It was lunchtime I knew I had nothing in the fridge and I have to be honest I do have a cheeky weakness for a humus and falafel wrapBut I dont really know what to say about this place that hasnt already been said already about every other one of the hundreds of places like this in the city centre My wrap was nice enough they have cheaplooking tables and chairs for you to sit at if you want to all the ingredients were in those metal bowls that they all seem to use and there was one of the revolting meat things rotating in front of a heatlamp for the doner kebab munchers out there But not exactly anything that couldnt be said about anyones local kebab shop anywhere in the UKIm not sure if this will last Its one saving grace might be the fact that Pizza Paradise a few doors along is so disgusting that people may defect here rather than enduring Pizza Paradise simply due to the lack of other options And if thats the case it can be no bad thingThis is another average Kebab joint It seems to be making a bit of an effort to shake off the grease laden scummy image that many Kebabbies have but that is a tough task There is a seating area that wouldnt be out of place in a standard Maccy Ds and that seems to be the type of client they appeal to The food is pretty average It is not smeared in grease and could possibly be actual meat instead of squished plastic but to be honest it is pretty bland and unadventurous I know most people arent looking for an adventure when they go for a kebab but something different would have been nice Ironically by cleaning up the image of a skanky kebab shop they have also lost a bit of the character Go here if the only other place open is the godawful Pizza Paradise down the road though youd probably have more fun thereArguably there are enough MiddleEastern takeaways on Nicholson Street to feed the entire city  However just for good measure Zenobia has set up camp  It looks a bit more lush than the others from the outside with a stark black and gold sign to attract the customers  The guys inside are friendly and seem to make everyone feel welcomeThe menu has just about everything which you would expect from the place in the way of kebabs falafels and the classic pizzas  I went for their doner with salad mayonnaise and chips  The meat was fairly greasy and Ive certainly tasted better in the area but the salad was fresh and the chips werent badMy mate had a pizza which looked okay although there seemed to be a bit of grease on the top  Id come here again as it actually has quite a nice ambiance but Ill be expecting a bit more from the foodZenobia has set itself apart from other takeaways in this area by offering more seating more variety healthier food and a family friendly environmentIts halfway between takeaway and cafe reminding me more of the latter with its sleek appearance and impressive seating area They serve up a variety of foods  a lot of which you see in takeaways yes But kebabs and pizzas arent a slapdash effort in Zenobia with the quality of their kebabs suggesting it was fresher than the likes of stuff that sits under a heatlamp or steeped in grease for hoursZenobia marks the beginning of South Bridge which admittedly is not the kind of area where youll be seen puttin on the Ritz So when I was hungry one lunchtime I had to step over the sick in the street to get to my food destination  a bit of an appetite killer Sadly its the area that needs cleaned up but at least its not an overall reflection on the better more respectable businesses like Zenobia which reside in itAverage Kebab place I got a Chicken Shawarma here and it was OK The service is quick and its pretty close to the old city so its great to take care of a quick craving and nothing elseOh and they have a pretty good Hummous hereWell what to say about ZenobiaI used to be a big fan I would have recommended them to anybody Then I went in on a Friday night Saturday morning at 2:45 am after wrapping up a nice night of clubbing I dont expect pristine service at 2:45 am but nobody in my group of 4 was either belligerent or rude We were very friendly and happy to be in Zenobia One member of my party actually ordered 2 kebabs for himself and his girlfriend at home So 4 of us purchased 5 kebabs The man was friendly when selling to us then when we finished our purchases I asked for the toilet and he said they had no toilet oddThen at 2:50 he said in 10 minutes we close  at 2:55 because I check my watch constantly I knew precisely the time he gave us he kicked us out He was very rude and there were about 7 other diners with usall given the boot I understand kicking out the drunks at closing time but I was with a group of three along with a group of 5 and we were all given the boot 5 minutes before closing I appreciate Zenobias five  mixed kebabs which are not cheap but I protest the horrendous service I was regular customer but now I will definitely be going elsewhere for my kebab needsAs to the healthy food mentioend by Marj C on 1972010: I was never asked what sauce or sides I would like with my kebab I do not want sauce and was never given the option Omitting sauce by default is not the same as offering healthy options but rather it is simply omitting the OPTION of health"

    "review":"It always starts you off well when you say buona sera to an Italian waiter in an Italian restaurant and then order a good bottle of Barbera dAlba  From that moment on we had impeccable service even on a busy Saturday evening  The place was full with a good background roar of conversation but not so loud that you had to shout at your partner  We ordered salad and seafood as starters and different pasta dishes as mains  It was all good  Nothing to complain about but I dont think it merited the five stars being awarded by other YelpersWe found this restaurant on our first trip to Scotland and LOVE it  Foods is awesome great service and extremely friendly waiterswaitresses  If we are in Edinburgh for 4 nights well eat at La Piazza at least twice if not moreThis was a pretty good Italian spot near where we were staying on New Town in Edinburgh  I ordered one their pizzas and my wife got the pasta with mussels  Food was fresh and service was friendly  I ended up only eating 23 of my pizza so the leftovers made for a nice breakfast the next morningWent here again last week and it was as good as ever Excellent carbornara and decent wine list Away from the touristy area alsoWandering around Edinburgh all day my parents and I were hungry for some pizza We were staying near Princes Street so I was happy to see a wellreviewed place that served pizza right nearby We showed up at an off time like 2:30 on a Monday but La Piazza was still open for business The waiter we had was super friendly and welcoming alsoNow I am from New York City so I am a bit of a pizza snob and this was my first slice of pizza in Edinburgh so I didnt know what to expect Well I was pleasantly surprised We each ordered a rocket salad which was yummy and two pizzas to split between the three of us which was the perfect amount of food We all really enjoyed the Piccante pizza which had peppers pepperoni and chili on it The chili was a great addition as in the US we are not used to having that as a topping We also ordered the margarita pizza which while good was really just a cheese pizza with a sprig of basil on it and not a margarita pizza Anyway I will definitely return to this place if I am in the area it is perfect for one of my favorite goto meals of salad and pizza with beer and if no one is there to share the pizza with me I will just box the other half to go or probably eat it all myselfIts been a while crocodileIt has been a good few years since Ive popped in here its just due to my BFF moving offices further awayMy boy had book group so I usually meet with him before for dinner and go along with him to the book group so tonights dinner choice was hereFirst off the staff are all friendly Really welcoming  I was seated at the window but wished it was a wall because it was chilly Other than that the whole experience was fineWe shared a cold meat board which consisted of mortadella my fav salamis parma ham and really nice chicken liver pate and warmed bruscettaWe both ordered pizza  mine being chicken and mushen with an extra of rosemary and the boys being anchovies and capers with an extra of salami  The pizzas are really tasty and have a lovely thin base  just the way pizzas should be  I had a glass of red wine with my meal which was super niceDefo would recommend if you are in the area for lunch or dinner"

    "review":"Piatto Verde is great cheap and cheerful traditional Italian banter in an unpretentious atmosphere ideal in my opinion if theres a big gang of you wanting to go on a night out but you want to pretend to be at least a little bit civilised at the beginning Theres nothing better than a good dose of pizza or pasta to line your stomach before an alcohol endurance marathon ie an average night out in Scotland and youve got a chance of making it until 3am if you take the time to eat beforehandI came here with a big group of friends before what was inevitably going to turn into a rum catalysed dance session or embarrassment and we got big amounts of house wine and a starter and main for much less than any of the city centre Italians Piatto Verde is near the  Fountain Park complex so slightly more out of the way but really only a short walk from the west end and its worth it for the cash savings The pasta dish I went for was really tasty and generously proportioned The restaurant space is definitely cosy though so youll need to book ahead if youre planning on pitching up with a big groupI was so close into giving this place a 5stars review after my first visit: arrived early table for two red wine in a carafe friendly waitress extremely tasty food great ambience like a little Italian place popped out from an old movie kindofthing and with a LEGENDARY profiterole for farewell And after a few days from that great night I was looking for good food around 20:15 It is a small place neighbourhood style so I imagined it wont stay late open during the week So I asked what time do they stop serving The waitress kindly confirmed to us with the ownerchef that last orders are at 20:30 so I reply well be back in 510 minutes please dont close while smiling : We returned back less than 10 minutes later however the ownerchef this time replied through the waitress that the kitchen had been cleaned up and they only take orders for pizza Really I mean REALLY I did prefer the takeaway so we ordered a calzone pizza which to his credit was good but it felt a bit disappointing I will certainly think twice before going there againI lived near Piatto Verde when they first openedWe revisited this weekend as part of a trip down memory laneIt is exactly the same The chef the decor the atmosphere the tiramisuThe only criticism I have is the heavy handedness with the chilli: I had lost feeling in my lips by the time I finished my aglio y olioWorth a visitDid I just find my goto Italian joint Oh boy oh boy I think that I didIve walked past Piatto Verde at least a half a million times before If you live in the area its easy to bypass the rows of kebab shops and small ambiguous food joints as meh One night in particular we walked past PV peered inside and said Nah Its so smallLucky for me I didnt let that stop me in the end With some friends in tow and a reservation booked in advance you definitely want to do this on evenings because did I mention how wee it is we marched in and were promptly seated PV itself is cozy and shabby in the sort of mismatched cozy rather charming way only a place that doesnt take itself too seriously can accomplish It has about four maybe five tables tops but one of them could seat quite a few so if you have a group you could perhaps squeeze 8 or so inside there were also some chillens runnin round so theres thatAfter being seated we perused the surprisingly extensive menuany place that has more than one standard vegetarian main to try totally gets points in my book and my other half and I were hard pressed to choose just which one we wanted to try A fairly priced and solid carafe of house red wine was purchased starters and mains were ordered and the rest is history Our server was around just enough to be thorough just friendly enough to seem genuine and also hollered in Italian to her buddies in the back several times something that I think added to the authenticity of the place And the FOOD If youre expecting something incredofancy this is not your joint But if you want the kind of creamy Italian goodness you cant quite ever manage to cook for yourself this is your guy I had a mushroom tortelloni main and I promptly devoured it My husbands calzone was enormous Not only that but our startersolives for our friends and for us mixed platters of mozzarella and tomatoes and the likewere simple and lovely But I think what really sealed the deal for me was as another Yelper has mentioned the profiteroles I made the mistake of ordering the perfectly adequate tiramisu whereas my husband got the profiterole After one bite I was hulking out with envy he was nice enough to trade me one for some tiramisu or I would have thrown myself on the ground and had a profiteroleless tantrum DAMN were those things delicious Ive never actually had a profiterole before but I reckon these would be tough boots to fill in the futureSummary: a lovely joint if youre looking for a casual delicious evening or lunch meal at a surprisingly reasonable price Im absolutely going to return in the future And youll probably see me stuffing my gob with profiterolesIts a little bit out of the way and has an exterior that doesnt entirely inspire confidence but Piatto Verde sits alongside Domenicos on the podium of the finest Italian restaurants in Edinburgh The service is superb and the dishes are high quality The simple message is: GO and go soonOverall we said: The only real problem I see with this place is that it is not nearer to where I live though the next time I am in need of a good Italian fix and find myself on this side of town instead of near Domenicos Ill go here no questionPiatto Verde is without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in townIts a tiny little place tucked away on the edge of Fountain Bridge that really doesnt look much from the outside In fact I had walked past it many many times before I even realised it was thereThe inside is small and cosy with only half a dozen tables or so The decor is not too fancy but just enough that it seems very authentic and has a lot of heart You know immediately that youre not in some sterile chain restaurantThere appears to only be one fulltime chef Massimo who must perform miracles to cook all the dishes to order by himself and one full time waitress a lady who is more Italian than Silvio Berlusconi and will greet you in loud bursts of flamboyant halfItalian halfEnglish The ambiance created by these two characters loudly calling to each other in their native ways is truly charmingSit yourself down order a carafe of the very fairly priced and dangerously drinkable house plonk and soak it all inThe menu in Piatto Verde covers a very good selection of different pastas risottos and pizzas as well as some great antipasti There are plenty of those classic Italian meats but also a very good selection of veggie options Everything is made to order so customisations are an option if you want a tweak on somethingTheir pasta dishes are absolutely divine Their sauces are rich and flavourful and the ingredients always taste absolutely fresh and topnotch In Piatto Verde you very much get the sense that youre dealing with a chef who absolutely knows what hes doing when it comes to handling Italian flavours and combinationsThe pizzas are amazingly good too Normally I dont expect much from restaurants that do pizzas as a sideline rather than a focus but Piatto Verde could be running a pizzeria alone such is the tastiness of their circular delights Try the calzones too Theyre outstandingFinally do yourself a favour and get the god damn profiteroles Just do it Your life will never be the same afterwardsThis restaurant really has it all: absolutely fantastic authentic food really great service a broad and well thoughtout menu very reasonable prices and Italian charm by the bucketload Book ahead"

    "review":"In traditional Stephanie style I am giving this place five stars because this shit is on DUKE STREET Admittedly I am a new Leither Im not sure I am even a Leither being that I live in Craigentinney next Yelp goal is to review all the places here But I have been known to scuttle my way to Duke Street when I need: A: Wetherspoons breakfast for under 3B: Discount books because on Duke Street ALL the good books are still on the shelves at the charity shop C: Tesco But never never have I been known to go to Duke St for a really nice meal In a terrifying turn of events in my life my boyfriends mother is moving to the UK She was roaming around England looking for massive Tudor mansions I imagine I have no idea when she decided to come up and visit her son for a few nights I happen to live with her son So she happened to be sleeping on my couch for the weekend We decided that The Lioness had gotten reviews that were acceptable to bring a massively picky English lady my words not his We were SO right For less than 10 each not Wetherspoons prices but what is we had a fantastic fantastic meal I ordered the fish she ordered some sausages and he got some game bird but really it was so difficult to decide I wanted a plate of all of it We had amazingly delicious cocktails and fancy free water free water is key  And it was good Not take away chips and curry good Not burgers at Holyrood 9A good it was like fancy restaurant on George St good and it was on Duke Street Until Duke St is lined with high end restaurants that I can bring my boyfriends slightly terrifying mother to LOL  youre five stars in my bookOh Lioness I so want to like you but your kitchen keeps letting the side down The frontend service is very friendly a few minor glitches with the orders but largely attentive and kindly The food just never quite gets off the ground My chicken burger was tepid on arrival and leathery but the rosemary fries were quite good My dessert was a brownie with ice cream that was a microwavedthenhardened lump Not terribly chocolatey either My husband had a veggie burger that was a jumbled pile of veg on a roll Meh Dad and teen had the fish and chips which were paltry portions and only soso Mum had aubergine with some sort of ratatouille but found it uninteresting and small I give the Lioness points for now having a childrens menu and toys colouring in for the kids The beer was lovely but the food is not where it should be at these prices And Ill allcap this last part: THE PORTIONS ARE TOO SMALLDaura Damm GF beer available and for a first visit this pleased me a lotI dont find myself in Leith that often and although weve had a few brunches in Leith Ive always found the menus to be lacking in GF friendliness so Ive tended to avoidThe Lioness is one of the new gang of pubs which have opened over the last year or so All reclaimed furniture lots of wood and even a pinball machine you can sit at We of course sat at the pinball machine for novelty value but not the most comfortable as I hate sitting on stoolsSo GF beer available  yay We grabbed some quick snacks  chips which were ok and nothing outstanding hence the three stars If Im in the area then I probably would pop back and try some more of the menu as there were GF friendly dishes listed and maybe will increase the star ratingThey have just opened to the public and got their license a day before that Thus they are still trying hard to get the correct system in place  Some of the beers were not on yetand some of the wine hadnt arrived That said they are a very friendly and helpful bunch The staff is lovely and sweet The atmosphere is a pub a brownish one The decorations are a well though out mismatch of grafittied walls to taxidermied exotic animals We noticed that there are a few elements not so well though out The lack of coat hooks for one This means people use the sofas or the back of chairs to leave their coat and discovering the second flaw  balance The chairs are not designed to have a heavy coat on them so they tend to topple over Minor but noticable inconvenience I think they need to change the seats supply pillows but that could just be me The good points are the staff prices for the food cocktails and other drinks Also the menu is slightly different than the usual fares you get I loved their chefs handrolled sausage and vodka infused fennel And the rosemary roasties were a treat It was nice of one of the chefs and owner Joseph Malik to come out and have a little chat with us and plug their brunch menu as well And that looks delicious  I do like it here and have already staked my favourite seats in the houseThis place is exactly what duke street was crying out for Good atmosphere with lively decoration It doesnt conform to one theme but pinball arcade machine and getto blasters take you back to the 80s Some might call it hipster Take a closer look and you will find that theyve maintained much of the original quirks of what is an interesting building Tastefully botched up floorboards give it a genuine feel and reclaimed furniture works to good effectThe lioness lager is nice and I was happy to discover that its reasonably priced This is what Ive stuck to each time Ive been The only criticism I can make is the price of the menu which put us off ordering anything But on the flip side if they did cheaper grub then maybe the place would become too popularOverall thumbs up Another jewel in Leiths majestic crownI only popped in here for a quick drink to kill some time before picking the boy up from Tai Kwon Do I wasnt expecting much as the foot of Leith Walk can sometimes be dodgyHowever I had a pleasant surprise A wee gem of a place and right across from Tesco near to Leith Links its a pretty good location for the locals and anyone else about in Leith really I only had a GT but I thought the price was pretty decent at 350 Saying that I think it was tonic from the tap But even so I didnt eat there but from the looks of things they had a pretty nice menu The table next to me had giant bowls of mussels which made me and big seafood scaredy cat tempted to go back and try them There were a number of people in having meals The atmosphere itself was really laid back and chilled It was only 6:30 when I popped in but they were pretty busy and no one minded if you were on your own with a few grocery bags even The bar maid that served me was lovely and friendly It looks like they took reservations as well and could easily host events parties whatever I would recommend it if youre in the area and looking for a nice place to get some drinks Its a bit out of the way if youre heading into town but if youre heading down to the shore or doing a Leith pub crawl definitely put this one on your list of stops"

    "review":"What can I say After all the promotion and build up I was really looking forward to this place but what a major disappointment Table booked for 8 not seated until half past No service until 9 no food until half 9 Poor service tiny portions over priced Look beyond the adidas uniforms and hipster charm The place looks cool but dont believe the hype its not worth itI had a voucher deal for two naanwiches and two craft beers or lassis so I came for lunch with the lovely Anita A We both chose the pulled pork vindaloo and it was the spiciest sandwich Ive ever had in my life It was packed with whole peppercorns and chillies too It was so uncomfortable with my nose running and mouth on fire and I was even sweating that we had to get yogurt to beat the fire Tone down the spice so its enjoyable V DeepI want to like this place Its on my doorstep and as I like the concept it has a good impression written all over it But sadly it hasnt lived up to my expectations Biggest gripe is the prices v portion Too expensive What we got was tapas for the price of a decent starter This meant that for a party of 6 including small bowls of rice and naans Drinks and water we paid around 20 Each Second gripe is spice heat experience There was none It was explained by the waitress that the spice level is authentic The vindaloo is possibility the biggest let down Gripe 3: music This was loud louder than youd want for a sharing and convo experience So in all I will have to mark it down and probably wont make a return visitBit of a mixed bag this one In truth I was never really a fan of the Vintage just another bar the hipsters told us was cool in my opinion so I held no grudges ahead of my visit to VDeep I and few friends have a curry club  VDeep does curry No brainerI like what theyve done with the place Not what I expected at all very pop art and graffitiinspired I particularly liked the design of the tables with their comic book pages or their layers of seeds and spices beneath panes of PlexiglasMenus interesting but pretty small with the shellfish and the staff curry the only dishes changing daily to add further variety In truth there were four of us we ordered two dishes each and in doing so tried everything on the menu that piqued our interest If repeat visits were to be had it would have to be down to the quality of the food and not the food we didnt get to tasteThe Highs: Haggis Pakora on Tamarind Sauce Mutton Achari Butter Chicken Kerelan Rainbow Trout Bhuna Beef the highlight Good staff laid back but knowledgeable and forwardthinking Case in point: when we arrived the waitress advised that they were out of Coconut Pork Pakora and also the Pork Cheek Vindaloo Two dishes I had earmarked ahead of our visit Gutted The latter had been replaced by a pork belly dish so I instead ordered that however when the dishes came the girl advised that thet in fact DID have pork cheeks and so she ordered that for me instead some might find that presumptuous but I made a show of my disappointment so on this occasion it was a great callThe Lows: The Pork Cheek Vindaloo was star aniseheavy and as a result not very nice sad face It also burnt the roof of my mouth off I like a hot curry but I dont expect it to do that to me Venison Korma meatballs were tough and dry and the sauce was too thick to mop up with the naans The naans were overcooked dry and brittle All dishes seemed to be 1  150 too expensive Ive no idea how successful these guys are on the weekends but Tuesday night saw three tables of 46 people If theyre struggling in any way they might want to revise their pricing structureThe Middles: Kohli Fried Chicken was middle of the road and also a bit dry The Bubble  Sikh was nice verging on unremarkableOverall like I say its a bit middle of the road Unlike the other reviewers I would say the dishes had flavour with the Venison  and the Fried Chicken the only bland exceptions Unfortunately for me not all of them were good flavoursThe Bhuna Beef and the Rainbow Trout are musthaves on a menu of predominantly average dishes Worth a look if you havent been before but I doubt Id be back for my curry fixLoads of hype sadly not met at all An initial sense of excitement quickly dissipated into rapid disappointmentEvery dish was bland tasteless nowhere near as good as menu made them sound On the chicken legs KFC on the menu was dry coconut flakes somehow made green and having NO flavour  TWO members of staff confirmed to me that that was the promised chutney That is not a chutney Dry dry dry Caulifower cheese did not contain cheese just milk and cauliflower and not nuch of it The naan was basically a massive bit of bread toasted to hell on the top raw in the middle and cold on the bottom Not like any naan Ive ever had before Its only redeeming feature was the butter swimming around the groove on top of it  everything else dipped into said pool was enhanced by it But you couldnt eat the naanThe service was dreadful  person in charge sat at bar with an ipad Waiter on first shift had no info and no assistance from manager at all I was obviously dissatisfied and no effort was made at all to find out why or compensate To offer no personality in a place so colourful is quite an acheivementThe wine was goodWorst of all  I had 2 extremely small dishes and a rubbish naan on my bill with a glass of wine 3890 for a person alone in a tapas place Total ripoff I wont be back and I dont think Im alone If only the chef tasted things he sent out and realised flavour was missingbig fat shame all roundIm really surprised that this hasnt had more reviews by now TLDR  lovely food but small portions for 675  Ive a good appetite so sometimes its me just being Forever Hungry but Ive read a few reviews put that as their onlymain criticismAbout a month ago I read on Twitter they were going to be doing a Vegan Night then after a couple of weeks of not hearing anything  and having kept the date free and being a bit concerned I wouldnt be able to rally a group of available vegan friends to come with me for a meetup  I got in touch with them and it was still going ahead and I had a great chat with them about possible menu optionsAt three days notice of the event being announced publicly with no menu and no price guide yet available I was glad to entice 6 did someone say vegan naan vegans to come along for dinner with me to try out their Vegan Day  The restaurant devised a completely vegan menu locked away all their nonvegan foods so the kitchen was completely meatdairyegg crosscontamination free and I was delighted to see the restaurant really busy when I arrived  There was also a list prepared of veganfriendly beers and winesThere was a good range of sides including apple chutney coconut rice chapatti and a specially made egg and dairy free naan It was massive  It was priced at 350 and definitely big enough to share and I love naan almost as much as I love chips so thats saying a lot from me  I dont like that way a naan often gets as it cools and goes crispy so next time to keep it doughy for as long as possible Im going see if I can ask for it medium rare hahaOn recommendation from the manager I opted for the creamy stuffed aubergine  which were delicious  and the chill tofu fry which I also loved  I also tried the onion pakode like pakora chickpea massala the veggie haggis samosas and the coconut rice  There were several mains which I didnt try eg a potato curry and I think there was a cauliflower dish tooI was very very impressed with the selection of dishes the quick turnaround time it appears to have taken to put everything together and that someone just got the idea of trying out a vegan event and running with it and seeing how it went  It is far far more than most other restaurants do though I am pleased each day with the more labelledadvertised vegan options places are providing  My only qualm was the size of portions but it is clear from their website that their mains are sharing plates and this sizeprice structure is their set style  I would definitely go back but be filling up on carbs wiith the rice and naan  This my technique in Japanese places when sushi just doesnt cut it for my appetite and I need noodlesThe dessert well it was originally going to be a jalabi a deep fried floury pretzel with coconut sorbet but I believe the sorbet was pulled at the last minute because of a query on a nonvegan ingredient  Fair enough  Instead the jalabi came on top of a ramekin of rhubarb  Opinions in our group were mixed  I am not a big fan of rhubarb and for me it was a bit more tart than what I would like from a dessert  If it had been a giant jalabi with a rhubarb glaze or jalabi doughnuts with a rhubarb dip I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more  However others really enjoyed itI also liked the music grooves they had on when I arrived though it seemed to dip in pace and volume by the time we leftI am guessing there was a bit of experimenting to come up with things not normally on the menu and to make a full menu of vegan dishes when some places will just whip out a fruit salad and some tomato pasta if youre lucky is really going the extra mile  My worry with specific vegan nights in particular is whether they can sustain but they have regular vegan customers anyway so to have a night where there are so many more options would be worth diarising  The next one is 29th June I hope to make itPS  Great handdrier :  A velocity rather than a Dyson this time"

    "review":"Stopped in and had a nice board of Charcuterie Had pate 2 types of dried sausagesprosciutto olives pickles and mustard This place lets dogs in tooits cool seeing a dog while youre eating Very goodDelicious Scottish breakfast juice and cappuccino were also really good Lovely surroundings Cant fault itWe arrived early for our seats at the Kitchin and stopped on in here for a quick glass of wine We had wished we had found this place earlier  The interior was extremely comfortable and they had a fantastic selection of European wines They also had a very quaint outside overlooking the river  The staff was helpfully to assist us in picking our wines since we are from the states and not versed in the region based naming of their wines I noticed they had a selection of foods and desserts but did not consider them since we were about to go to dinner next  I wished I had more time in Edinburgh because I would have liked to ate here so if I am lucky and get to visit Scotland again I will definitely stop on inOur visit wasnt planned but I feel lucky that we ended up at the Caf for our lunch on Sunday  What a lovely place the atmosphere was great as was the food  I think the menu was varied and good value for money and not overly expensive  I was planning my next visit before I have even completed my meal  I totally love that dogs are also welcomed  now thats what I call family friendlyWenr there shortly after they opened  Wasnt too impressed and good wasnt memorableThis is a great place for Sunday breakfast and even a Scottish breakfast and the atmosphere is mellow so you can bring your kids or dogs or even both That being said you will have to endorse kids screening wile you are trying to enjoy your breakfast The crpes are great for breakfast or dinner I have had breakfast lunch and dinner here and the food has been great I had ribeye stake and it was cooked perfectly however the chips were soggy and cold by the time I got to them The frustration of having a great steak with soggy chips that were cold when I got them was a little frustrating The chips are easy to get right and even easier to get wrong by cooking them to early and having them sit on the hot line I had a salad  with red onions and oil There was no balance and it had so many onions I had to take 34 of them off just to finish it and there was no balance of clavier it was bitter greens no flavor they could have marinated the onions in a sweet poaching liquor to give it a complete finish If you are still reading I will say all that was just a half stare the service here is hit or miss and when its good its great but when its bad it is horrible One time I came with my boss and it took them forever to take our order because we did not arrive on time our orders did not come to the table at the same time and our waitress was missing in action and I had to get the pudding menus myself When we ordered coffee with our pudding it never came When I when got my stake my waitress was the same one from lunch and I gave her the benefit of the doubt I was left with the same service As soon as I sat down she asked me what I wanted to drink I said I would like a sparkling water and I would have to look at the menu She never told me what the specials were and wile I was reading she came back less than a minute later  yes I know it was less than a minute because I was looking at my phone after she came the second time she bent over to get close to my face because I was waiting a baseball hat so she got so close to me I was startled and I did not even want to know the specials let alone get a bottle of wine This cost them a 23 I could have ordered I just got a bottle beer to get her away from me When I was ready to order she could not understand me and I had to point to what I was ordering Then her questions started I understand English might not be her first language and I herd her speaking Polish to the cupel next to me I understand its hard to come to a country but if you get a job that you have to interact with people you must be proficient in it I can tell they do not have a numbering system because if the food is run by someone else than the one that took the order they have no idea where it goes and I even noticed when the food came to the table they did not know who gets what The is service 101 When o got my steak I didnt have time to pick up my fork and knife before Monika asked me how it was It looked great and that is all I could tell her and she turned away before I could ask her for a new napkin because mine had gotten wet I was finding up my strake and she finally can back to ask how it was when I had my mouth full How are you going to sake that then The service is where this place is lacking you cant be inconsistent and expect the best If they work on this the would be a place I would recommend but not right now when there are so many great places to go I wanted to like this but I base my ruling off all the meals And one thing that was the icing on the cake was when I was paying with my card it asked about gratuity and here is my TIP train your servers to give a great service in this industry and you have a great place till then its mediocre"

room  We managed to play ping pong for a bit while waiting for our other colleagues to arrive  It is extremely fun however the ping pong game became more of a chasing the ball game for my opponent as I was really bad in it  If you are good you will definitely enjoy it  After all the team has arrived the ping pong table doubles as a dining table for us  There are long stools for everyone to sit around the ping pong table  Most of us ordered burger  I have to say the burger was just mediocre  Not the best in Edinburgh but would definitely fill that empty stomach of yours before a big night out in thereSygn is never going to be anyones top place to go for food and drinks but its a decent solid option in the west endIf youre signed up to Itison you might have noticed that every few weeks there will be a deal for Sygn  usually burgers and cocktails for 2 for 16  This is good value for money especially given the burger usually costs 10 by itself  And these are pretty good burgers  Edinburghs best  No and they are served in a wooden tray urgh but theyre tasty and filling and you could do a lot worse  Youll be limited to a selection of around 4 cocktails to choose from but hey its so cheap does that matter too much  Ive had some good ones tooWhy only 3 stars  Because by itself Sygn really is AOK  The food is decent if a little pricey the cocktails are similarly fine  I wouldnt go out of my way to come here unless I had a voucher  But if you are looking for somewhere to grab a postwork bite to eat or catchup with a friend then have a look on Itison for a Sygn burgers and cocktails voucher and youll be satisfiedGood for a cocktail before going out for diner Nice atmosphere and helpful bar staffI booked a table via their website which was handy  I had a voucher from ITISON which gave us a great deal on 4 x burgers and cocktails for 26 instead of 60odd  They have recently redecorated the place and it looks great  I had the portabello garlic mushroom burger and fries it was delicious  I have only taken a star off as the veggie burger should have come with pesto but on enquiry their pesto has parmesan in it which isnt veggie  Everything else was fantastic and we had a really great lunch outRight dont get me wrong this is a nice place very Art Deco and chic and all that and your drinks come in big pitcher glasses saving you from going up and down to the bar after one gulp but it is very cramped and one of our party walked in and walked right back out again due to the high level of noise I guess were getting a bit old for Edinburgh nightlife loud music and standing all night squashed against some sweaty man Ill leave it to the young ones HahaServed just only slightly smaller than a clenched fist the wellproportioned pattie imparts a slight smokey char from its searing on an ultrahot grill When bit into juices begin to flow mingling with the creaminess of the homemade slaw before being soaked up by the light brioche bun Through the clearing I see hints of pink that confirm a burger cooked medium as requested Ive stumbled upon the holy grail This is how all burgers should beIf you havent already guessed Im a big fan of the burgers at Sygn Theyre right at the top of my goto list along with Bread Meats Bread on Lothian Road and the beefpork belly blended burger at Devils AdvocateIve also had very good experiences with their pizzas  super thin slightly charred bases with good quality stringy mozzarella Past menus used to feature interesting toppings such as crayfishchilli oil and pulled lamb but these have sadly been removed in favour of more generic offerings of late Hopefully on future menu changes the chef finds their pizza topping mojo againIt should be mentioned that as a bar it can get quite lively later in the evening so best to arrive pre7pm if you want a more relaxed eating experience particularly at the weekend On the flipside if you have a birthdayparty coming up and looking for a bar that does quick and crowdpleasing food  heres your guy Theres a separate room that can be hired out exactly for this purposeOut of all the cocktail bars Ive tried in Edinburgh this is the one I return to most regularly and find most consistent Reasonable too with a selection always available from 5 whatever the night of the week The menu changes fairly regularly and you can tell that thought has gone into it Many of the drinks feature their homemade syrups and garnishes so youll always find something new and unique to try A favourite of mine which seems to regularly appear on the menu is their Venice Martini Stoli vodka peach puree lemon juice  vanilla sugar Quite often with food and drink bars they pull off one to the detriment of the other but Sygn keeps both plates spinning with ease"

    "review":"Came here a few times during my few months in Edinburgh Honestly I was really excited because they advertised Taiwanese food Unfortunately I wouldnt say that this is Taiwanese foodeven the website says Orientalbut its easily the best Chinese express food place in Edinburgh Its more akin to NYstyle Chinese takeout food which many expats will know is different than UKstyle Chinese takeout food However its good for sit down just make reservations for larger parties as its fairly small I usually sat in and I usually got the beef ramen chicken with broccoli or kung po chicken when I was there The beef ramen was more like Taiwanese beef noodle soup and not Japanese ramen but this and the chicken dishes were always very deliciousabsolutely no complaints The food servings are large enough for 2 meal portions and very reasonably priced I always got matcha green tea or taro milk tea and sometimes got the tapioca bubbles Very good standard of drinksLian Pu has been a frequent visit for me whenever I have urges for some Chinese cuisine The food at reasonable prices offers a seminostalgic taste of CantonesewithanattemptofTaiwanese flavours There are surprisingly many choices on the menu albeit most are just combinations of ricetopping or noodle soupbased or wokfriedtopping The service on the other hand is quite astounding An incident with my meal today has put Lian Pu on a blacklist for any visits in the near future As usual I went with a friend for a quick lunch after classes After ordering our food noodle dish rice dish we were given a peculiar egg and shrimp dish Upon asking a staff member he hurriedly dismissed the incorrect dish and went off serving another customer A few moments later we heard the manager yellingcussing at the staff member who gave us the dish They didnt think I could understand Mandarin That dish was supposed to be made for the manager and staff to eat and because it contained expensive ingredients they took away the dish with a sorry theres something wrong with the dish remark The overall meal experience was ruined after that point Very poor serviceprofessionalism of staff members especially the manager Would only recommend for takeoutHad Chinese takeout twice and boba tapioca milk tea once The food is pretty good though their fried rice was oily and the milk tea was average I would recommend the hong shao roubraised pork belly if Im correct in translating that In general its a bit on the pricey side for casual Chinese food but I guess its understandable since there appears to be little competitioncurry food just so so Besides that i recommend to go there which is really near George square We can address our lunch problem in quick wayLian Pu is decently priced yummy Chinese Some people are fans and others are skeptical Well it is a popular place for many Chinese students and has sizeable portions at decent prices Now quality of  food is standard quality but that more greasy goodness we all need occasionally However some of their dishes can be lighter and boast some of those home comfort feels like their chicken and egg noodle soup Its also great if you want to get more traditional Chinese dishes such as beef intestine Yes they have that But if you want to get the more popular Chinese dishes they have that too Mabo tofu is really good nice and spicy yet light tofu New favorite may be the beef ho fun which is so nice for the fried noodle cravings Also they serve bubble tea The bubble tea is yummy Downstairs they have hot pot and little grills if anyone is thinking of a more all you can eat type experienceNewly opened Taiwanesestyle restaurant that serves bobabubble tea and hot foods Affordable quick and tasty  all awesome in my bookI give it a 4 stars because Im actually not 100 sure if it really is Taiwanese Firstly they serve many Cantonese dishes But more importantly Taiwanese cafe standards do not exist here  where is my Taiwanese fried chicken"

    "review":"I have to agree with Hannah on this one the owner is something else He complained when I asked him for a few pounds coins in change when I bought my Americano I sat outside and watched him sulking around the venue hating the world a little more with every step he took A small complaint from my end every table we sat at hadnt been cleaned properly I found myself battling the table just to unglue my coffee cupGreat coffee but the owner needs a hugThe first time I came in here it was to make use of the take away services that this place has  as I waited for my paninni and crepe for me and my girlfriend she lived just down the road from here I sat at a table Only to be moved quite agressivly by the owner of the cafe Now I would have understood if the place was packed and there was a bunch of old women coming in who might die if they didnt sit down but the cafe was empty bar me Still he made me stand in the corner until I had my food Hmm And now I know this seems to be a regular thing its happened to me more than once and various other stories reveal no more compasion to othersIts quite a testiment at how good this place is then that I still give it a good star rating The food is great and apart from the owner the service is good too I do recommend it  just avoid the ownerThis is a lovely little cafe in Marchmont i think thats doing it justiceI came here with a few friends and was not met by the most pleasant atmosphere We were causing problems by moving seats around there was 6 of us and the displeasure could not have been made more clear When we eventually sat down all my friends ordered bacon rolls while I went for the Minestroni Soup Bad choice It was tasteless watery and somehow rubbery whilst my friends said their bacon rolls were amazing But you cant really get them wrong rightWhen we came to pay there was a bit of trouble with splitting the bill but we managed to sort it out amongst ourselves as the waitress was being really awkward with itIt wasnt the best experience but I would go back to give it another chanceCafe Artista is an invitinglooking cafe in Marchmont which sells decent food at reasonable prices  I didnt meet or even see the owner when I was in but the food just took ages to arrive and the waitress had some beef wth me asking for a sausage and fried egg roll  Whats so difficult about just sticking an egg on whilst youre cooking the sausages  In the end I just had a sausage roll which was pretty nice and my mate had a panini which he enjoyed  The place is clean and the decor is nice enough but the service isnt really up to scratch  It was quite busy when we were in although this doesnt justify waiting almost half an hour for a roll and a panini  Cafe Artistas good food and prices are certainly not matched by their serviceWhen I sat down in Cafe Artista I thought I was in an ordinary Italian cafe It seems I was wrong  The staff at Cafe Artista seem to be in another world Its a bit like being in a sitcom The quality of drinks and snacks is good but the staff seem to be on autopilot when it comes to work I was served with barely an acknowledgment of my existence Seemingly oblivious to the customers the staff carry on their arguments or debates it was always in Italian so Im not quite sure In fact you are actually happy for the attention received if your coffee is slammed aggressively in front of you Thats your small and only part in the drama However this is all part of the fun and unique environment that coincidentally feels a lot more genuine than most cafes Its also great to sit outside on a warm summer day in a convenient location that is still a little removed from the very busiest part of the town centreRecommendedA regular haunt for pizza and occasional brunch  Proper delicious non greasy Italian pizza  Tasty pasta Nice service Good banter  Last time we went they had super tasty organic Sicilian lemonade that the waitress recommended to us  On sunny days you can sit outside  Thumbs up"

    "review":"Last time I was in Edinburgh I was curious about the restaurant as it came up as one of the top pics  We were staying nearby at the Holiday Inn Express so it was perfect to check this place out for a late lunch after we checked in  It was a cute and cozy kind of place  I loved that the natural light would brighten up the place even on a rainy day  Shortly after we ordered we got a basket of bread and butter that was really good I was tempted to try the croque madame but ended up getting the salmon  It was perfectly cooked and really loved the curry sauce to accompany it  We didnt have enough space for dessert but the pistachio cake looked amazing  Would love to come back again  maybe try the restaurant as wellCest un restaurant trs chaleureux avec une dco agrable la cuisine est originale frache et inattendue Service impeccable et rapideAn extremely disappointing visit for me and I wont be backThis is quite sad for me as this little hidden gem is really beautiful inside light and airy with tasteful decoration I was here with a few work colleagues for lunch and upon arrival bread and butter was placed on the table I asked the waiter if there was any flora or suchlike  his nostrils flared his mouth pursed as he told me with disgust that there was not Fine but when a customer has explained a lactose allergy then it would be nice to try and accommodate thatThis set the pace for the rest of the meal There was almost nothing on the menu that I could eatEveryone else dining with me seemed quite happy with their food though so if you have no weird dietary requirements then give it a bashStopped in for a quick breakfast I had the scrambled eggs with lox It was a fair amount of lox so Id say it was a good deal Sandras bacon and eggs was good she really liked the baconThe food That is why I go there  FFFFood They offer excellently crafted master pieces for a small price and this to me is their greatest attractionIt is French ish and the savoir faire is certainly there The staff is knowledgable and very friendly They go out of the way to ensure you are comfertable I was also pleasantly surprised they had a 28 Champagne on the list  which was soon on our table  avec our stewed beef and roasted quail French Fries and mayonaisseIf you want the starter as a maincourse you can always ask for a bigger portion FYIIt was a bit busy but not uncomfertably so for both guests and staff though they were on the edge but not loosing control Highly recommended but DO book a table if you are more than 2 people though when in the weekendBeen here a few times good coffee good cake and if you like your teas there is a list of about 30 to pick from Heath and Heather teabags not looseNever tried the restaurant out back only ever a coffee and friend catch up spot but very useful location for all be it escaping shopping in the James center or recovering from an up and over of a certain hill opposite :Staff are friendly enough occasionally look a little disinterested at being there but happens with the best of us Hodpodge of decor and furniture in the cafe element limited space and itll be a fight to get the front nook leather chairs but its a chilled spot and just whats needed sometimes"

    "review":"Ive seen the City Cafe hailed as Edinburghs original style bar which I think does the place a disservice as it has much more character than most of the style bars that sprung up around town in recent years The place looks vaguely like a 50s style diner complete with pool tables Theres a few booths and other seating but it tends to be standing room only when the weekend evening come around Food at the City Cafe is of good quality and served in generous portions They doe the standard burgers wraps club sandwiches along witha few more interesting options If only they had a juke box as good as Nice N Sleazy in GlasgowNever tire of the City Cafe On a recent visit I ordered the Apache Burger which came on a wooden board with a side of fat crispy floury fries Not the burger challenge by any means but still a mouthwatering repast I washed it down with a cold Guinness as I couldnt find any other ales not a criticism more an observation The decor the service and the overall feel of the place always drags me back whenever I visit Auld ReekieGood food Good price and great service Took me back to my roots with the decent bacon Definitely recommendI only just settled on 4 stars for this place Its drinks selection is pretty limitedBUTIts actually a really cool place to hang out grab some food admire the staff HAVE A SWEET MILKSHAKEI was here for a staff do on friday there and had forgotten how good the food is big chunky chips juicy burger A pretty solid shout Cant quite vouch for value for money as boss man bought the food I think its about a tenner for a burger with some chipsThe vibe is very american diner although the staff uniform isnt to type so its not over bearing as an idea The music is pretty varied and largely to my taste from what I can remember Theres a pool table Remember when bars had thoseall in all I like this place I dont find myself going to it that often but im quick to recommend it if drinks and food in town are on the cardsdefinitely worth a try :The food is good but the service is lousy They didnt help us find a seat and it took them close to ten minutes to come and greet us Not the best first impressionIt was rammed when we came for dinner though likely related to Fringe frenzy We squeezed onto some bar stools with a ledge next to them that we thought we could use as a tableWe shared a pulled pork hot dog and chips between us We decided to do this because we werent terribly hungry but it was an excellent decision as the hot dog is massive The sausages are more like sausages than frankfurters the traditional hot dog filling but that was fine and the pulled pork combined well The chips were all crisp and delicious if a bit chunkier than my idealThe toilets smelt vile"

    "review":"New Chinese buffet right next to Usher Hall Went with some friends because of the half off deal for dinner The lower rating might just be because Im not a huge fan of Chinese buffets and the food at China Red seems like typical fare for a buffet The atmosphere and interior of the restaurant is definitely a lot nicer than other Chinese buffets Ive been too but the food didnt wow me They do have a good selection of meats but only a few veggie options the green beans were pretty good Their dessert selection might even be more varied than the mains macarons ice cream jello fruit cream puffs cakes and more For a new restaurant the service was pretty good and Im sure it will improve as they work out the kinks If youre a student looking to save some money or are happy with typical Chinese buffet food then by all means give China Red a try Its nothing spectacular for me but it certainly does the job if youre craving a whole bunch of Americanstyle Chinese foodPerfect This is a hidden gem in Edinburgh I couldnt believe this is 10 I will definitely come back for sureThis is a new Chinese buffet just off Lothian Road near the Lyceum theatre and Usher Hall Situated in what was a Jimmy Chungs before the place is perfectly set up to be a Chinese buffet but theyve still done a good job in decorating the place in such a way that it feels quite cool to be in The lighting is good bright around the food serving area and dimmer where you sit to eat The place was quite loud when we were there but Im glad to see it was doing so well in its first week of openingThe food selection is great Its got every Chinese dish I could think of I always get excited at buffets and just piled my plate high with five different meats and sauces and plenty of rice and noodles as well The flavours were all very nice and the choice is good enough that you wont get bored on your second and third trips to the buffet There is also a sushi area but I dont like sushi so no comments about thatAfter dinner you can choose from a selection of cakes traybakes and ice cream for dessert all included in the buffet price All thats not included is drinks but quick and efficient staff members ensure you are not thirsty for longOverall as buffets go this is a very good one definitely worth trying out The hustle and bustle probably rules it out if youre looking for a quiet romantic meal but who goes to a buffet for that anyway but there are plenty of seats so going with a group of friends wouldnt be a problemBy the way 50 off until April 16th to celebrate its opening so give it a try soon"

    "review":"A random Italian place with great service If they have it do the frutti di mare Comes with A TON of seafood We were pleasantly weirded out by the quantityWe walked down the street looking for a place to eat Saw the place was packed and looked at the menu Decided it must be good because its so busy We were right  The waiters are the best and the foods is very tasty   To top it off we ended with desserts Ohhhhh sticky toffee pudding So yummy  This is definitely a place to visit in your travels  Would become a regular if we lived hereThis was recommended to m by the hotel staff at the Hilton I was staying at and its a small restaurant that youve probably passed a millions times and never thought twice Think again it was such a delicious meal One of the better Italian restaurants Ive eaten at Homemade noodles Homemade sauce HOMEMADE ICECREAM They have many awards for their ice cream and I strongly suggest on savings some room for something sweet The menu is overwhelming so I would ask the servers to help you narrow down to what youre in the mood for They are a wide variety of items pizza pastas calzones starters and salads Its perfect for a family night out or something smaller or more intimate I would suggest a table away from the doorI hope you enjoy it as much as I didI have been to bar Italia twice for lunch and I am a little in term of the number of stars i should give this place but due to the fantastic service we had both time my vote is balancing toward the 4 instead of three my first experience there was great my friend ordered a pizza and i ordered pasta and it was all so deliciousHowever the second time i came It was really not as good my friend and I ordered the seafood risotto and we both agree this was not cooked as a risotto but marely as rice in sauce it was not bad overall but not a risotto my other friend ordered the raviolo and some garlic bread the raviolis apparently were good but i found 3 for  4 small slices of garlic bread a little steep I will go back to bar italia but might not try their risotto againGood solid choice for authentic ItalianAmbiance: A little crowded and fills up quickly after noon But clean and appealingService: Considering the amount of people it was very fast but the staff were clearly a little stressed outFood: Nice flavours while being more traditional in the sense that most dished only have a few fresh ingredients and its not hidden under loads of garlic I had the pasta nonna which had tender pieces of steak and fresh pasta My friend had a pizza which was done in the Neapolitan style It was huge and very tasty without being greasy or over the top with the toppingsPrice: A little more than the other Italian joints nearby but better qualityI would go back if given the chanceFrankly Id give it more stars if Yelp let meThis is exactly the kind of Italian restaurant a foodie like me appreciates Not too fancy great vibe awesome food and above all great staffMy girlfriend and I went in there hungry You tend to over order when youre hungry you know So we wanted to start off with a large size Antipasto and a small Calamari Our server Christian was kind enough to let us know that the large size Antipasto is pretty substantial and getting that and the Calamari would be a bit too much So we listened to him and went for the small size Antipasto and Calamari Sure enough the portion size was great Not to mention how delicious they were For the main course we had squid ink pasta Cavatelli Al Sapore di Mare and my girlfriend had the Cavatelli con Nduja They were both very tasty Pasta was cooked al dante and the seasoning in the sauces is just on point Im guessing all the other pastas should be great as well so really no matter what you get there its going to be greatWhat I want to emphasize on tho is their ice cream Man do they have good ice cream They make their ice cream in house so thats a good start Theyve made their ice cream into all kinds of fancy sundaes large or small But we went for the simple choice just one scoop of vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso on the side When they arrive just pour the espresso over the ice cream and enjoy the rich flavors melt together This way its never overly sweet and theres just this hint of rich bitterness in the sweet and velvety ice cream Perfection it isThe meal totaled around 50 pounds which is not cheap by any means But if you ask me a high quality meal like this for 50 pounds thats as good of a deal as you can get just about anywhere We had two draft beers as well btw without them it should be just a bit over 40Chris even gave us some post cards from Italy Ive been to a good amount of Italian restaurants all over the places and this is a first I know its not much really but the feeling you get when treated this friendly is just beyond words If I get a chance to go back to Edinburgh Bar Italia would undoubtedly be my first and last meal there"

    "review":"Great place for lunch Love their salad selectionHad a lovely breakfast here with my husband and little one on a sunny morning  The space is beautiful filled with lots of natural light The menu is small  Our order:  The Scottish Breakfast for him which he raved about the coconut Bircher for me also excellent scone for the little one which was only okay  My only complaint is that the service was slow  A number of parties sat down were brought menus and then walked out after waiting for someone to come take their order  After our food came no one came by to check to see if we were okay or to see if we wanted out billChickpea burger was just all right but the chips were terrific  Good beer selection  The hummus they were selling when we were there was very tastyThey do a very brisk trade at Earthys selling themselves on the idea of wholesome and organic fare and charging accordingly Sadly their food isnt really all that much of either and their service certainly isnt briskIve been coming here every few months since not long after they opened and in the beginning their food was very tasty and their staff friendly and decently efficient It didnt take long for the honeymoon period to end however After a while I realised that their food is predominantly not organic Their eggs are which is good but their produce could be tesco value for all I know much of the time That doesnt stop them using marketing language and a feel that encourages people to assume theyre the organic option in an area with a lot of halfdecent placesTo be fair: Their meat seems to mostly be local at least and Scotland is pretty decent for animal welfare standards I dont eat meat anymore so that doesnt affect me but its good to knowIf you have read my other reviews youll know that Im a bit of a coffee nut Some would say snob maybe And I quickly gave up on having a coffee with my lunches here Its Okay for most I guess But if youre a brew lab artisan roast machina regular you wont like what you get here is my entirely predictive and accurate assumptionTheir food has gotten less and less worth the money and while the fritters I had today were decent enough they were not good enough or generously enough portioned for the 750 I paid The fritters themselves were laid out on some fresh greens that were absolutely drenched in fat See photoNow the waiting I get that theyre busy and popular but waiting for 25 minutes to get a seat at the window we were very nearly bypassed by someone who walked straight in and was shown to a table straight away until we intervened and then 10 minutes to order and another 30 for a sandwich and some fritters Inexcusable The staff are friendly but from a place that has been consistently busy for years I expect better organising than this We ended up going to the toll to pay as they didnt bring us the bill after we asked for it either Bye bye Earthy We had some good times but those are clearly over Youre too expensive and too slow for the level of quality you provideAbsolutely amazing breakfast I had the waffles which I did not regret The place also has a really good organic store next doorWe had the full Scottish breakfast and I give it an easy 5 stars So tasty Each ingredient was amazing quality  the bread especially was perfect The only negative was the coffee Not bad but not great either  Service was really good and we had a big hug of water with fresh mint in it placed on the table straight away A grand experience"

    "review":"This is a fantastic little and it IS little restaurant Its French so of course the wine will be good We had escargots 12 of them  the antipasta plate for starters Followed by the beef bourguignon and trout then a cheese plate for dessert All very civilized and deliciousI highly recommend this place Give it a try should you happen to be in the area or make a special trip  I think its worth itThis is a tough one On the one hand it felt very genuinely French The staff were all French and the food was as good and mmmtastic as you mind find in a Parisian cafeOn the other the service was really quite lacking The waiters were all friendly and chatty But it was more the general air of confusion disorder and muted chaos that seemed to prevail I had stopped by here with an old friend for a proper good catchup and wasnt in a rush We had the whole afternoon Had I however been on a tight time schedule I could see myself getting very antsy about how sloooowww it wasWe arrived at 1pm our first order of sandwiches was taken fine But when we asked to see the menu again for desserts no one came back to take our order after half an hour I went up to the counter to place my order but was told hed come over He did in a very charming French way with broken English Only to tell us our order  crepes au chocolat and eclair  were both finished At 2pm on a Saturday So we ordered a pastry and creme brulee About half an hour later the same waiter emerged with poached pears looking very confused when we said we didnt order thatWe did eventually get our order which seemed to be the only two desserts left on the menu And they were delicious And the waiter incredibly charming Did you have a nice moment Me: moment oh you mean time Did we have a nice time Him Ah oui yes pardon my English is not so goodOverall I was still a satisfied customer as my croque monsier with smoked salmon was delicious as was my pastry And I think it was the friendliness and charm of the staff that saved the cafe Had they been just as inattentive but also rude I would have been very unhappyWe spent 3 12 hours here chatting eating drinking tea It has a lovely ambience Its traditional and feels very genuinely French And the food we had was good I just wish they HAD had crepes and they were perhaps a bit more organisedI will be coming back and shall also be brushing up on my French for a bit more friendly chat with those waitersFour of us stopped by Le Marche Francais for lunch one Friday afternoon Unfortunately it wasnt a great experienceInside its got a nice continental deli type vibe going on but is a bit dingy in the main dining areaFoodwise the menu reads well and has a nice variety of dishes However this is pretty much where the positives end We had a vegan with us and after asking the waitress what they could offer we were met with a blank stare After some explaining and her consulting with the chef we were told they could do salad When it came this salad was not a salad It was an insult to salad and our vegan diner It consisted of one type of lettuce leaf with a couple slices of roasted pepper probably from a jar and nothing else Nothing No other veg no dressing nothing There were plenty ingredients they clearly had available based on their menu that any semicompetent chef could have made a half decent vegan dish out of This was just thoughtless and lazy And it was still charged at full price for the goats cheese and roast veg saladI ordered the Tuna Nicoise Upon arrival it became very clear that serving offensively bad food was a theme The Nicoise was bizarrely served on a sharing dish  a big wedge shaped plate with small compartments for oilsvinegars etc But instead of filling these small teaspoon sized compartments with oils or vinegars they opted to put the olives minutely chopped green beans half a hardboiled egg and obviously canned tuna The larger part of the plate contained yet again one type of salad leaf although I was privileged to also get half a cherry tomato on top but that was it It was bland and unsatisfyingWe also ordered the Provencal Chicken Billed as tender chicken fillet in a tomato and olive sauce and served with provencal vegetables Turns out provencal vegetables are overcooked mushy brussel sprouts nothing else The chicken was dry and the tomato sauce was completely tasteless I kid you not it somehow didnt even taste of tomatoNext up is the Salad Oceane Or prawn cocktail by any other name Although it did have some smoked salmon through it Albeit so minutely sliced along with my green beans Id wager that the chef is either a Borrower or has really tiny handsOverall a very poor show from Le Marche Francais Im guessing that most of their custom comes from the takeaway coffee and sandwiches that local office workers buy because their restaurant food contained absolutely none of the flavour flair or creativity youd expect from French cookingWe were staying for a week in a nearby hotel while househunting in Edinburgh  Le Marche Francais was practically across the street  They were not open the first 3 days we were there end of New Years holiday with no sign to indicate when they would openThat lack of information is the only reason Im not rating this 4 stars  The food was wonderful and very fresh  Oh how I love a ham baguette and this delivered in addition to the other treats we enjoyed  This will be a favorite stop after we move to Edinburgh next monthWe stopped in Le Marche for lunch and were pleased there was a special  You could pair soup with a sandwich or a special entree on that particular day it was chicken in a mustard sauce with vegetable and a side salad and also got a coffee  The red pepper soup was delicious  The wait staff was very polite  The food was simply good and affordable  The atmosphere of the place was clean and cafelike  Recommended for casual relaxed dining or coffeeWas there today Thursday for brunch Service was bad there was only croque monsieurs for sale and no soupService was slow 10mn to get 2 glasses of tap waterNo impressed"

    "review":"I love the idea of Zest take some of the Easts finest flavours and combine them with old Scottish FavouritesThe restaurant itself is a decent size you only really feel cramped when it fills up which seems to be alotLast time I was here I had the Salmon Tikka which was made with freshly caught fish from that day To say I was blown away is an understatement the flavours explode in your mouthStaff made sure I had what I needed and prices overall were ok Dont eat breakfast and go at lunchtime and get the group special Youll be there for hoursI came here in mid February shortly after the restuarant had had its makeover under new ownership  The interior feels light spacious and the creamy decor helps to give a nice relaxed atmosphere  It tries to give a fine dining impression but the spindly metal chairs and tables kind of let this look down  The waiters are pleasant and the service is about what you would expect in any restaurantThe food is by far this places key feature  The menu has a good range of authentic Indian dishes with plenty of meat and vegetarian starters and main courses to choose from  Further it tries to incorporate local history with its Indian cuisine  For example I had the Sir Walter Scott curry which was lamb in a really rich tasty mustard sauce  Im not sure what the link between this dish and the author is precisely but you can see what theyre trying to doZest is also reasonably priced making it a great option for lunch of dinner if youre in the areaAfter a beautifull sunday in the town we dropped in at Zest The service was good the food from mild to really hot: great We had a starter two main courses and only one desert because then we were full The bill was not as high as we feared after all the high prices we saw in the cityThe people working there were so nice I feel badly giving it only 3 stars  but the wine was undrinkable gewurztraminer and our vegetarian dishes were not the best Ive had  We ordered the aubergines which were differently prepared than Ive eaten before but pretty good and the lentils that had the consistency of split pea soup  lacked flavorI almost fell out of my chair at how expensive our meal was but Im not from around here  am not accustomed to UK prices yet I appreciated that they were open late otherwise we would have gone hungryBEST CURRY EVER I Love the food here its all prepared wonderfully and delicious The staff is kind and quick too always with a smile on there face Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice and affordable place to eat with great food Try the Tikka Masala with Nan breadA very outgoing and great restaurantStaffs are very friendly and politeFood are very good especially the dessertReally nice place to goLike it so much"

    "review":"Located in an area crowded with coffee shops Project Coffee a great place The coffee is very good and the cakes are pretty tasty  The service is good too without being overfriendly The interior is quite stylish keeping with the identity of the neigbourhood and you have a mix of comfy sofas tables and a counter by the large windows where you can just sit and do some people watching The music is pretty good not too loud and bless no wifi so none of the herds of students you get in other places A great place to meet a friend for coffee cake and gossipI cant really judge this place as I only had a chai while there but going off the scones and atmosphere I would say it is a nice stop in the Bruntsfield area It was right next to where our family booked a holiday stay and every time we walked by it was full and busy The initial service was a big slow considering how busy they were but they were friendly and we got our drinks very quickly The scones were very delicious and well sized for sharing The chai was okay very sweet but fine if you are looking to It over dose on coffee My sister in law said the coffee was good and it looked well made so I think it would be a good option if you are looking for something less crafty then Artisan Roast The only annoying thing is that they have these fluorescent lights which are very unattractive and makes it feel more like a quick stop cafeteria then a nice warm cafe The interior is very nice with rough brick walls and a comfy couch in the back but the lights make it not a very nice place to sit for too long  All in all a nice stop for a quick drink on the goThis is one of the places I always pass by via bus from home in Morningside to the city centre  It looks like a serious coffee place  One flat white later well yes yes it isI entered ordered then started the hunt for a seat  Scavenging as much as my personal scootching radius allowed I spotted the perfect campout  The arrival of my much anticipated mug already got me digging this place  But to my sad bewilderment I realised they have no wifi Usually not requiring connection 247 this is not my norm for a downside in an establishment  I can contently identify as a Ludditehad I no need to work  But that was the day I had to work  In brief my wonderful coffee was gone too fast and I had to do a comfort coffee over at EH10 with WIFINo WiFi  not good for project workSo what I am fickle and this is my favorite coffee in the city now Luckily the gentleman caller or I guess I would be the caller I associate with lives around the corner from it I have a small beast at home and I need to make sure she is alive so I rarely make my way to call I guess But when I do its for the lovin AND the coffee I dont ever care about food at coffee shops because well I dont go to coffee shops for food Sometimes its necessary to eat because I want coffee at an eating time but the purpose is clear COFFEE and when I want coffee I want hereI rolled into town after two days of international plane travel famished and tired  I ordered the equivalent of the irish breakfast  The haggis is the best Ive had  The egg and potato scone were delish  The tea was the right temp and strength  Everything was divinely perfectI take off a star bc when I returned a week later for the same experience the food was like the step sister of the former  Same food not as fresh tasting or warm or crunchy  Its like it had sat under a warmer too long  Or just a different person behind the stove  Oh well"

    "review":"I walk past the Thai Lemongrass restaurant in Bruntsfield quite a lot and although I am a big fan of Thai food I had never actually had a meal there My Edinburgh Thai restaurant of choice is the Thai Orchid on Johnston Terrace and its so good that Ive never needed to get my fix from anywhere else I thought I should give this place a chance though just in case I was missing out on something The restaurant is nicely lit and tastefully decorated Id describe it as understated Eastern: the walls are a gold colour and theres some bamboo and a tasteful Buddha These are nice surroundings in which to have a meal but there are no discerning features to speak ofThe service was very professional I wouldnt describe it as friendly but it was certainly efficient The food was brought out in a timely manner and there was always a waiter on hand to replenish drinks and clear away platesThe food itself was nice enough but there was nothing that particularly stood out and I was intensely disappointed by the lack of Som Tam on the menu this should be an obligatory item in every Thai restaurantThe real shock of the evening came when we were presented with the bill  70 This seemed to be a little steep for dinner for two with one bottle of wine our meal was nice but I would normally expect a bit more for that sort of priceThe Thai Lemongrass is a family run restaurant and has a very authentic Thai feel to it  The staff wear traditional Thai clothing and the decor inside is very oriental There is a wide range of Thai dishes on the menu with a substantial vegetarian section They offer Thai Banquets which have a set menu with a wide range of dishes on offer and for a two course meal it costs 20 per person not including drinks or desertI came here as a student with a friend and we were quite taken aback at the rather steep prices as we assumed that because the restaurant was in a student area it would be relatively cheap The meal itself was very tasty I had the chicken in a red curry sauce and it was lovely and spicy and I found the service attentive I have not been back since purely because of the expensive nature of their menu but I would like to eat there again as the meal was very tasty just maybe not at those pricesYum This place serves up reliably delicious authentic Thai food for a decent price with quality service It is fast becoming my favourite restaurant The staff are looking to please perhaps a little too keen to take your order but not invasive or overbearing in their presence They are very friendly and are happy to bring an extra plate of prawncrackers while you chat away with your fellow diners or mull over the menu As mentioned in my opening line the food is delicious Ive sampled a reasonable spread in the menu and have not yet been disappointed Very tasty but not too salty or over seasoned yum The wine list is good but only one wine of each colour comes by the glass Dinner for two complete with bottle of wine shared starter two mains and two bowls of rice for approx 45This is my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh The staff are so friendly and welcoming but never fuss over you The food is to die for certainly my last meal would be the chicken satay followed by the prawn pad Thai washed down with Sancerre wine The price is I would say mid range Ive been going to this fantastic wee eaterie for years I hope it never closes a golden treasure of EdinburghSwift and pleasant service although being the only customers prior to 6pm on a cold and damp Tuesday night there wasnt much competition to slow things downWe only had tea and mains  both dishes and the sticky rice which at least comes in the bowl and not a plastic bag withing it like as was the case at another Thai place earlier in the year went down well Overall a good dining experienceA great place to cut your teeth if youve never tried Thai before although I cant imagine many people not having tried something This place seems to trying to sway you towards a buffet rather than giving you things straight off the menu My waitress seemed very adamant that we give that a try almost like her life depended on itI understood as soon as I got the bill 21 a head The buffet was good but I certainly didnt eat 21 worth"

    "review":"Popular haunt for all types youll be lucky to get a seat after 9 any night of the weekend serving a good range of beers  spirits Interesting mixed toilets deal going onIm in love with Edinburgh and the Brass Monkey is perfectly representative of the Edinburgh way of life Easy going and cozy my only complaint is that I dont live here and cant frequent this place I want to open up a bar like this there needs to be more places where you can cuddle and drink This place is actually the coolestThis pub has the huge advantage of having a cinema in the back room which Ive been to many times for various university society film screenings Its a fantastic amenity which brings me back again and again The pub itself is small but very nice and drinks are moderately priced Theres always a jovial atmosphere and they have a selection of inhouse movies which can be watched if no group has booked the cinema roomAside: the cinema room is so comfortable with lovely couches and cushions Get a drink settle down and enjoy the movie :I used to spend a lot of time in Edinburgh but I never got to experience and good pubs there Now Im going out with someone domiciled in Edinburgh its good to actually go to good pubs I liked the Brass Monkey For Edinburgh City Centre the prices are pretty good For a pint of Beer and a vodka and lemonade it was only 640 The prices are practically Glaswegian I liked the atmosphere too There were plenty of places to sit through the back they have these massive beds you can sit on The music was decent too My favourite part of the Brass Monkey was the retro arcade game We had a game of Pac Man which as two dyspraxics we were obviously terrible atWent with some friends that had rented out the movie room The bar was small and seemed normal got a drink but had it in the movie room The idea was cool but the movie room was small  and the seating area that more like a lounge area with pillows was super dirty and gross One of the speakers was broken so it changed the mood of the movie for sure Based on the cleanliness alone I would never go back but the concept was cool What the Bejesus Theyve taken out the cinema from Brass Monkey Butbutbut now its just a pub Some utter arsehole has taken out all the beds and replaced them with proper tables GrrrrWell hopefully this is just for the festival and will resort to being one of the quirkier pubs in Edinburgh By now everyone pretty much knows that Brass Monkey is half pub half indieesque cinema There is a huge bed with a load of mattresses squashed together and tables in the middle fitting about 20 odd people on it In front of this theyve put up a big projector screen so you can see a really good selection of cult films This is how all cinemas should be chilling out with booze and food on a bed The only downside is that there is sometimes a certain footish smell lingering aroundThe rest of the bar is tiny but pretty cool The toilets are behind an old saloon style wall where they have a list of all the available films The bar is pretty small and cramped but they have a good range of drinks including 250 cocktails The staff are all friendly and its overall a really cool place to drink"

    "review":"Salads Really good salads Inexpensive In Edinburgh Excellent spot for lunch in grassmarket I came here on my lunch break today after passing by many times and Im so glad I finally decided to pop in Its a nice spacious cafe I got my food for take away but I could definitely see myself enjoying a tasty lunch inside too I was so so excited to see a large lists of salads on their menu And quite a range too I spotted chicken caesar roasted vegatable falafel tuna salad many options for whatever your taste They also have coffee paninis a breakfast menu and more menu items that I cant remember I opted for the roasted pear salad It Was Delicious And such a deal for 395 for the large size The man at the counter might be the owner let me know it would be a little while to prepare the salad so I took a seat and flipped through some newspapers It really wasnt that long of a wait and it was definitely worth any extra time Lovely leafy lettuce tasty slices of bacon bits of blue cheese toasted walnuts sweet roasted pear and a balsamic dressing Mmm And he threw in some free breadThe staff were extremely friendly and personable and I hope more people visit their cafe A great addition to the area I will definitely be back to try out the rest of their menuWhile in town on business staying at the Apex I went here every morning for coffee and once for a panini  They make a great latte  Very reasonably priced too  The staff here is very friendly and made me feel at home  If youre staying at either of the Apex Hotels on Grassmarket please check this place out youll be happy you did  Please note  they accept cash onlyJoe A had built this one up to be a good one A wee place tucked in between Foodies and Tescos near Holyrood Park it serves up packed wraps and salads at amazingly lower prices  and after only one salad I know Ill be backIt was the Weeping Tiger wrap that I came here for but my evening meal plans scuppered that Im going out for a bucket of meat later that night so a wrap packed full of pulled pork did not sound sensible I opted instead for the Roasted Veg Salad with Pesto It was a nice wee box of fresh salad and quite a few bits of roasted aubergine pepper and onion in a delicious pesto dressingThe Weeping Tiger wrap is where its at though Joe A kindly let me have a bite and good LORD It was almost the same price as the salad 295 vs 350 but lawdy lawdy That was some amazing tender pulled pork and the sauce it came in  sweet spicy Its only on Tuesdays and Fridays and apparently they fly out the door I love it when a place that does simple things sandwich salad and lunch options becomes famous for one thing  and I can see The Weeping Tiger wrap becoming Let Me Eats signature dishI will come back on a night when Im not eating a bucket of meat in order to have the Weeping Tiger wrap  and soon 4 stars from what I tasted the friendly staff and how efficient and quick they were even on a sunny Friday afternoon rushhourShebeen they do actually do buckets of meatSince starting work round here this has become my go to place for coffee and lunchAs JoeA says the main event is for the sure the Weeping Tiger Wraps on Wednesday and Friday but in general they just do awesome and generous food I try to have their salads most days lots of toppings and tasty dressings make even lettuce taste goodTheir Polish specials are always a treat the perogi and the beetroot soup two of my favouritesCool staff and a particularly cute  witty girl that works the till at lunchtime make for a pleasant break when getting lunch They also do a great very well priced coffeeThe music also randomly adds to the experience with some particularly good jazz played most daysMaybe not as refined as their neighbour but more heart and more banterOk so this place just opened today so it was maybe a little disorganised maybe a little frantic when the lunch rush hit but I liked it The best thing about this place it is MEGA cheap All the paninis sandwiches and salads are under 3 Granted my tuna nicoise salad wasnt huge but it was all I needed And 285 or so for a smoked salmon salad pass me three The coffee was tasty and strong The service was nice and friendly they didnt look at me like I was crazy when I asked if the tuna had Mayo in it clearly sensing I didnt want that the reply was Yes but we can make one up for you without it Brilliant Only downside to sitting in to have my quick lunch today is that the tableseats are those awful dinerstyle things that i hate they are not comfortable But I guess this place is more for grabbing something to takeaway Overall I enjoyed it and would go back for sureOh dear oh dear where to beginOnly out of laziness do I come here as often as I do Situated no more than 200 yards from my work if Im going out for lunch its an easy fix And admittedly I do love their Pear Rocket and Walnut salad and thats about the only plus I can muster Im afraidIts hard not to compare Let Me Eat to Thyme which occupied the space in its previous incarnation The former is managed by one of the latters old staff so I think that alone gives me licence And with this in mind I cant help but think theyve looked at what Thyme did and tried to emulate it at half the cost Unfortunately it showsRolls and Paninis arent filled quite so generously as they once were salads are smaller soups less extravagant The whole set up smacks of a bunch of firsttimers trying to make more money by spending less On my last visit I had Chicken Noodle Soup which was chicken stock fair enough Im a fan of that and about 4 noodles and well lets say Im STILL looking for the chicken Thyme used to offer thick broths and meaty beasts packed with flavour and ingredients Red Thai Chicken Meat Ball Smokin Chicken these are soups Let Me Eat offer think stockbased halfeffortsOne morning I opted for toast a bargain at 50p you would think Only both the bread and butter had been frozen overnight so the bread cooled very quickly and the butter was simply a clumped into the centre of the bread and the lad sandwiched it all together in the hopes it would melt into the bread by the time I got to work Alas it did not WoefulIts a shame because the staff are very warm and friendly and Id like them to do well But to succeed with this venture theyre going to have to invest in better produce and deliver heartier portions Otherwise they will inevitably follow the path of the superior Thyme If they couldnt make it these guys dont stand a chance"

    "review":"Owned by Jools Holland you can guess this place is of great quality Situated in a beautiful building on Queen Street you almost feel like youre off to a ball Well I was my university end of term ball But it does feel so much more grander than that The food was so much better than the price tag suggested I imagine this was to do with a deal with the university as I have looked at the restaurant prices and it aint cheap and the ambiance was spectacular The staff made us feel like we were more than just grubby students dressed in our finest gear The whole night was fantastic and I understand why my university uses this venue each year Jam House also operates as a restaurant and an upmarket club It is worth a visit for whatever reason you can findMy boyfriend used to know this girl who thought that the Jam House was the least cool place in town  I think that shes just not cool enough to realise just how cool this place is  Its cool like the 80sIt actually IS cool like the 80s  It has that kind of dorky but majorly fun vibe that is the joy of an 80s party  I almost said  that reminds me of the 80s but thats a lie Im way too young to remember the 80s  A previous reviewer said that its like going to a family wedding because of the all ages crowd  That is completely true and is one of the JEMs what disguises itself as a typo is really my brain reminding me that I do remember some of the 80s of this place      The majority of people who go to the Jam House arent out for a pretentious night out they just want to listen to some good music and dance without caring whos watching  Yeah you will probably end up dancing with a dad and make his night or with a mom who is wearing heels for the first time in years and can hardly stand up  That is all part of the charm of the Jam HouseIn exchange you will find that the door charge is one of if not the cheapest in New Town and and the bar considerably easier to get to than anywhere else on a weekend  Ive never eaten here so cant comment on that aspect but the quality of the night out is well cool  Like the 80sThis place is apparently owned by Jools Holland Or at least Jools Hollands people Therefore youd probably expect good jazzy bluesy live music Not a DJ playing AbbaSClub megamixThe bar staff looked like they were there under duress When I ordered two cocktails the chap looked at me like I just asked for two pints of his kids blood The vodka martini served was appallingIt was also the Jam Houses 10th birthday and they had a couple of trays of chocolate cake at the bar for guests But when I say chocolate cake I mean a gateau that had been butchered in to slicesI had to laugh at th ads on the big screens for the birthday celebrations though Pics of the likes of Ben E King Martha Reeves and Jools himself supposedly as Jam House favourites When all around me it was hen parties and dodgy middle aged dads out on the pullTo be fair there was a band setting up but lord knows what they were going to play We didnt last long I sank a pint of beer and it was quitting timeHaving purposefully avoided coming here over the last eight years or so it took a bit of arm twisting to for me to break my ban on Easter Sunday but the prospect of nonstop Northern Soul clinched itThankfully the place wasnt uncomfortably busy once we got there so that was a bonus Other than that though the things that had put me off in the past are still in evidence namely poor acoustics benefit of the doubt  the PA and shoddy mic in use may have been the organisers rather than the venues and they still dont stock tomato juice so bloody marys are out of the question Best left to the older  older at heart for the better part of another decade I thinkI was dragged here once by my 57 year old auntie who was looking to pull I think that sums it up Jools Holland owns it which gives it some credit I suppose and its nicely decorated inside but its not my cup of tea It seemed to be a playground for the over 50s looking to relive their youth It reminded me of dad dancing at a wedding  you know the sort On several occasions sweaty old men made their move towards me at which point I hastily circled the roomFoodwise it wasnt anything special either I had panfried chicken without realizing it doesnt come with anything else should have ordered sides Yeah it was ok and the price wasnt too bad but nothing worth going out my way forBilly Ocean Live performance Friday 20th April 2012 Tried to get a booking in the venues restuarant but left it too late as they were sold out completely Bought tickets to see the UKs biggest selling soul performer Arrived to a busy venue but was served extremely quickly Plenty of bar staff on duty and good cheery service given Started on cocktailsBad move though still have headache on Monday Got a postion right at the front of the stage Billy Ocean took to the stage at 930pm and performed for a full two hours without stopping Covered all his hits from the 70s80s Great performance and full marks to The Jam House for bringing this legend to Edinburgh Night was rounded off by dancing to the Jam House resident DJ who played a great mix of 60s70s and 80s souldisco tracks"

    "review":"Haqs is a good quality Indian takeaway on Leith Walk which offers great food and pretty fast delivery  My flatmates and I ordered a curry from here last year and it arrived speedily and at a fairly reasonable price  We had one their menus put under our door earlier in the year and decided to give them a shot when none of us could be bothered cooking or walking to get a takeaway  My only complaint of Haqs is that the phone call to order the food was about as strenuous as walking to the nearest Indian probably would have been  My mate had to repeat just about every detail twice and was literally screaming our address down the phone at the guy  After this however the food seemed to take no time to arrive and only cost about 89 each including delivery  I had the chicken Kathmandu which was delicious with good quality meat but just about blew my head off it was so hot  I would recommend Haqs for delivery just practise your elocution prior to the phone callIts been quite a while since I reviewed a take away  so its a good job then that Haqs was a pretty interesting subject to write aboutFirstly the food here is amazing  the traditional indian cooking is splendid and I promise you whatever you choose you wont be dissapointed No case of food envy hereThe take away service is varied however sometimes it is a well executed delivery and other times it is so messed up you wonder how Haqs can get away with it Theres no middle ground with the take away service  its either great or shockingOver all though the quality of the food and the fact it is only around a tenner each for a banquet means I actually really rate this place highlyIve been here twice now once when I first moved here and then a few weeks ago The first time I wasnt blown away but I cant remember why not either Since we cant find Chinese to meet our needs we branched out to Indian The guy who always works the counter is lovely and they offer a student discount which is decent They also deliver for free locally and are very cheap which is fantastic if you are feeling like some good Indian but low on funds They have so many currys to choose from and all spice levels The currys are tasty and big portioned the special rice or nonnormal rice has red and green colored rice which is weird but I believe you can get normal white rice They offer two meal deals which are less then 17 quid and you can get either veggie or meat It is certainly an easy takeaway option and doesnt disappoint if you want a quick cheap curry Not amazing but for the price it is tasty and you cant really complainYum My friend and I have ordered several different curries from here and they have all been delicious From the super spicy to the sweet and tangy its all been delicious and filling We really like the free pakoras you get on orders over 20 and they make really great Chapati Its so rare to find such good chapati in Indian restaurants anywhere but Haqs definitely did not disappoint What a great place for take away Totally worth it"

    "review":"I really really want to like this cafe and I do  somewhat I have very mixed feelings about it though I will start with the positives: It is light bright and aesthetically pleasing The ceiling is all glass the floors are wooden It is modern but built into and shares the stone wall of an ancient church It has views out onto a picturesque churchyard through the back and opens onto a wellkept pleasant garden on the side You can bring your toddler here to play with lots of toys You can sit on a sofa in the corner drink a coffee and nurse your newborn  along with lots of other mothers babies and children It is one of the only cafes in town that caters directly to parentswithsmallchildren So it is a place in which you can relax with a cup of coffee and your toddler without eliciting the annoyed glares of other childless customers Which brings me to what I struggle with here It it is chaotic And I do not think that it has to be On my recent visit Friday for the two hours I spent there no tables were bused despite dirty dishes piling up and there seeming to be ample staff around We never were able to sit in the cozy couch corner as it was never cleared of the leftover dishes and food of previous customers The toy corner for the children although very much appreciated is in dire need of a bit of care  and perhaps replacement I am more than willing to tolerate the inevitable chaos of small children but I would like to enjoy a somewhat tidy and clean place to do it in The menu also caters to small things and this is also much appreciated But the choices for beverages for little ones seemed to be exclusively ribena and sugar supplemented juice drinks Maybe I just caught them at the end of a busy week but in looking for a wee snack there appeared to be more than a few items on offer that were prepackaged sweets  not something I would expect in a cafe So I am torn here There is a lot to like about this cafe and my small child loves it but there is some to be desired as well But if you have a baby or a small child and you really want to relive your preparenthood cafe life this is one of the few places in Edinburgh you can head for Give it a try and see what you think"

    "review":"Apart from a welcome that was bordering on brusque and the fried eggs being slightly underdone breakfast here on Sunday past was a pleasant experience Good large helpings as well as enough toast for a very reasonable 520 Pleasant waitress and not a long wait between ordering and getting served so all in all a pleasant experienceThis restaurant was okay the first time I ate there but I returned yesterday and was extremely disappointed Two of my friends ordered the full breakfast and not only were their eggs undercooked the whites were still raw and runny but there was MOLD on their toast They told the waitress and she brought them new bread I ordered the haggis roll and got two gray pieces of haggis on a cold hamburger bun that you could buy in the store When we went to pay the bill I saw they had charged me an extra 60p for my sandwich so we asked the waitress why and she said I had ordered an extra topping I told her I had only had the haggis and she replied that the haggis IS the extra topping A plain hamburger bun with NOTHING on it is 195 and anything you put on it is an additional 60p Either the menu is very misleading or she had no idea what was going on because I have never heard of that before She was incredibly rude about it and said Well youre wrong but whatever and took the 60p off the bill Terrible place my friends and I will never returnThe Olive Tree was a pleasant caffeine stop before my bands late night gig recently in Edinburgh We were attracted by the exterior which was welcoming and cosey Upon arriving it seemed the staff were surprised to see us And it was empty besides a couple having food We didnt let this put us off and indulged in some lattesDespite being almost empty a few of the tables were yet to be cleaned and that the staff still stood idly by The cakes looked lovely but the cabinet wasnt the cleanest either which made us reluctant to come back and try them The toilet consisted of one large room which was dirty and lacking in toilet roll Otherwise my chai latte was lovelyMy husband and I stopped in here for a coffee enroute to another appointment  The exterior looked nice and inviting but it was a bit different inside  When we stepped through the door the place was totally empty apart from two members of staff having food and working on a lap top they looked a bit surprised to see us but stopped eating and showed us to a table  There was no music on which left the place silent and a bit unwelcoming  They did put music on after taking our coffee order which helped certainly as it did with a couple of other folk arriving The late and mocha both looked the part in nice tall glasses but didnt taste the best  It was super sweet with no real chocolate flavour I wonder if it was cheap hot chocolate powder I never finished my mocha which is unheard ofLooking around you get the impression that this little bistro has once been loved but it feels like the relationship is over there were light bulbs out in every light fitting and a general tired feeling for the place"

    "review":"My flatmates and I visitited Tikka Mahal shortly after it first opened during the summer last year  The menu looked entising and relatively cheap from the outside so we decided to give it a go  The decor inside was pretty nice with newly painted yellow walls shiny mirrors  Its intended to be a takeaway as well a restaurant and probably does equal trade through both  We decided to sit in and we all ordered a curry with rice and a naan  I opted for the chicken rogan josh which didnt take too long to arrive and tasted great when it did  The portions were also excellent and the meal only cost us about 7 each  My only criticism is that at that time we were probably some of their first customers and they were keen to see what our reactions were to the food so it felt like we were being constantly watched whilst trying to eat which was irritating  I doubt youd have that problem if you went now though and Tikka Mahal is a wellpriced Indian with great foodTikka Mahal is fairly recent on the takeaway scene in Edinburgh and it has made a pretty big impression on me Situated in the Newington area of Edinburgh Tikka Mahal is just a short walk from the city centre and it is very close to the University so it is a convenient place for students to go to for dinner Despite being called Tikka Mahal giving the impression that it is a curry house they also do kebabs burgers pizzas and fish and chips  so a bit of everything I came in with a friend who ordered a chicken korma curry with rice which he said was really tasty and the rice was well cooked I had a burger and chips which also tasted really good and the portions were a decent size Our meals came to about five pounds each which was a really good deal There is quite a substantial dining area inside the shop and Tikka Mahal also does takeaways as well as home deliveries which is incredibly convenient  I havent been back since but I had a good experience here I definitely plan to go backI absolutely LOVE Tikka Mahal It is the only place for Indian  Pakistani food in Edinburgh They are very gracious when you walk in and all food is prepared fresh to order The quality of the chicken is fantastic and you never get weird chewy parts like I often find at other cheap establishments Both the chicken karahi and the chicken rogan josh are divine They roll our the naan bread fresh right there for you Im a HUGE fanThis is a little gem of an establishment The wife and I love Indian food but the majority of the Indian takeaways these days are extortionate Not Tikka Mahal Wife kids and I can get curried up for only 20 Youd pay that for just ONE curry elsewhere in Edinburgh Very reasonable prices and tasty foodThey serve quite a variety of food Pizzas Kebabs and Fries etc You can either sit in or take away We always sit in as its quite a quaint and cozy little placeA must visit when in Edinburghchicken korma takeaway was delicious  sweet sauce and tender chickenhuge portion  one order was enough for 2 people enough sauce for both rice and nan cheese nan was giant and awesomei wanted good and family run kind of indian restaurant in my last day in edinburgh i found this restaurant on tripadvisor and lucky that i did i ordered chicken with okra in some kind of curry sauce and garlic naan bread topped with a mango lassi all that for under 10 british pound wow food is made fresh to order it was a little greasy but god everything is so tasty i dont mind at all and the mango lassi comes in a pint no kidding too much for one person really but i had my water bottle with me so i poured the excess into it for later tasty good honest family style indian food for so little money portions are big i skipped lunch and only had a snack since breakfast so i devoured everything i probably could not have if i had had a regular sized lunch well the other customers tend to take the leftovers home so i guess that it is okay too what a great find and wonderful way to stay warm in a cool and damp fall evening in scotland"

    "review":"I havent been for burgers yet but went for a couple of beers with the yelp crew after a great zombie event It was a nice place to go for a beer even if it was a tad pricey The staff were friendly and let us all dressed as zombies chill in the front of the bar Not something I would go out of my way for but I wouldnt complain there I will check out the burgers and update this in the futureAverage would sum up my experience here The burger was ok but there was a certain lack of flavour about the meat and Im not sure all of the components came together I had the Dirty South that well The fries were just warm enough The beer list was extensive but damn expensive Also a huge proportion were sold out Service was friendly enough but we had to ask for further drinks orders to be taken and while its never nice to be pestered you do like to be asked periodically Heres a caveat  this was a visit in August and there were 25 of us and while those two things combined may contribute to a reduced experience it shouldnt really effect a place situated on the Royal Mile  its not like they didnt know it would be busy Edinburgh has some brilliant burger options Burger Red Squirrel to name two and Ill not be rushing back here to give it another go SorryJust OK If you only serve burgers they should be great Mine was just okay nothing special Onion rings were undercooked and too greasy My dinner companion felt the same way Free wifi was a plusVery tasty burger nice ambiance insideStrap on the feed bags unbuckle your belt and get ready for a large meal Its greatGood food the first night I got take away I enjoyed the burger so I went in the next night I have a guide dog and I was refused service by the manager after I had already been seated and served drinks When I informed him my dog was a service animal guide dog he still said I had to leave This is the only place I have been discriminated against in the UK  Maybe he needs to read The Equality Act  2010"

    "review":"As the name suggests this is quite a traditional pub And if youre into your whiskies then youll be in heaven here as they have over 20 different types ranging from the Highlands to as far afield as Japan If youre more of a real ale drinker the good thing about this place is the constantlychanging selection of guest ales to choose from alongside the two resident onesBut there are lots of girlfriendly drinks to choose from too: their house wine is definitely among the nicer ones Ive had a pub recently and the white is always nicely chilledThe main thing I love about this place though has to be the food If youre a student you get 10 off and the portions are really generous so its great value for money Dont make the mistake I did though you will not be able to finish the nachos on your own Not if you plan on doing anything other than sleep for the rest of the day anyway They also do really good burgers and you build the exact combination of fillings yourself so youre bound to end up with one that you like Ive never had the sunday roast myself but thats what ill be having next time I go here as my flatmates rave about itWhy not five stars then The music The jukebox is purely punkmetalgothic and although its not blasted really loud like most metal pubs I just find it a bit of a weird combination with the traditional dcor and mainstream foodDont let that put you off though if I could have rated this 4 12 stars I would haveGreat pub in many ways The food is greatnachos and a haggis are enough for two to share Theyve got a couple of different ciders one still and one sparkling both pleasantly dryWonderful place to get away from tourists most of the folks there are university studentsAs locals go this one is probably hard to beat I liked the vibe and clientele mostly students but good craic and atmosphere and the bar looked well stocked and plentiful Where this place excelled was its food I ordered a veggie burrito and it was damn fine Daaaaaamn fine The plate was rammed with a massive burrito loads of rice and sauces to boot Hugely enjoyable pub grub Pals ordered a plate of nachos and they were the largest mountain of chips and topping Ive seen for the price They looked amazing So in short this is the place to come to catch up with pals and get fed to bursting YumGreat place very nice local hang outI cant add anything to Fionas review she nailed it Good place and the burgers a famous around these partsBut The Edinburgh University Goth  Rock Society need to stop meeting in here theyve killed what was a perfectly good jukeboxThe Auld Hoose is excellent  Located just off of the bustling hive of student frenzy that is the main streets of Newington it offers a great alternative for those who often find themselves craving a change of scene from the mainstream unions and bars  One of the things that dramatically stands out about this place is the music  The jukebox is full of metal and rock allowing a more subtle means of enjoying these genres than the more extreme establishments such as Opium on the Cowgate The choice of drinks here is vast lots of ales and wines are available including Hobgoblin on tap This offers a welcome relief from the common draught lagers that are usually prominent elsewhere There is a great variety of wines and the choices are handsomely presented on blackboards located within  The food is great and the large portions offer excellent value  A particular highlight for me would be the nachos they are HUGE I went with three of my other guy friends all of whom are large loons requiring a good feed and we struggled to finish it They come lashed with chilli sour cream guacamole and a generous quantity of cheese Delicious I havent tried any of the other meals on offer but scrolling down the menu there are many traditional dishes such as fish and chips and steak pieI guess the main downside of this place is that it can sometimes seem a bit dark and claustrophobic when it gets busy Finding seating usually isnt a problem unless you leave your arrival until quite late on Fridays or Saturdays However the music can sometimes be too loud and not to everyones taste"

    "review":"Five Guys just got a new fan Back home Five Guys is a super popular chain of burger shops that make delicious hamburgers and seasoned fries Here in Edinburgh I am happy to report that they are the same here Just a great place to enjoy a burger and fries with free refills on drinks Awesome Anyway I stopped in to Five Guys this afternoon with some friends and despite the distance from home it was worth the bus ride The food was fresh the hamburgers were delicious and the customer service was great An added bonus was that the lobby was clean and specious I will definitely be back sometime although at current prices it will only be every once in a while A place to treat myself to a delicious hamburger and fries  a Dr Pepper Thank you Five Guys for the awesome food and Lothian Busses for getting me thereHot tasty quick and friendly service and the music dialled back a bit from the usual Five Guys earsplitting volumeYes im a fan  I dont think you can go much wrong for a burger and fries Yes the menu is limited in general so the vege section is bound to be too but everything they serve is fresh to order and made your way What I mean by that is 15 free toppings to pick fromtheyll also serve you the sauces as dipping sauces rather than on your burger if you prefer Dont think gourmet think damn tasty dirty burger and fries If youre scared of getting a bit of juice on your fingers theres a TGIs or Frankies next door for you to tuck into one with a knife and fork  Yes its 8 for a burger but youd pay an additional 7 in its neighbours for a burger and 6 less in the likes of McDonalds but overall I dont think youll be disappointed Juicy oozey goodness peepsNot impressed today my son and I drove across town to try out the Five Guys at Fort Kinnaird Having just got back from a holiday in California we were curious to compare them with say  InNOut or Carls Junior or something like that Firstly I noticed that there werent any milkshakes or desserts Hmm oh well never mind Then we ordered two big burgers two medium fries and two bottles of Irn Bru total 30Wow Thats not a modest price Sitting down slightly shocked at the bill  we waited to see if the burgers and fries were going to be as amazing as the quotes from various magazines  on the walls suggested Nopethe burgers were fine but not worth the 875 and the fries were ok too butagain not worth the 4I really hoped to be knocked away by the whole visit good food at a reasonable price Im afraid I wasntThere are probably more burger places in Edinburgh than there are Starbucks Coffee shops In my opinion Five Guys is the best you can get The patties are always juicy and perfectly cooked the buns arent overbearing and the fries absolutely steal the show  always perfectly cooked and packed with flavour In my opinion this is the perfect combination for a burger I like it simple There are a couple of things that I dont like about this place though:Firstly the music is always ridiculously loud like stupidly loud almost nightclub loud Dont get me wrong they always play decent music but theres no need to have that dial turned all the way to eleven Next up I love bacon as much as the next guy but Five Guys bacon doesnt do it for me Its very much the american style Way to crispy for my liking but I know some people enjoy that Finally I have to mention the price For what is essentially a fast food takeaway this place is pretty damn expensive Youll probably pay 25 to feed two people Of course I would be happy to pay that in a restaurant but it just feels expensive here This is probably the main reason it loses a starThose points aside I always find myself making the trip up to Fort Kinnaird just for a burger and if there was one in a more central location I would find myself in there pretty damn often My one final tip is always eat as soon as your served If the burger is kept wrapped in the foil for too long it starts to go pretty soggyIf youre looking for a proper American burger joint in Edinburgh then Five Guys will be the ideal restaurant for youAs part of the busy Fort Kinnaird leisure complex it is always really crowded and the staff always look really frazzled trying to keep up with the extreme flow of orders coming through However once you do get your order it will be well worth the waitThe burgers are really juicy and meaty and are always really satisfying to bite into The fries are very crispy and they presalt them so avoid putting salt on them There are also 2 drinks machines in the corner which have the most diverse roster of drinks Ive ever seen My personal favourite is the raspberry fanta It is sweet but with a refreshing tartness to it The atmosphere is a bit noisy with the staff bingo calling order numbers The music is also very noisy as well Apart from this it offers a great all out American experience"

    "review":"I had a very enjoyable lunch at Mother India last weekend The idea of tapasstyle Indian food is very appealing as you get to try a whole variety of dishes rather than just a couple of main courses We split our choices between vegetable sand meat A crispy chilli chicken dosa standard chicken curry mushroom bhaji and okra and potatoes Unlike some asain restaurants they didnt seem afraid to put a bit of a spice kick into their food which was appreciated As another reviewer points out youll need at least one portion of rice per person as they are quite small but the great thijng about the tapas style is you can keep ordering until youve had your fill Service was very friendly and food delivered promptly Id have no hesitation about a return visitVery delicious food authentic flavors Great to find a true Indian restaurant not Bangladeshi Place gets very busy so make reservations Service us prompt and attentive Highly recommendWish I could give this 45 stars really Food was fantastic Had the saag paneer lamb with mint butter chicken and another vegetarian dish Wonderful blend of spice that adds so much delicious flavour The butter chicken has a bit of kick to it but not overpowering just enough to make you sniffle while you eat For two people we ordered four dishes and it was a perfect amount Plus I ordered the three scoop ice cream which was 375 and there was a ton of it The only knock was on the service The server wasnt very attentive and we never had our water refilled Im also getting used to asking for the cheque and not waiting for the server to bring it over All in all wed definitely go back and would be regulars of we lived hereAwful awful place its always crowded so youd think it was good I was really expecting Scottish Indian to be better than London but I was disappointed Put some salt in your food please And if youre a brat like me and not a fan of chicken thighs then youre out of luckCool concept for eating Indian food  perfect for going with a couple of people and trying out a bunch of different dishes Overall everything I had was delicious and I will be going back  definitely recommend this to anyone in the areaFood: overall pretty goodHad chicken tikka makhni and fried garlic mushrooms The chicken dish was very creamy and tasty the only thing was that the chicken itself was bland The fried mushrooms were well spiced Service: not rude yet could def be more friendly or welcoming Ordered rice which did not come so I had to ask again after having all other dishes on the table Food came pretty fast yet they never refilled water Had to wave down someone to get the bill"

    "review":"Grand Cru is a style bar on Hanover St in the city centre which also serves foodThe bar is quite classy and modern there are cosy booths along one wall if youre looking for some comfort and privacy Unfortunately given its proximity to George St in the evenings Grand Cru does tend to attract a rather raucous crowd of yahs although I think a lot of these people are wannabes and not the real thing It is quite a nice place to pop into for a coffee or something stronger when youre doing an afternoons shopping but Id go somewhere else for food I had a jerk chicken salad on my last visit a dish you would expect to be bursting with flavour however it was bland bland bland Given that the wonderful Dogs and Amore Dogs are right across the street youd think Grand Cru wouldve upped its game a bit  they most definitely haventGrand Cru has that handy advantage of being open past the time until 3am that normal bars in Edinburgh get to be open until at the weekend so if its past 1am and you still fancy a drink but not a dance Grand Cru is a useful drinking establishment to be aware ofI do find it a little bit clinical as far as bars go and beyond the limit of busy at the weekend I can be bothered with but theres nothing really wrong with it to be honest so AOK probably describes it fine In fairness the staff are always really nice and tend to give you some good banter while theyre serving you which is always a bonus as a lot of bar staff particularly on a Friday or Saturday night are understandably pushed to the limits of their drink serving ability so theres often not much time for chat But then again you should probably be relying on the mates youre with for conversation not pestering the bar staff for entertainmentThis place opened up with high hopes It looked cool it was in a cool location and the barstaff were hot  the perfect formula rightI came for food with my dad once  the selection was awful we had a choice of 2 dishes and that was that  duck or chicken Inventive The drinks were good though a bit expensive but good nevertheless I had a cosmopolitan and the glass was really funky I felt like I was a child again with a funky strawFull of yahs thoughI love this place Ok so you cold say its yet another expensive bar on or around George Street but theres something about Grand Cru that makes it a little bit different from all the othersMaybe its the huge floortoceiling windows along the front of it which allow for great peoplewatching over a glass of wine with friends in the afternoon or maybe its the clean cut lines of the wooden furniture but something about this place has a trendy yet relaxed feel to itYes drinks are definitely on the pricey side and yes on weekend nights it does get absolutely rammed but for daytime drinking this is definitely one of my favourite spotsIm surprised Grand Cru hasnt just opened as the schoolboy errors that I encountered when I popped in the other night I had just put down as teething troubles Ive never noticed Grand Cru before and I have no idea why as Im in this part of town all the time and its isnt exactly hiddenIm also surprised at reviewers describing this place as classy and posh as lets be honest people it looks rather naff Im not really sure what it is then that drew me in as soon as I walked in and saw the hand typed bar menus I kind of wanted to walk straight back out again but the food was reasonably priced and the restaurant section seats looked pretty comfy so we decided to take a seatI decided to go for the seabass and Bot went for a Caesar salad the seabass as only 950 so I was a little bit sceptical and wasnt hoping for too much just as well then From where we were sitting we could see the window for the kitchen and the staff were flapping about in there like headless chickens in no particular rush to do anything even though the place was quite busy For some odd reason it seemed as though the kitchen light was on a timer as every five minutes or so the light would go out and the clueless staff were plunged into darkness and one of them had to run for the light switch I thought I was in an episode of Fawlty Towers Bots Caesar salad was made in record time and the chef sat it out for the waiting staff to collect but my seabass wasnt ready yet so we watched Bots salad sitting there for a good 10 minutes slowly wilting as my dinner was prepared We finally got our meal and tucked in as we were both starving by this point we didnt hesitate The meal was okay but it was what I was expecting really I was shocked when I bit into my potatoes as they werent cooked You know when you cut a raw potato and its that starchy way and looks oily That what my potatoes were like they were rock hard and just tasted like starch a 12 year old boy could have cooked them better than that Clueless Im just happy that I didnt get a funny tummy after the seabass but at least that was cooked okayQuite frankly this place is a bit of a joke and unless you want to go somewhere for comedy value and if youre thinking about opening up a barrestaurant then head here to see how its NOT done It probably doesnt deserve the one star that Im going to give it but for raw potatoes in a meal and the wide kitchen with the clueless staff thats all Im prepared to give it Oh and also we ordered a bread basket that came with the thickest cut brownishorange most disgusting bread Ive ever seen in my life and no butter The one star goes purely to the comfy chair that we sat on and the friendly waitress who served us who seemed to be the only person who was doing any work and seemed a bit embarrassed to be working thereWent here for lunch and loved it and ended up coming for late night too The food is delicious and cheap and the drinks arent steep either Booths are super comfy and the seating by the huge windows makes for great peoplewatching Caprese  Great starter to share with another Mozzarella has lots of flavor and the tomatoes are fresh Could use a little more basilSteak sandwich  You pretty much get an entire steak wedged between yummy bread with a tasty bearnaise sauce in the middleGoat cheese  roasted pepper panini  Really nice Not too filling and lovely flavor This is a great latenight place with DJ playing eclectic music stays open until at least 2 am and crowd is diverse"

    "review":"I was attracted to this Chinese takeaway because it was part of justeatcouk  For the students amongst you youll recognize that this is an internetbased way of getting fast food fast Unfortunately being part of justeat doesnt mean its particularly goodI had sweet and sour chicken predictable I know and it was terrible Really gloopy and soggy batter and the chunks of vegetables were difficult to get around The rice was really dry and there was a mysterious meat mixed in itstill dont know what it was My friend had Chicken in Sataay and found it gloopy too she said it was really spicy which neither of us understood  its a peanut dish and she couldnt eat very much of it Furthermore it cost us 21 for the experience There are far better and far cheaper Chinese takeaways in EdinburghI went into Chinese Good Food Takeaway when I was in a rush one evening to grab my dinner and I probably wont go backI should probably have known the meal wouldnt be up to much when I saw the name  Chinese Good Food  perhaps not the most original of names the owners could have chosen The menu was a standard Chinese takeaway menu with a range of chicken beef and vegetarian dishes I had the beef with mushrooms dish which had a really thick sauce and the mushrooms were soggy and had sort of disintegrated into the dish The beef was really chewy and stringy  not nice As Chinese Good Food is situated in the really student orientated area of Bruntsfield I thought this place would be reasonably priced but my meal came to just under 10 My experience of Chinese Good Food was far from a treat and I next time I will go to the other cheaper and tastier Chinese takeaways in EdinburghYou know when your mother tells you if you have nothing good to say about a place you should probably say nothing at allOk Im gonna put myself out there as the only person who actually liked Chinese Good Food Takeaway When my girlfriend and I looked at the menu online we assumed that the portions must be very small since each dish was so cheap As a result we ordered 4 entrees and a starter When the food was delivered via Just Eat we were blown away by the massive pile of food in front of us I admit it wasnt exactly gourmet cooking but we enjoyed our selection of foods  Szechuan chicken cashew chicken some kind of amazing chicken wings yes we like chicken And it was decent chicken too not some questionably dry dark meat hunks duck chow mein and spring rolls CGFT is no destination for a fancy evening with the missus but more of the guilty pleasure food you order when hungover and dont want to change out of pajamas I will certainly be ordering from them again"

    "review":"The tearoom itself could use some work  its rather bare and sparsely laid out room for at least a handful more tables in there but I say mostly because they ought to to fit more people in there considering scrumptious this spread of tea goodies is The savories which in most places tend to be sad and lifeless with bland fillings were inventive and flavorful  a salmon wrap with cress an asian noodle salad balsamic eggplant bruschetta The sweets were equally delightful  fresh raspberry tart mini eclairs salted caramel popcorn panna cotta  candied orange ganache chocolate cake This is serious And on top of that two humongo raisin scones served with orangerosemary marmalade some kind of dark berry jam and a potful of clotted cream The cost comes to about 14 per person but we each got an extra pot of tea and I dont believe we were charged for it If I lived in Edinburgh you might find me here every afternoon its that scrumptiousA basement level space with friendly service and a tiny room to sit in in the back What really impressed me here was the quality of the food given it appears to be just a small cafe space We had a falafel sandwich with yoghurt and chilli jam as well as a sunblush tomato sandwich with Philadelphia and some other things In short the sandwiches were really really tasty and came with a small variety of their daily salad Also the millionaires shortbread was ridiculous I could feel a sugar headache coming on after half the bar but was totally worth itIn short: Great sandwiches decadent cakes good coffee  winnerFriends had visited here a few months ago for vegan afternoon tea and I couldnt make it  so this place has been on my go to list for ages They announced on their Facebook page that they would have vegan cakes and scones in the following day which happily coincided with a trip I had planned to Edinburgh They had one cinnamon scone left and my friend generously allowed me to have it  and she opted for the chocolate  peanut butter brownie They also had carrot cake available as well as a few nonvegan cake options I was happy it was a goodsized scone unfortunately  my photo isnt framed the best way to show it properly and came with dairyfree spread and two jams It was delicious and soft to the bite I also tried a sliver of the brownie and it was moist and sweet and also fantastic The toilet was well equipped with wipes and nappies should any mumsdadsguardians be visiting and in need of baby changing facilitiesI would definitely go back  the staff member owner said she was considering making Fridays a vegan cake day so wed know for sure theyd have cakes in for us and there have a savouries menu I didnt get a chance to investigate as we were just there for a quick visit  and a very specific cake pitstopReally delightful place for a sumptuous afternoon tea in the capital The decor is designed to recreate the living room of Angelina the titular matriarch who this lovely cafe is named after A super fun little trunk with fascinators pill box hats and fur stoles is just the cutest touch for getting into the vintage spirit The afternoon tea was genuinely faultless Delicious sandwiches cucumber with watercress butter filled Vietnamese pancakes avocado and chilli jam wraps and a selection of mouth watering and eye popping cakes We had egg nog and white chocolate eclairs boozy cherry pavlova fig cake with cream cheese icing and chocolate Swiss roll The scones were like clouds of baked majesty with 2 choices of home made jam and clotted cream This was all accompanied with Eteaket tea which for me is always on the moneyThe review is four stars as the service wasnt awesome the staff forgot to take our tea orders and I had to go look for someone and they seated a group beside us sharing a long table but we were left to rearrange where our afternoon was placed to make space for the new customers Id definitely return brilliant location with good parking nearby and near but just off the beaten track of the busy city centre BravoWhat a delightful little place and how full of wonderful tasty things it isA friend met us here for a spot of latelunch and a catch up he visits frequently owing to the good selection of glutenfree sandwiches and cakes such are his dietary needs He was not wrong I had a thick creamy and delicious hot chocolate along with a falafel and chilli jam wrap My wife had a brie and plum jelly sandwich which she correctly described as each sandwich half is the size of a normal sandwich So good Oh and the sandwiches came with a selection from all the different fresh and delicious salads of the day I think there were 5 or 6 including a fresh pear salad potato  tzatziki and couscous  aubergine All terrific I can safely say it was the best plate of vegetables I have tasted in a long timeWe paid a very fair price and enjoyed the cozy back room and on leaving my friend bought some lovely little cakes and biscuits It was a real treat in an area of town we visit often so will no doubt be back soon I cant wait to see what salads are there next timeLovely little place  Very chic lots of cake and a back room with a few seats   Perfect way to hide on an afternoon in the heart of the city and to grad a good catch up with a friend too"

    "review":"Not my favourite restaurant but it does the job and the food fills the space  Theres nothing particularly modern about this Chinese restaurant in fact theres nothing remotely modern about it  From the pink tablecloths to the folded fan napkins Wongs is a little bit stuck in the seventies decorwise and Id be surprised if the menu has seen a reboot since then either  However the food isnt bad and the price refelcts my initial judgment  stuck in the seventies but I certainly wont complain about thatWhat Wongs also offers is a Crunch Lunch 4 for 2 courses with a soft drink now you cant say fairer than that  And that price is dropped to 380 if you have a can instead of draught  Doesnt say much for the quality of the ingredients but nevermind were not here for qualityWongs is for you if youre hungry skint and have nowhere else to go  But still delivers a surprisingly satisfying experienceHad the Singapore spicy noodle and saltnspicy soft shell crab  The noodle was ok a bit on the bland side  The crab was tasty  It was soggy by the time it was delivered but I wonder if itd be crispier at the restaurant  Price was comparable to other Chinese restaurants at around GBP 79 per dish  Id give it an extra half stars for its super quick delivery"

    "review":"The food is decent quality but not worth the huge price tag You are better suited to find another thai restaurant I ordered a bowl of soup I thought it should be a very good bowl of soup because it was expensive I expected a decent portion as well and was very very disappointed IT WAS HARDLY A BOWL OF SOUP MORE LIKE HALF OF A VERY TINY CUP The other review for this place made mention that the fish cakes were 700 Ive been willing to shell out for very decent food in the past as well but when the portions that are served here are more like a diet suggestion for a 300 kilo fat cow I dont know whether to be offended or ripped off Every single item is way overpriced I dont know how they have managed to stay in business this long Dont be like the other sheep that poor through these doors just because they see a nice thai restaurant with high prices it doesnt mean its better quality food Go to Yak and Yeti restaurant instead where you pay just under 6 for a huge tray of food with a huge pile of rice or naan and several other dishes Just a suggestion as I was very impressed with the quality of restaurant the service the portions and the price there PASSORN SHAME ON YOU FOR RIPPING OFF PEOPLE YOU DISGUST ME YOUR SOUP ISNT WORTH THE PRICE TAG IM SURPRISED YOU DONT CHARGE JUST FOR LOOKING AT THE MENUA very nice place that obviously has a good reputation  Had to call to make a reservation after our walk up attempt was unsuccessful  The dinners of Pad Thai and Curry were excellent  We hadnt had Thai in a long time so we may be a bit skewed to approve but we really liked it  The place was very nice staff attentive  Only downside a bit priceyA friend and I walked by this place after seeing a film at the Cameo and decided to head in for dinner It was so cute and cosy with a nice ambiance and the staff was kind polite and super attentive from the moment we walked in We split the chicken satay and I had the chicken Pad Thai but it was all cooked to perfection with amazing flavours and beautiful presentation Portion sizes were perfect They have a rather extensive drinks menu and I got a very delicious cocktailA little pricey for Edinburgh but an absolutely wonderful and worthwhile experience Perfect for date night or as part of a nice evening outWent with a friend for a lunch date as we were craving Thai All in all it was a meh experience definitely not bad but mehMaybe Im spoiled but I found the food to be on the mild end It was definitely the right tastes but none of the flavors were quite nearly as strong as what I expect from Thai food The portions were also on the smaller sideI feel like we paid for a little more To top that off the music playing was Western like Southern US country music which really didnt go with the food The guy waiting on us was also doing literally just thatWAITING on us watching us it was a slightly uncomfortable experienceMy friend seemed to feel the same about the food and the place but it seems that the place is pretty popular by other reviews I just know that we went for spice and we didnt get muchAs a Yank who has just moved to Edinburgh I found myself sopping wet and in need of a cozy restaurant with an enticing menu  Like an angel as its name means in Thai Passorn is a beautiful little restaurant located in the Tollcross area on Brougham St just a wee bit north of the Meadows  While its cold grayandwhite exterior might not grab you in you should look past this and enter just as the saying goes about judging a book about its cover  My friend and I were warmly greeted by the ownermanager who even helped take our coats and hung them on the wall  Not something Id expect for lunchtime service but nonetheless welcomed  The restaurant consists of 2 main areas the front room is a bit smaller which fits about 3 tables and the barregister and the adjacent room which is a bit larger and tastefully decorated with silver and grey wallpaper  High ceilings and original  crown moulding details add to the ambience  There were a couple of diners already there when we came and as the lunch hour wore on there was a nice trickle of elderly locals and businessmenI ordered the lunch special which is a 3course meal which gives one the opportunity to choose from one item from their selection of appetizers main entrees and dessert ice cream or tea  795 pounds which seems to be the going rate for prefix lunch menus in the areaI went for the chicken balls which is 2 skewers chicken ball  green and red peppers on each served beautifully on a plate with a sweet siracha chili  pepper flake dip  The colors are bold the produce super fresh and the chicken was nicely grilled  Continuing on I had the pad chili dish which is a spicy dish consisting of chicken mushrooms onions peppers in a savory brown sauce scallions and a sculpted tower of white rice  Home run  I loved it even if it challenged my wellseasoned spicy pallet range  I would have loved to have more but then again Im from a country that is home of lumberjack helpings  For 90 pence you can get your afternoon tea served beautifully in white china and at least 3 cups full  The art of tea  yes indeed they have mastered and the service was attentive and courteous  Ill be back for sure with more friends and family and look forward to sampling the rest of their menuWhat a fantastic place This was my second visit and like the first it didnt disappoint Lets start with the food We decided to share some starters between the two of is and opted for the Thai spring rolls and the Golden taro fritters Both were beautifully presented decent portions and above all delicious Similar results for the main course I went for a chicken stir fry with black pepper ginger garlic and coriander while my partner went for the chicken chilli cashew stir fry Both dishes were beautiful exploding with taste but yet nothing overpowering Again portion sizes were perfect and we went for some coconut rice and noodles to accompany the mainsWe were quite full after all of this and decided to give the deserts a skipOccasionally I have seen the wine list at some Asian restaurants being underwhelming but passhorn got the perfect mix A perfect blend of new and old world while also being responsibly pricedThe service was good and attentive but maybe a tad bit rushed in the time between placing the order to getting the first course  the same between finishing the starter and receiving the main I like to relax and enjoy a meal so I probably should of let the waiter know up frontFood overall was faultless 5 stars  deducting one for feeling a bit rushed would be a bit harsh I am sure if I said something at the time it wouldnt of been an issueCant wait to return"

    "review":"Guru Shati is a pish takeaway that falsely advertises on Groupon to make a quick sale  This place sold Groupon vouchers on the pretence  that they deliver all over Edinburgh  Only when you go to order they wont deliver anywhere further than the end of their street  When phoning to complain not only did they not apologise but they said it was not their fault at all  Erm I think you will find Guru Shati that it is entirely your fault for not checking the Groupon before they were sold  Or maybe you really are just robbing bams who will do anything to make money Avoid this dumpGur Balti is an amazing Indian restaurant on Dundee Terrace which consistently offers delicious food and great service at reasonable prices  Ive been here twice with some friends and both times weve gone away more than satisfied with the whole experience  They pride themselves on serving some of the best Indian food in the city and each dish is presented immaculately  The menu has loads to choose from and the last time I was in I went for the Balti Chicken Passanda  It seemed to take no time to arrive and tasted creamy with a great range of flavours  All the meat which they use is of the highest quality and you can definitely taste the difference in all their meat dishesWe all spent no more than 15 each including drinks rice and tips and well hopefully be back sometime soonI have been to the Guru Balti a few times over several years It can be summed up as offering good quality meat and above average curry though the hotter dishes tend to lack that real zing of back end heat They have some of the best and biggest naan bread though their rice doesnt particularly stand outThe restaurant tends to be fairly quiet through the week making it a good choice for post cinema eating if you happen to be at the nearby Cineworld Guru is a good choice for an Indian meal and if you live in the area it should probably be your Indian restaurant of choiceGuru is right down the street from my flat for the summer and Ive passed it on many occasions without stopping in My mistake I adore Indian food and feel very lucky that this one is in my neighborhood I ordered takeaway and it was ready to go so quickly The portions are huge I got the vegetarian platter for 2 and we have enough leftovers for another full dinner tomorrow Their Benghan Bharta and Saag Paneer are very different than what I get in the San Francisco area but I love both styles The naan I ordered plain and garlic is amazing but I wish I had read previous reviews that mention how large they are The size is honestly impressive I have never seen naan that big in my life and the quality is great The samosas are really delicious too The highlight for me was the Guru chutney selection and the raita I love chutneys and I love raita and Guru does a fantastic job on both Ill be ordering from here againMy flatmates and I have tried various Indian takeaways but we always seem to back to the Guru because their food is simply amazing  Balti as good as it gets  And the naan breads are giantIt may not be the cheapest place for a takeaway but totally worth every pennyI have not eaten in the restaurant so cannot comment on the serviceIve had 2 takeaway meals from here on separate occasions and have enjoyed both Ive ordered online for collection and both times the service I received was excellent  friendly staff and timely receipt of food Ive had one chicken dish and one vegetarian dish accompanied by a naan The mains were packed with flavour not hot spice which Im too wussy for and were goodsized portions The naans however are another story altogether  ginormous I had the Peshwari Naan both times and was possibly the highlight of the meal especially as I had leftovers to accompany 2 more mealsGuru Balti also have a nicelooking sitin restaurant although both times I have visited to collect my takeaways it has been empty midweek evenings"

    "review":"Pricey but good overallI have to say coming from the US where Pizza Hut is considered low end on the pizzascale this is a nice departure from that The menu is a little more upscale and their service has always been good I opt for the Texas meat meltdown pizza when I come usually celebrating an academic win with a Pepsi I have never had an issue of any kind here The seating in front is good because you can people watch a bit while you eat The food is good but a tad pricey hence only coming to celebrate something the service is good and the location is great Overall I am pleased with this Pizza Hut and will likely be backBefore heading over to the Edinburgh Dungeon we decided to grab a quick bite over at Pizza Hut as it was nearby It was fairly busy at 4 in the afternoon We ventured out way to the salad bar where there were varieties of pre made salads toppings such as bacon crumbs corn as well as a few pasta salads and some dressing I liked the one pasta salad with tomato sauce as it was zesty We got one pizza to share with the cheesy bites crust half of it being the Cajun Chicken Sizzler and the other Blazin Inferno Both varieties were fairly good the Blazin Inferno being as hot and spicy as advertised The pizza arrived piping hot too which was a plus The service was a hit or a miss but it was understood especially due to the fact that they were pretty busy and with lots of kids running around The washrooms however were not clean at all and before entering you could already smell itSo we decided to go to Pizza Hut for a spot of lunch the other day on a budget and in a bit of a rush the 699 all you can eat pizza and pasta buffet sounded pretty good GBot only had an hour for his lunch but we figured that Pizza Hut would probably be the quickest option due to its convenient location Oh boy how wrong we wereAs soon as we walked in we realised it was chocablock but with such a short space of time we didnt really want to head anywhere else as at lunchtime everywhere is busy in this area We stood at the door in a short queue and waited to be finished We waited to five minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were standing there waiting All of the staff seemed to be doing nothing in particular all just aimlessly walking around doing their own thing making to contact with any customers or doing anything worthwhile After around 15 minutes we were finally sat down and told to wait to get our order taken We waited five minutes and nobody came so seeing as we just wanted to buffet we decided just to go up we couldnt sit there forever and we were starving I grabbed a plate and stuffed as much salad as I could on it and I got a few slices of pizza but there was hardly anything left and we were told to come back in a couple of minutes till they got a new batch out While we were sitting eating the small couple of slices wed managed to grab a waitress came up to us and asked us if we were ready to order HELLO We are sitting eating here are you blind This is probably the most bizarre question Ive ever been asked in a caferestaurantdineranywhere reallyThe pizza was pretty tasteless to be honest and the potato salad that I got seemed to be garnished with a water dressing that tasted like absolutely nothing and the cucumbers were cut about 4 inches thickOh another thing for some reason the napkins were cellotaped around the cutlery so when you took the tape off it ripped the napkin It appears that the idiots really are running the asylum at this branch of Pizza Hut This was levels of incompetence Ive never experienced anywhere I realised it was busy but seriously these were schoolboy errors This lunchtime experience was a disaster I realise its Pizza Hut buffet and its cheap and its simple food but the service and the food was appalling and I wont be hurrying backI stopped by because the lunch buffet is a good deal for just 7  The problem is that everyone else wants in too and this place isnt that big  The queue can be enormous with no real place to wait  Also I stood in line for at least 10 minutes before anyone even so much as looked in the direction of where I was standing  Cramped and crowded poor service I can see the only reason to come here is to gorge your self on the buffet and vegetate in the streets while it digestsIf youre not planning on eating a lot or hate long queues avoid this place like the plagueSeated straight away served very quickly and food came in a reasonable time Staff friendly good doNot somewhere that Id usually choose to go for lunch but my 6 year old second cousin is super fussy and wanted to go here for as they had Pan the movie posters in the window rather than one of the other nearby other pizza options I was pleasantly surprised at the experienceUnexpectedly they do gluten free pizzas that dont taste like they are and almost all the toppings are gluten free so quite a big choice for one of our group who was expecting to eat just salad The salad bar is now free with the lunch buffet or with any main meal its exactly the same as when I was a teenager and I quite enjoyed eating croutons with thousand island dressing again  As it was busy the pizza on the buffet was very fresh and there was a good selection of toppings For a quick lunch with a small person Id defiantly come back"

    "review":"I had lunch at Apiary two days in a row even though its across town from me so that should tell you somethingLove the restaurant setting its lovely to sit in a booth by the window with the sun streaming inTried quite a few things on the new spring menu loved the boudin noir Im assured the lamb tostada is also fantastic The duck confit had a perfectly crunchy skin and beautifully cooked meat underneath paired well with greens  buckwheat noodles and a star anise sauce The peanut butter  jam ice cream with the rocky road is a taste sensation and the mess is delicious for those with a sweet toothA few other things still need a bit of tweaking but overall the menu is shaping up to be fantastic The evening menu looks great as well and I look forward to heading back and trying it outService is very relaxed and friendly although at times could have been slightly more attentiveThe Apiary is absolutely lovely and it feels like you are stepping into a world of charm and decadence I first came two weeks ago with a group of eager Yelpers and I was like Cressi absolutely entranced by the place The decor is beautiful and the place is charming and elegant but also feels like it is romantic yet unpretentious When I first came I ordered a vegetarian for my main that was served over couscous Having traveled in Morocco two years ago my expectations for an authentic tajine were quite high but I was a bit disappointed by it since it was underwhelming compared to my neighbours 3Bees Bird and Beasts sharing platter  it was absolutely massive and astounding The quality of the meat was also superb my manly friends were kind enough to share a bourbon glazed rib with me which says a lot but then again they were so stuffed with the massive platter that by the end they seemed a bit relieved to share with me although they didnt want to let on about that On to dessert  I had the chocolate brioche bread pudding with chocolate ice cream and it was really tasty I ordered well that time roundTonight I came back with a friend and it was busy and bustling since it was the second day of their new menu and they were offering 50 off food in exchange for feedback  I was more than happy to help Caz and Claire had been yesterday for lunch and raved about it and Caz even returned a second day in a row for lunch so they had tried many options and gave me many helpful suggestions The dinner menu was quite different from the one they had sent me photos of but I also thought it had much better options I was torn and had to keep asking the friendly server for her recommendations which were spot on I had the 3bee boudin noir salad with honey roast sweet potato grapefruit soused tomato and roasted red onion The richness of the black pudding was complemented perfectly by the sweet and fruity other components of the salad making it divine My friend had a vegetarian salad with lovely field mushroomsFor our mains my veggie companion had couscous and feta fritters which seemed quite innovative and she said they were delicious I had the coriander chili and lager braised lamb shoulder which was well done but succulent and cooked to perfection We also shared the fries that came in a little bag  they were tasty skinny fries that were along the lines of McDonalds French fries not a bad thing in this case but much better They also came in a rustic paper bagFor dessert my friend had the banana honey and custard mess which she felt was much too sweet I had the rocky road with marshmallows shortbread Turkish delight and chocolate over peanut butter and strawberry jam ice cream I was a bit put off by the idea of PBJ ice cream thinking that one or the other would be ok but not together in ice cream although they do work in the classic sandwich of my childhood but the enthusiastic server convinced me easily to try it It was amazing It was really peanut butter ice cream with a few little swirls of jam and the rocky road and shortbread was fantastic although if truth be told the pieces could have been a tad smaller and more bitesizedAll in all it was a fabulous evening The ambiance was perfect and beautiful with the candles on the tables The staff were all helpful friendly and enthusiastic The wine was fantastic Last but but least the food was absolutely deliciousAs the sister restaurant to the well reviewed Three Birds restaurant in Morningside I was eager to try this place outWe needed somewhere to eat before an event at Summerhall and this place was perfect situated just around the corner on the main road The interior is very relaxed with more of a cafe feel than a restaurant We were seated in one of the cute little booths They offer an excellent pretheatre menu of two courses for 15 if you are out by 715pm I chose the squid to start and gnocchi for main Steven had the Vietnamese beef salad followed by the venison The staff are very warm friendly and relaxed With the atmosphere and a bottle of red we were quickly content with our surroundings The food arrived quickly and beautifully presented Not fussy but fresh and vibrant Their menu is glutenfree unless stated otherwise so the food feels wholesome and healthy With the starters quicky devoured our mains arrived A fantastic helping of homemade gnocchi that had been finished in a pan so it was nice and crispy Its the best Ive ever had Steven venison looked beautiful and came with a fantastic red wine sauce All in all a fantastic dinner for 30 each They are also open for brunch which I cant wait to try Cheers AmyFab gluten free options and great nonstandard vegetarian options Being GF can be a challenge and having to do the whole asking thing and then it being clear that staff dont have a clue what you are talking about then makes the whole thing a bit awkward and full of trepidation in case they got it wrong and you suffer the consequences laterNot here Most of the menu is naturally gluten free  no cheap wheat fillers here clearly Good quality ingredients and lots of choice I could have crispy stuff normally off limits I could have chips without fear of contamination The Apiary rocks and Im heading back in a few days with a friend who missed outBeware though The whole menu is so damn tempting  from little bites the starters the mains and the desserts Portions are on the hearty side for mains so I was full to bursting after dinner here Crispy pigs ears were delish with aioli as were the whitebait starters I opted for one of the specials  guinea fowl wrapped in pancetta with duck confit and sage and shallot mash  it was lovely but even I was defeated in not being able to clear the plate Plus I had seen the dessert options and I wanted to test them outDessert was a coconut sponge with lime and Malibu  it was delish I never did the whole Malibu thing as a teenager but all the flavours worked out so wellEveryone appeared to love their food and there were lots of head nods and smiles as we chowed downSo I still think Newington rocks as an eating area and The Apiary is a great addition It is cosy without being cramped and there are some lovely touches  little booths with coat hooks on the side gorgeous prints and dcor and just a lovely warm buzzy feeling So Im heading back in a few days and I plan on taking my next lot of visitors here too :Prices  bites around 250 bread is cheaper and GF is available too starters around 5 with mains around 1017 and desserts around 6 Wine  starts from 350 a glass with carafe options 8 and a decent price range for bottlesThe Apiary seem to take the job of feeding me very seriously and I appreciate this greatlyBrought to us by the same people as The Three Birds the Apiary is bringing some foodie goodness to Newington Not an area beset with many great eateries they certainly stand out in the areaOn a coldish winters eve I was pleased to find myself in their warm and comforting surroundings the wood finish around the place gives a very nice feel to the placeHaving been to the Three Birds I had high expectations for this meal and I wasnt left disappointed Having surveyed the menu I concluded having two rounds of starters was completely acceptableStarter 1 was crispy pigs earsyes thats right pigs ears the crispy salty porky delights were really tasty served with the house aioli I was happyStarter 2 I went for white bait Fishy saltycrispy and tastyHappy JDFor my main I went for one of the sharing boards with fellow carnivore DaveM this beat came with beef ribs pork ribs and chicken wings along side slaw chips and the obligatory side salad Fair to say we destroyed itMEATAll of it was deliciousit was fairly nutritious and all in all I was a very happy JDThis place comes Highly Jd RecommendedThe fam decided to take advantage of Apiarys pretheatre menu two courses for 15 Headed down around 5:30 we were the only ones in the restaurant for a while but that was fine It filled up later Absolutely LOVE the staff love the lights love the bee themeUnfortunately my food fell short I chose to go with the butternut squash stack as an entre and the ice cream sandwich for dessert The stack was a limp tomato slice sandwiched between two thin rounds of squash There was spinach somewhere in there too I wouldve loved for the squash to have a crispier exterior everything ultimately mushed together Heaping portion of couscous with little flavor except the occasional slice of chile Big pile of raw undressed greens  was this supposed to be a garnish I did enjoy the cold nutty sauce spooned over some of the couscous It had a unique flavor and its cool temperature was refreshing Also appreciated the gorgonzola Delicious pbj ice cream Blue cheese ice cream was weird as HELL but had outstanding flavor I dont understand the choice of nougatfilled wafer cookies for the sandwich Theyre flavorless and dont complement ice cream I wouldve much preferred some sort of soft cookie that soaked up the ice cream as it started to melt Other food notes: the special cheesy crisped polenta was great Smoked pigeon starter was also tasty but figs are out of season"

    "review":"Nandos is Nandos is NandosIll admit it I like Nandos for what it is Its a chain so you know the quality before you choose and if Im honest the quality for spitroasted chicken or however they do it is pretty good for a fancy lunch or cheap and cheerful dinner Except its not that cheap 10 for half a roast chickenWhy do I come to Nandos Because they do a lot of chicken and a lot of spice And I like chicken and spice Usually theyre located beside cinemas or in leisure parks like up at Fountain Bridge or in Xscape in Glasgow And they are the perfect precinema or postrock climbing lunch option And lunch is usually what I go here forIt has the feel of fastfood but its far better quality and Id wager much better for you than any other fast food placeHowever this one is sitting right beside a few other restaurants that are favourites of mine As in favourites in the whole of Edinburgh So when it comes to dinner time I definitely know Ill be choosing them over NandosAlso I looked at the opening hours on the website and unless its wrong they only open till 5pm So that means they really are only a lunch place HmmNandos really is aok Its not good dining its not bad Its great for families with kids where the parents want something better than waffles beans and eggs but can take the kids without any worry youll upset other customers with noisy exciteable children smooshing fries into their face literally INTO their face And its good for big groups I can imagine given the area itll get busy with school kids tooaw i feel a bit bad that this nandos seems to have gotten some mediocre reviews  i for one LOVE some nandos  and this place was perfect when the boyfriend and i were looking for a lateish night bite to eat  it was coming up to 10pm on a saturday night and we both were starving for dinner  i was hoping something would be open along george vi bridge and lo and behold the welcoming lights of Nandos  we entered and i was surprised that for 10pm this place was fairly busy  however we were shown to a seat quickly and the waiter confirmed that we knew how the ordering system etc workedat this point i dont even bother to look at the menu as i always order the same thing and i can confirm that the halluomi and portabello pita was just as good as it always is  in fact it was probably better than usual as i was a bit tipsy and starving  the coleslaw was tasty and the chips freshly made  so all in all a really good meal for less than a tenner  the boyfriend was equally happy with his chicken wrapi felt that the service was quick and attentive and honestly i cant think of anything negative to say  especially as this place was still seating people when we left closer to 11pm  yay for a proper late night meal :Nandos was by far my favorite chain restaurant in Europe The butterfly burger was amazing as I had one in the London Dublin and Edinburgh location A must have if visitingNandos was constantly been one of my favorite chain restaurants with great food The first times I visited this particular location I found the food portions a bit smaller than other restaurants but I found that this has been improved The restaurant has a nice ambience and is conveniently located I would normally give them 4 but Nandos no longer holds the student discount they used to haveCall me a food snob but whenever I overhear people making a big fuss over Nandos I feel a little twinge of pity for them They clearly havent had the opportunity to explore the range of truly tasty restaurants we have in the cityIve tried to like Nandos Ive even given it a few chances to win me over but the overwhelming response each time is meh Its chicken and chips My gran knocks that together most Sundays and doesnt charge a hefty mark upThe chicken isnt even particularly moist in fact its more often than not grilled to within an inch of its life The chips if the internet is to be believed are supplied by McCain based on my visits I wouldnt dispute that If youre excited to see halloumi on the menu dont be as youll only be served a few teeny slivers Its all just a bit mediocre Bland soulless food disguised by a heavy slathering of periperi spice andor sauce  the trojan horse theyve used to build the brandMy top tip for eating at Nandos is dont bother Chicken McCains hummus halloumi and even their own sauces are widely available in supermarkets these days Stay in do a better job of the cooking yourself and save your hard earned cash for somewhere with a bit more oomphI was SO excited to go to Nandos as Id been years ago and had very fond memories  I have to say though I was sorely disappointed  Although I have to say I think it is a great idea how you choose your filling type of meal eg pita bread bun etc and also the spiceyness of the sauce  the lemon and mango numbers are great for those would like flavour but cant stand hot and spicey  However I just thought that for what you got a glorified burger basically that it is well overpriced  When I went I ordered two main meals plus two drinks and I barely got a few pennies in change from 30  Now the way I look at it is for this price I could have gone to a pretty decent restaurant and would have enjoyed spending that amount of money there rather than giving it to a place that is just a step up from McDonalds  In fact considering I can buy a meal for two for less than a tenner in McDonalds I think I prefer it to Nandos  Dont get me wrong the food was good but so is a Big Mac from time to time so in the end it was just an expensive burger and Ive had better  Im sad to say my Nandos bubble was well and truly burst"

    "review":"Excellent meal and great value The chef switched out an item for us on the appetizers as well DeliciousAnita A and I scored a Groupon voucher to have a 3 course meal at Credo Restaurant in Leith Just opened about 3 weeks ago on Queen Charlotte Street is Credo A family owned restaurant introducing a semi fine dining experience for the Edinburgh dining crowd The dining area is set up on 3 levels Light wood chrome and glass dividers It has a classy upmarket feel about itWe were warmly greeted by the owner Simon who lead us to our table on the middle level We noticed a big mural of a stag and tree which was truly suited to the place The bare tables were minimally decorated with a candle side plate napkin and starter cutlery The menu works as follows: Starters are served as MAT Mezze Antipasti  Tapas which is a daily variety of locally sourced and home made tasting sharing plate We requested to have the fish and meat starters to be served up in separate servings which was no problem  So Anita had whitebait and salmon en croute I was served goats cheese on croutons oat cakes and chicken liver pate All quite nicely presented I was wanting a little more flavour but I usually do anyway Mains: Anita had pan seared Pollock and Thai style coconut sauce Shell comment on that in her review as I didnt taste it I ordered the Pork Belly with Colcannon leek mint pea and carrots This came out very promising Big square piece of pork belly and the top part looked glazed and crispy  Looked as when I was trying to cut through it it was rock hard on the edges and leather inwards Shame as that was the bit that I was actually looking forward to eating The pork itself was thoroughly cooked though a little dry and as the skin wasnt slashed to allow crisping thus me missing out on the flavour  I asked for some gravy to offset the dryness and missing flavour I did advise the owner Ruth she was apologetic she was to inform the chef and offered to replace the dish I declined that as I did eat the potatoes and most of the pork already  side note: the dishes were all a little missing in flavour so salt  pepper on the table would have helped a little The dessert is served in the same ish style as the starter The daily available dessert offering mixed on a plate  Mille Feuille Chocolate Souffle Fondant Kiwi  Lemon Creme Anglais Raspberry Ripple Ice CreamThis should have been the saviour of the meal  however The Mille Feuille was presented as a single bottom layer with cream on topThe Creme Anglais was served in an edible mini tortepie case looking like a custard pie which we thought it was until we tried it and it oozed over the plate unable to be poured Souffle is a difficult dish and it was a shame it was sunk  so it couldve been a fondant  either way it was a not rich or chocolaty enough for our taste We were given the drinks off the bill as we had mentioned the issues we had with the dishes In all quite a shaky start theyve got the right intentions and obviously the chef is trying to get it right but not just yet at this point The staff are very pleasant and helpful a special mention needs to go to Morgana: hello againThe management couple Ruth Muir and Simon Hill are on a right track but several refinements will need to be made soon It is a great venue and with the right servings this could mean the difference between a fine place to have a nice dinner or a nice place to fine dine in I want to stress that theyve just opened doors and they are really working very hard to make this work I am sure I will visit them again on a later occaision possibly to try out the brunch with some Yelpers as I like this new venture to work as it is slightly different from what is out there in LeithOnce upon a time this place was literally the worst tapas bar in EdinburghThankfully however it is now a gorgeous wee restaurant Credo offers a very sultry atmosphere low lights and groovy stuff painted on the walls adorned with fairy lightsWe were all sat for their 3 course deal Our waiter was a little overwhelmed by our party of 14 which is probably fair He spent a lot of time telling us about everything on the starter platter as well as the desert platter later and Ill admit to not being the most thorough yelper and I little of bothThe starting platter had 2 fishy things which i didnt eat a chick terrine i wasnt blown away by they dont really do it for me and a zesty little chickpea thing General consensus of the people near me was that it was all nice but no one seemed amazed by itThe mains pretty much all sounded super tasty I ended up having the guinea fowl and mash It was absolutely delicious but too small for a man of my appetite I was jealously eyeing up my neighbours pork loin I think if youre a hungry person get some sides or order the steak Everyone made a lot of appreciative noises for this courseThe desert platter was nothing short of delightful Again I can only hang my head in shame at not really remembering any of the dishes on the platter but believe me everyone loved it There was a white chocolate thing a pineapple cheesecake something biscuity flavoured but creamy in texture and another thing that was also super yummy gods this is a shocking reviewAll in all I think its a lovely spot Id definitely recommend it as a bit of an off the beaten track date spot their bar is pretty decent for a restaurant"

    "review":"If youve ever been to one of this chains establishments before then you know what to expect What sets this branch apart is the excellent views of Edinburgh castle and Princes Street that it enjoys  factors that may soon see it become a bigger earner than the branch in Harvey Nichols which is pretty much stuck in the dark on the top floor The staffs obvious enjoyment at working here is another plus pointWhilst there are none of the drink robots that the chains original Rose Street site had many years ago the staff make up for that by being keen and attentive to your needs which is what the 4th stars for Foodwise theyve added a few new items since I was last in a Yo outlet and the prices dont seem to have risen much if at all no doubt theyre still cheaper than their concession at Edinburgh airport but if you want good value for money there are better sushi restaurants elsewhere in the city The option to sit all day and have unlimited miso soup is still a possibility thoughIts a fun and centrally located place to go for your first try of sushi or as a good and healthy option for some elevated people watching but once youve a taste for the food you should branch out and see what else Edinburgh has to offer in that regardIm fairly new to sushi having only been convinced to give it a go whilst my brother came to visit me Trying to keep exploring this delicious food we decided to meet some friends at Yo Sushi To say I was disappointed would be an understatement The katsu curry was delicious but everything else was an overpriced letdown After being spoilt by 3150 plates of deliciousness in Sydney this was a rude awakening and my first experience of overpriced sushiNothing spectacular as with chain sushi places but MUCH better than bonsai on broughton street  I specified I had a shrimp allergy and still had my sushi contaminateI enjoyed the food at Yo even if it wasnt quite authentic Japanese food and definitely Europeanized  I ordered the salmon plate spicy seafood udon and strawberry cheesecake mochi bitesI commend the restaurant on being very clean while its modern design was such a comfortable dining environment  Having watersparkling water available to be self poured from a faucet at each table was really neat tooHowever the service was not great at all and the portions are very small for what you pay  My meal was 3040 pounds and I only ate 4 dishes YikesAlso their take out menu is horrible with only a handful options  I would dine elsewhere after trying itToday we popped into the capital for the a look around Came in for like lunch Living in Sydney we are a bit spoiled for choice  of sushi So wasnt sure if this would be any good No Japanese sushi chefs on display But it was actually pretty good and the choice was good also Was it best Japanese food Ive had No Was it close No Would I come back Yes There was nothing wrong with it Its decent enough Havent paid the bill yet thoughFinally Edinburgh has a proper branch of Yo No more cramming in to a tiny space on the top floor of Harvey NicksBeing slap bang in the middle of Princes Street Im sure this branch will prove popular if just for convenience It follows the tried and tested Yo formula  sushi and other assorted bites on colour coded plates whizzing past you on a conveyor belt Its nice to sit by the bar and gawp at the talent of the sushi chefs seriously how good must their knife skills be to slice fish that precisely but in this branch it would be worth napping a booth in the window and enjoying the view of the castle gardens and shoppers belowStaff fairly friendly and hopefully this wont wear off with time and nothing to fault it Ill definitely be back"

    "review":"Doctors is on the corner of Forrest Road opposite Middle Meadow Walk It used to be the main meeting point for medical students hence the name and still bears some of the evidence with a cabinet marked with chemical symbols at the back It is fairly traditionally styled my friend calls it an old man pub and always serves 3 or 4 local beers which change on a regular basis As well as beers there is also everything else you would expect lagers alcopops and spirits These are typically priced for the area with a pint costing somewhere between 3 and 370 Tenants is cheap Staropramen a little more expensive Food is also served and is what you would expect of a pub meal it is not freshly prepared but its not bad either There are meal deals you can get 2 mains for 10 and there are specials written on a board behind the bar It also shows football and rugby matches on various screens positioned around the place and also on a larger projection if a popular match is on Doctors is a nice bar its main attraction is its selection of real beer as well as its busy but relaxed atmosphere The medicine on sale may be the overthecounter stuff nowadays but I find its pretty effectiveThis is our first visit to Edinburgh Cool looking place It was a nice day and there seemed to be a lot of happy pubogers enjoying themselves so we stopped in for a beer  After walking around the meadows and sightseeing this really hit the spot Friendly people and lively atmosphereThis pub holds a special place in my heart since this is where my classmates and I always went to get a drink after class  But objectively there isnt much special about  In fact it is downright standardDoctors isnt is a pub I would want to spend an entire evening in however it is a decent chain same group as Milnes or Beehive pub It feels a little soulless trying too hard to emulate a traditional pub and it is fairly popular with the student population so it can be busyHowever dont discount it its a good starting location with filling pub grub provided by Taylor Walker along with a normally decent selection of real ale The one thing I always find slightly amusing is they stock Carling and Tennents both fairly generic lagersIn the end though accept Doctors at face value and enjoy your food and a quick drinkFriendly staff who were happy to indulge my friend in a couple of free samples of ales she was interested in so that was a good start Overall the bar is just a bar which is a good thing with sports on some screens a couple of guys playing folk music and your usual standard of pub foodWhat I disliked though was the fact that it was over 12 for three simple gin and tonics Bear in mind this is a straight forward pub and not some style bar in George St In similar bars in the area you can get the same drinks for a fraction of the price And yes whilst it is populated by students its quite obvious the students who drink here are not short of a few quid and you certainly need a few quid if you plan to stay hereWe stumbled upon this place upon arriving in edinburgh the cheap food prices called to us  We were very pleasantly surprised by the food: it was the first time in scotland that we felt like we got our moneys worth and then some  The ultimate burger cost 5 pounds for  12 ounce behemoth of a burger I shared one with a friend and we were both full after eating half of it  The chili was also very good as well as the nachos  The proportions were always nice and big  We ended up coming back two more times in the three days we stayed in edinburghThe beers are reasonably priced not the cheapest but not expensive about 3 pounds for a pintThe pub has a nice decor and feels quite cozy  Beware the burger night though on wednesdays  we had to wait quite a while to get a table"

    "review":"Silver Bowl are a chain of Cantonese take aways on the east end of Edinburgh that have seemed to pop out of nowhere in the last few years I had passed two branchs the 3rd seems to be a fabrication I still cant find it several times and decided to give it a try during a late night editing sessionI tried calling a few times but I couldnt get through So we decided to chance our luck on the online ordering service Around 20 minutes later the food was at the door I wondered how many people he killed speeding to get over here this quicklyI popped open my Char Siu and had a taste In couldnt believe how fresh it tasted The pork was well fired but not burned and  surprisingly the black pepper sauce that accompanied tasted brilliantThe whole order came to about 6 delivery was only 1  but I would gladly pay double for food this tastyI was babysitting a friend after a root canal on the WestEnd when we decided that instead of going out to see Heartbreaker I had to sit her down and make her watch the trailer so that shed understand it just wasnt worth it wed order in and watch But Im a Cheerleader and Ghost World Which was a much better option We ordered a portion of scallops in black bean sauce and king prawns with ginger and spring onions My favourite was definitely the portion of king prawns though I was highly disappointed in the definite lack of prawns I mean there may have been about 10 prawns in the whole meal For three of us Three seafood lovers The scallops in black bean sauce were also few and far between The sauces were very good indeed though I would definitely urge them to be more generous with their seafood The service on the other hand was prompt and it was the first time Id ever ordered anything off the internet So I was surprised itd actually arrived at all Each of our portions cost just above a fiver So I guess its pretty moderate for a takeaway though Im certain Ive eaten better and cheaperI got a chicken sweetcorn soup on my way home last night and rice paper prawns and was absolutely appalled by both    The chicken sweetcorn soup used to be fantastic in the past flavoursome and really good tasty bits of chunky chicken pieces  but the soup I had last night was just vile   23 scraggly bits of chicken the congealed soup had no flavour other than  fatty chicken skin it was disgusting to say the least     And the rice paper prawns were equally disappointing by the time I got home I found the tiny little things were swimming in oil in its foil container    Again in the past the rice paper prawns were great but now theyre absolutely tiny and not worth the moneyThe Silver Bowl used to be one of the best chinese take aways in Leith many years ago and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it but Ive noticed their standards have declined quite substantially over the years    Their food isnt cheap and for the price I would not expect anything to be so gross  theres no excuse  I certainly wont be going back and I definitely wont be recommending it any furtherRing in the new year Bring out the Thai Take Away from Silver Bowl On our day of post NYE celebrations ie tired lethargic lustless it was decided that we let some other do the cooking Unfortunately our normal Thai place was closed on this day Alternatives were needed We found an old takeaway menu and we logged in online to see if anything had changed It was still the same We ordered for delivery at 5 online however it came to our attention only later when we called that only open at 5 but they already started on our dishes And sure enough those arrived 20 min later My personal favourite is the Tom Yum  this time with Gai chicken It was so packed with flavours and proper ingredients I could have had 3 more and called it a meal My other dish was a spicy chili beef and cashew side order of beansprout soft noodles I was less impressed with this dish I contribute this to the Tom Yum I had only finished minutes before It was tasty but not as flavour or spice packed I wanted it to be  Oh well nothing that cannot be saved with some chili oil and white pepper In all they are now firmly in my top 3 for ordering Take AwayWhat do you call those days in between Christmas and New Year Is there a name for them Whatever theyre called I doubt anyone can really be bothered cooking and so the hunt for an excellent takeaway is onNow it probably says something about how good Silver Bowl is that my sister ate from here two nights in a row  The second night my boyfriend and I joined in on her recommendation  Unsure of what to have partly caused by my reluctance to order Green Curry I make this all the time at home meant we ended up playing it safe and choosing to share some Pad Thai and Green Curry between the two of us with my sister going for the prawn Pad  And we threw in a starter platter tooThe food took about an hour to arrive longer than wed have liked but not so long to warrant a complaint  When it arrived we were delighted by the very generous portions  So big were they that we couldnt finish  The Green Curry was delicious although bear in mind it is also fairly hot  The Pad Thai was huge  And really tasty  But I was so full from eating the curry wed ordered rice to accompany as was my boyfriend that Im afraid we ended up wasting about 13 of it  I reckon you could easily share it throw in a starter and be satisfiedOur order  starter selection prawn Pad Thai chicken Pad Thai chicken Green Curry rice and garlic noodles  came to just over 40 so really very reasonableI can see us ordering from here againIve never been too into thai food  until I discovered this place The online ordering system is simple and they have the food ready in good time A few times now I just walked into the place on Leith Walk ordered at the counter and left with fresh hot amazing smelling foodThe Pad Kee Mao Mu has become my go to order Delicious rice noodles packed with veggies and a good serving of pork  an overall very generous serving size at that Fantastic value for money My partner has had their veggie Pad Thai a few times now and seemed happy with that as wellDesert wise their sticky coconut rice with mango is to die for and I might have a slight addiction problem there now Its especially good cold out of the fridge the next day"

    "review":"Really amazing place We went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed With just one table left we were sat down and got the menus Everything on the menu is Greekthemed and we chose a Greek breakfast and Greek sausages and eggs The girl serving us didnt seem phased at all by how busy it was and took our order quickly We got our coffees and meals quickly as well especially for how busy it was The food was really tasty seasoned to perfection My dish had a bit too much oil on it for my preference but thats just trying to find something a little bit negative The bread that was served with my dish was supertasty and I really tried to eat everythingWe had to go get some money out before we left because they dont take card but there is a cash machine just down the road on Nicholson streetGreat place will definitely come again :Its that time again Festival season Which means you and your hungry tummy may be a bit hardpressed to find a seat in a pub or cafe or restaurant or really anywhere in Edinburgh The hubs and I had already struck out in our search for a prefringe bite to eat in a joint down the road We spotted Richmond Cafe intriguingly close enough to the Pleasance Cabaret where our later event awaited When we spotted some seating available outside every nook and cranny was occupied inside we decided to take our chancesAnd glad I am that we did Richmond was a lovely wee experience It features mainly Greek and Mediterranean food which is right up our alley The service was good and the food appeared very promptly: hubs got a slab of fried feta cheese and a spinach pie both of which were nomtastic My tastebuds exploded with a big ol Greek sandwich that was swimming in yogurt sauce and deliciousness Man It was incredibly messy but worth the amount of time I spent cleaning off my hands after : We polished all that off with a robust Greek coffee some tea and a strawberry tart All deliciousThe only real downside for us was our expectation to receive a cafesized billIve been told since by a regular of the place that they do offer a much pricier Festival menu which explains the amount we shelled out at the end Certainly more than you would expect from a cafe but at the same timethe food was delicious and I certainly dont mind paying a little extra for good service and environment Not only that but despite their hours listing 7 PM as their closing hour they are obviously keeping the place open after hours to welcome the fringe crowd All in all Ill definitely be back to the Richmond Cafe to sample more of their delicious foodbut probably once the festival is overHow come I didnt know this place before It was so close to where I liveI was recommended by a Greek friend and a localone of them said that he once had lunch here for almost one month Then I thought I should give it a try I went there with my friend for brunch and ordered the spinach and feta cheese pie with Greek yogurt IT WAS AMAZING The portion was enough for brunch and the Greek yogurt suit very well with the pie The atmosphere there was quite nice too with the sunshine and the view of Salisbury Crag You know that it was not always easy to find a good place to eat in the UK but this one was exactly the bistro I would definitely come again and recommend it to my friendsSince my first review of Richmond Cafe after a popin during the Fringe Festival the ol boy and I managed another visit a few nights ago and left feeling just chuffed to bits The food was just as delicious as the first time the service was genuine and friendly and the bill certainly felt cheaper than it had been during the hubbub of the festival Not only that but when we arrived at just at 6 pm I worried wed have enough time to eat before their Yelpreported closing time at 7 No need to worry there on this particular night as more people and what appeared to be some Greek friends and family arrived well after us all served with a smile and set up with coffees for the adults and adorable wee hot cocoas for the chillins It made for such a lovely atmosphere full of good food and camaraderie My only wish is that they added a few more veg options to the menubut seeing as many of the starters are big and delicious enough in combo even that isnt a real issue Will totally be back to the RichmondIve visited this Greek Mediterranean cafebistro place three times so far and I have nothing but good feedback for them Being a Greek I enjoyed the Greek dishes in the menu including baklava but also main dishes with pork lamb and starters as well like tzatziki yoghurt garlic and cucumber with some herbs Another favourite is mpougatsa: filo pastry with a sweet cream made from milk semolina sugar lemon flavour with sprinkled icing sugar and cinnamon on top Very popular in Northern Greece ThessalonikiSometimes on a Sunday there might be a live Greek music event The service is very friendly and quick I loved their spinach pie which they can kindly warm up for you if you prefer it hot The coffee was good they make also some nonstandard ones which are popular in Greece: give a try the Freddo one  If youre up for an alcoholic drink they have a stronger version of ouzo called tsipouro from Tirnavos an area  popular in Greece for producing the best quality of this drink Looking forward to my next visit Keep up the good work guys"

    "review":"Had a hectic morningJust woken upHellers Kitchen is the perfect place to go to unwind with lunch  and maybe even a cheeky lunch time drink from the small bar while soaking up the relaxed and buzzing atmosphereFood has a distinctly homemade feel and flavour to it  the stone baked pizzas are particulary good But of course you could just skip the social convention of mains first and dive right into the deserts  each of which are made in the kitchen and unbelievably tasty Hellers Kitchen is arguably away from the hubbub of the city centre  but thats not what Hellers Kitchen is for  it is about getting away from it allWent here while visiting  the breakfast was good I had the American style pancakes and my wife the eggs benedict  both were nice Its got a nice relaxed atmosphere but still nicer than a greasy spoon type of place The coffee was also the best we had in Edinburgh Service was attentive and friendly Prices were also reasonableWe had a party of 11 there for dinner a few nights ago and everyone loved it  Terrific mussels scallops  fish nice beer list and wonderful service  We made a reservation a couple of days before and they were all ready for us  no waiting  And they got us out in time for a showI have to admit what drew me into this place was their window display of yummy cupcakes in the window And they werent just pretty they were yummy too Didnt try their food but it certainly smelled yummy and I would like to go back and try it for myself The service was excellent and I liked the ambiance of the place nothing too fussy or pretentious Although be warned around 11 am when  I went it seemed to be crowded with stayathome mums and little kids Dont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with mums or children although the noise level can get a bit too high and it gets somewhat annoying when the majority of mothers are talking to their kids in third person: What are you doing that Mummy is not happy Stop hitting mummy  Jessica Derek etc must be nice to mummy or mummy will not give them cake  ArghOther than this Hellers Kitchen was a pleasant experience and I am looking forward to returningHellers Kitchen is a very modern bistro located on Salisbury Place I was drawn here by the cupcakes displayed in the window as they just looked so yummy they were garnishes with various different colours of cream icing and many of them were topped with jelly beans YummyMy friend and I decided to pop in for a bite to eat and we both went for a cup of tea and a cupcake each and they tasted just as good as they looked The staff were very attentive and friendly and its an excellent place to chill out the seats are very comfy and the lay out is fresh vibrant and very invitingIn addition to food Hellers Kitchen also boasts a full bar which is well stocked and if youre looking for an afternoon or early evening tipple then why not I wont tell anyoneA cosy wee neighbourhood bistro it was a nice place for a spot of lunchI admit I havent explored the local eateries of Newington as much as Id liked but walking to Hellers Kitchen down Causewayside I realised there are a lot of wee restaurants and bistros that offer great lunch dealsAs per Jenfashion Id perused the menu online before but when I arrived and thought I knew what I wanted I was presented with a set lunch which was a pretty good bargain  two courses for 895 when the course Id chosen was 750 anywayAlthough Im getting ahead of myself a little The bistro itself is small and comfortable and was filling up with mums and babies older couples out together and folk on their lunch break The only thing I wasnt too impressed with was the service Later on in our lunch the servers changed and were much friendly But when I came in no one came to seat me no one brought menus till I asked and when placing my order I requested one or two things no goats cheese dressing on the side and was given a look like I was an alien and also a royal pain in the beehind Service with no smileThe food itself was AOk The black pudding starter that should have come with goats cheese except I requested without was a little dry and overcooked The relish it came with helped a bit although I ran out of salad leaves very early onThe grilled haddock fillethowever really was delicious The roasted new potato slices I tried to avoid but demolished the fish was cooked to perfection and a good sized portion I was impressedIt was a nice wee spot to chat for an hour or so it was busy at lunchtime despite being tucked awayAnd you really cant come here without mentioning the cakes I didnt try them but they sit in the window tempting all who walk by and they do look quite epic The cupcakes look really homemade as each one is slightly risen and bumpy in different ways Not quite perfect but just like grandma used to make Ill have to come back to try thoseFood was patchy although overall satisfying service could have been a bit smilier but price was AOk If youre in the neighbourhood its worth a wee look"

    "review":"I love sushi but hate fish There is a contradiction in there somewhere isnt there Anyway as someone who can only stomach prawns or tinned tuna but enjoys sushi Yo Sushi is perfect I love the concept Basically you sit at the counter and all the food is in little colour coded dishes which pass you by on a conveyor belt In the middle there is some Chefs rustling up the dishes so you get to see them making it which proves the food is fresh On the table there is soy sauce Wasabi and ginger so everything you need to complete your meal Im sure you can order off the menu and consult the menu but I just like to watch the dishes go by and pick them up However this can lead to you picking up everything that catches your eye which could result in a large bill so be careful As a hater of seafood I was impressed by the huge selection of alternatives such as fried chicken yes really and vegetables There are some desserts which whizz past but I was too full to have any Which says a lot because usually sushi leaves a little hole in your stomach and I dont mean because its off I think I got a little carried away picking things off the belt Its perhaps not the most authentic Sushi experience considering this is a huge chain restaurant but I love itDisappointingly tiny but a small Yo Sushi is better than none and this is still one of the few saving graces of Edinburghs Harvey NicholsI could eat raw chunks of salmon and seaweed salad every single day and am more than happy to put up with the annoying sounds of screeching phrases piped in Japanese La Roux music on loop and wannabe urbanites to get itDespite the irritations the food is great and Ill grudgingly admit that the whole overstyled concept is actually quite good fun Id still rather give my hardearned to Oishii down the road but Yo is all in all a tremendous sushi experienceIf you sign up to their newsletter you get bargain offers galore so its well worth itConceptually this place is a stroke of genius Sit at what is effectivly a bar stool while different sushi dishes pass you by on a moving belt airport baggage claim style Pick what you want and pay depending on what you have chosen from a colour coded pricing systemFirstly the food is great  sushi isnt always my first choice of something to eat but somehow I always manage to enjoy myslef at Yo Sushi  maybe its the fact that not everything is traditional sushi Theres a nice mixture of fish and none fish dises as well as some other little bits and bobs that add a bit of a change of paceIts a shame then that this place is so small  but I think thats what makes it such good fun to come and eat here Its modern chique and very good funA real winnerThis place has been a long time coming and has been eagerly anticipated Its really cool too and in one of the coolest places to be in Edinburgh  4th floor Harvey NicholsSimon Woodrall the man behind Yo Sushi really was ahead of his time with these restaurants  the idea is geniusThe food is good too but to be perfectly honest Im really not a sushi person It was wasted on me I didnt enjoy myself because of the food but my brothers loved it Its all down to tasteLocated in Harvey Nichols this is a very small branch of Yo Sushi indeed but is nonetheless super tasty Im glad to see that this place has plenty of good reviews as I find that Yo Sushi tends to get a slating for being too cool and not as authentic as other sushi restaurants Ive never been to Japan but am hopefully moving there next year where I will finally be able to see whats authentic and whats not but I do know that pretty much every sushi restaurant outside Japan is in some way tailored to suit the tastes of the country it finds itself in so I dont get why Yo Sushi gets such a hard time Plus they have a much more extensive menu than other sushi places including sesame seed seaweed and my favourite Dorayaki pancakes that Ive never ever found in any other Japanese restaurant in ScotlandMake sure you sign up for the newsletter as they often send out toogoodtoresist offersLet down by the lack of atmosphere even at nighttime as you cant get away from the fact that youre in a department store for your dinner  they seem to have got rid of the little robots that used to wander about the floor when the central Edinburgh site was in Rose Street The above aside the dining experience was as pleasant as Ive experienced in the past and the range of dishes has definitely increased in the last few years Staff were courteous and chatty and there was very little delay between asking for a specific dish to be made and it appearing before us Taking advantage of the unlimited miso soup and having just a couple of plates of sushi could see you fill up well for very little Definitely somewhere else on the list of revisits"

    "review":"We were greeted by a superfriendly maitre d who took us to our table next to one of the windows  Knowing it was a celebration for us Mark had left an anniversary card from himself on the table a keepsake and we were soon nursing a couple of glasses of bubbly  lovely stuff thanks Mark The restaurant itself was fitted out in a contemporary versus traditional sort of fashion and was relaxing and interesting  I was particularly drawn to the main lighting of the roomWe ordered a bottle of Don Nicanors 2012 Malbec Mendoza to help us peruse the menu  This was decided on with a little help from our fantastic sommelier I think there were two sommeliers on that night and it sure was a lovely MalbecNot long after ordering we were presented with some lovely fresh bread  butter and an amusebouche of tomato gazpacho tomatoes sourced from Cyrenians Farm a Social Enterprise just outside Edinburgh that Mark sources a lot of fresh ingredients from with basil and roasted cucumber and tomato jelly  This was really tasty classic combination of tomato and basil and the jelly was a new one on us and went really well It was served on a piece of wood from Marks partners parents garden Mrs G chose the venison carpaccio served with soused tomatoes tomato tartare and parmesan snow to start  She enjoyed this very much and wolfed up every last bit  The tartare added a subtle sharpness which complimented the rest of the dish very well the capers cornichons I think and parmesan topped it off with style Id opted for the duo of hand dived west coast scallops which came served with pork crackling Dashi broth soy caramel sea vegetables and rice wine vinegar jelly  One scallop owas cooked with the soy caramel whereas the other one was served in the shell with the crackling and was finely sliced and raw  The eating process involved cooking the raw one by pouring the broth over it and letting it cook while devouring the other  This added a bit of fun to the dish and I liked the thinking behind it  This dish was simply deliciousWe were then presented with a Cona coffeemaker full of Marks take on cockaleekie soup  Again this added some fun to this unexpected dish  Id seen Jak ODonnell using one of these on Great British Menu just a couple of weeks before this visit so was most pleased to see it in action up close  The percolated broth was poured over the chicken rice and fig  This was delicious so fresh and clean tasting as well as having that xfactor buzz Moving onto the mains and Mrs G had chosen to go with the beef or more accurately the 40day dry aged fillet of Aberdeen Angus  This was accompanied by a celeriac gratin oxtail cannelloni wild mushrooms watercress pure and a red wine jus  Safe to say she absolutely loved this dish too insisting I tried it  I duly obliged  The beef was pink and tender as it should be served the waitress had mentioned this was how it came which pleased us both  The accompaniments were equally good it was a strong main course it was also presented in an elegant contemporary fashionI really could not make my mind up right up to the point of ordering  Somehow the words Ill go with the pork came out  Upon seeing my 11 hour slow roasted Clash Farm belly of pork served with a pork cheek pie blackened fillet sweetcorn and toffee apple jus I was very happy  It looked terrific and tasted utterly amazing  Every single morsel of food on this well thought out plate was delectable  It really was specialWe were then brought as a wee refresher what Mark describes as strawberries and custard and what I would describe as a strawberry panna cottalike pot of beauty  This really was delicious and probably should have quelled my desire for a dessertMrs G decided to forego dessert in favour of cheese and selected the Cornish Yang Lanark Blue and Brie Campagnard  These were served with frozen grapes quince oatcakes crackers celery and apricot  We both very much enjoyed these lovely cheesesI decided to forego cheese in favour of dessert and opted for Marks Great British Menu Knot Chocolate Tart  This came with custard jelly frozen cookies crme fraiche parfait salted caramel and kumquat pure  The presentation was amazing and it was matched by the flavours  Everything worked together so well and I had no trouble finishing it all off  DeliciousWe were now both full to the brim and ordered a couple of espressos to try and offset the sleepiness  These came with homemade chocolate bars white chocolate lollipops and fruit pastilles  The indulgence continued  Again everything was truly excellentThis was a hugely successful trip to Mark Greenaway and I can easily understand why there were no empty tables he has got a fantastic name for himself here and quite rightly so  Superb service environment presentation quality and taste  Restaurant Mark Greenaway oozes brillianceoverall is very impressive the service was not good as the food It was a great meal for a reasonable priceNo exaggeration this might be the best meal I have ever had  The complexity of the flavours in the milletpopcorn starter was out of this world and this wasnt even what the waiter recommended  The vegetables chosen to accompany the monkfish main course managed to deliver a unique and different taste with each bite without ever overwhelming the underlying flavour In my opinion that was megaimpressiveI deducted a star because the decor  atmosphere was a tiny bit staid but promptly gave the star back because the dessert knocked me off my seat with delight and the service was immaculateI know this review sounds a little melodramatic but it really is this goodOooooh a downgrade  OuchAfter my previous amazing meal at MG I had been going on about wanting to return for over a year  So The Man surprised me by booking lunch here on NYE  My first visit was when the restaurant was located on Picardy Place  Unfortunately I found that the move to N Castle Terrace resulted in a downgrade in surroundings as well as food  When eating at a restaurant that is aiming for a Michelin star you dont expect the wait staff to wear dirty uniforms that are missing buttons and you dont expect the stairwell to the toilets to be scuffed and dirty  Once you get to the bottom of the scruffy stairs you are in a cold dank corridor that leads you to toilets that were upgraded by painting the tiles black  Tiles  paint  time  scratches and general shabbiness  So far nothing particularly rang of fine diningThis wouldnt be an issue if the standard of food was what I remembered  My starter a veloute was tasty though a bit uninteresting and in The Mans pan fried duck egg the duck egg itself was undercooked to the point of still having clear eggy slime on the topI opted for the slow cooked pork belly that stole my heart on my previous visit and The Man had what I believe must have been the oven roasted salmon  He loved the soft shelled crab but found the rest of the dish to be standard fare  My pork belly was nice but dry and lacking in some kind of oomphThe theme here is that the food was perfectly nice but wasnt exciting  Everything was absolutely fine but not what I expected from Mark Greenaway   Im probably being too extreme in my opinions considering we had three courses for 20 which is a fabulous deal but if I had paid full price for the food I would have been UNimpressed  The bright star of the meal was the maitre dsommelier  He was wonderful charming friendly and spot on with service  But unfortunately I left feeling let down  After a year of salivating to go back I was left wishing we had gone elsewhereHad a fabulous lunch here with a foodie friend visiting from London Luckily it was the day before he left otherwise we probably would have been back again the next night for dinnerFull review with photos please visit my blog which can be found on my profileWe came here for an intimate dinner for two in December  Since the Christamas menu hadnt much appealed to us we opted for ordering off the a la carteThe atmosphere is small yet clean crisp tables and quiet conversations by candlelit make the space work  Staff were welcoming upon our entrance and I liked the meticulously organised bar on view  It was a cute gesture to have personalised cards to our party on the table waiting for usWe were started off with some Champagne then came the veloute  It had a nice texture of crisp garnish to the foam of the body and a vibrant contrast of colors  But other than that it was an average veloute      The scallop starter consisted of a raw scallop  an already cooked one served separately on a bamboo serving tray  I could see the sear on the outside of the cooked scallop was perfectly done but the inside was ever so slightly under  Minimal seasoning meant a clean aftertaste but the one cooked item of the dish should have been perfectly cooked  One raw scallop diced and presented within its shell was the layout I had to pour hot dashi into  This provided for the theatrical component of the night as the sizzle of bonito flakes reacted to the hot liquid and dry ice wispily escaped through the strategically placed river stones  It was cute but nothing new  Scallops were fresh combined with ingredients that worked but nothing overly impressiveThe mains had were the Perthshire red leg partridge and the Aberdeen aged beef fillet  I enjoyed the partridge and all its little garnishes and trimmings  The skin separately crisped then rolled back onto the flayed meat pieces provided for the perfect bite of meat  The puree went harmoniously with the protein and the croutons did add the nice crunch however the overall plate was more a visual dance than a tribute to taste  Aberdeen fillet was delicious and a bit carried away  There was too much going on in that plate and cannot say all of them worked  For fine dining doesnt quite hit the spot  For atmosphere its nice but a bit rigidSomething here seemed a tad mismatched for me  Dishes were slightly outdated and not as innovative for fine dining but prices were fairer than at proper fine dining restaurants  But then again this felt more like an attempt at imitating what fine dining should be rather than the menu displaying actual culinary zeal  It was all a bit boring  If I want fine dining or even something similar Id choose another  Had a reasonably good experience but for what it is you can have better elsewhere"

    "review":"This is a really good Chinese I first heard about them after being recommended to give it a try from a friend I have never actually been there in person so can give no details on what the restaurant is actually like inside but the food tastes great and thats the most important thingMe and a vegetarian friend found that there were plenty of options on their menu to be tempted by and I eventually opted for chicken chow mein and found that the dish was great and had lots of flavour to it Whats more is that it came with lots of vegetables which made me feel justified in eating it all The delivery time was quite long taking about 40 minutes but the price was reasonable and would definitely order again from hereMy local and the best The staff are really friendly and even though its busy you never have to wait long And the food is super tasty One of the reasons I love this area"

    "review":"Perfect lunch spot tucked away a bit behind Peters Yard in the Quartermile serving up quality sourdough pizza and lovely healthy saladsI went with friends and we ordered 4 slices of the vegetarian pizza which was garlic and mushroom that day and a little box of white bean salad All very fresh and clean tasting in an environment that matched Its really airy and pristine in there and it feels upmarket I found the prices very reasonable for pizza The only downside is its a bit hidden from view so many people dont even know about itAfter viewing some properties in the quarter mile development it seemed important to venture into the world of food drink and retailers that this area had to offer Soderberg is a great space that theyve made homely with lanterns hung from the ceiling and comfy seats to sit at Considering they had a glass box to work with theyve made great use of the space and its a lovely spot to people watch The coffees here arent the best in Edinburgh and with Brew Lab being an 8 minute stroll away Id say its worth the walk for a proper coffee there however does Brew Lab offer sourdough pizzas The answer is no and even if they did they wouldnt touch the Swedish sourdough deliciousness that Soderberg  offers Pizza can be bought in multiples of 2 slices with a simple offering of margarita and regularly changing specials of a meat option and veggie alternative I opted for 2 slices of the margarita and was really impressed Thin sourdough base creamy mozzarella and a tangy yet sweet sauce I also had 3 slices arrive instead of 2 so considered this to be my lucky dayPeters Yard is a beloved Edinburgh independent that over the last few years has expanded Taking a large part of the frontfacing Quartermile with Peters caf this new venture is tucked behind the Meadowsfacing promenade and may not catch the passing footfall tradeBut if you venture 20 metres behind Middle Meadow Walk youll find the most delightful lanternlit romantic Swedish pizzaplace you could find A slightly slicker more elegant version of their daytime caf with plain wooden tables allglass walls exposed pipe ceilings massive lanterns hanging in a mismatched fashion and a big stove right in the centre where they cook the pizza Why its just charmingIm already a known PY addict with their flat white and fruit bun being my weakness But this new place has the evening charm required to carry off something just different enough to have a good reason to go here even if youve already been to the caf earlier that dayAnd it goes without saying the pizza is delicious Thin crispy not oily at all with a range of differnet toppings I went for Iberico ham and my friend had the goats cheese with beetroot Very high quality but not TOO filling a whole pizza each didnt feel too fiendishWith a Swedish platter for starters pizzas for main and delicious looking desserts as well as a wine list and even gin its the perfect evening romantic spot for laid back but classy diningTheres a limited menu here for lunch but from the options you can choose from theyre absolutely delicious I came here for the sourdough pizza Was absolutely craving it and it hit just the spotThere pizzas are thin crust and baked in proper pizza oven For a large 8 slice pizza easily shared between two people its comes at a good 12 price We opted for a half vegetarian half meat pizza coupled with a mug of their specialty hot chocolate First pizza was perfectly cooked The dough was flavourful and slightly crispy warm and perfectly cooked Toppings were generous but not overloadedSecond Soderberg is known for their drinks and their speciality hot chocolates are an incredibly interesting taste in a good way I tried the cardamom hot chocolate which wasnt what I expected but it had a wonderful rich chocolate tasteOverall its quite a small location so easily packed but would definitely recommend for a date or small group meals Especially if youre looking for some good pizza this hits the spot perfectlyBesides the fact that this might be one of the most confusing places to actually GET to its pretty darn lovely once you find it Now should you happen upon Soderberg without issue that opening sentence will confuse you because its not a tiny place Its not as though its tucked away in a hole in the wall Its more hiding in plain sight The problem arises with the Soderberg websiteany sort of internet based direction within the Quartermile Why Because in a block of buildings with very little signage lives THREE Soderberg spots: Peters Yard Soderberg Bakery Shop and Soderberg this one the one with pizza Following the confusion The amount of times Ive checked in to the wrong one sheeshIve been a fan of the sourdough flatbread pizza for quite awhile and when the Peters Yard closest to my house in Stockbridge stopped serving it I purposely sought this place out I heard a few grumbles during the festival of it being chaotic but having been right in the middle of Fringetown you can hardly blame them Now that they crowds have gone I daresay it has returned to a perfect little spot to grab lunch when in the area Bonus points With Looking Glass Books right around the corner and free wifi in and around it makes the Quartermile a one stop out of office office destination Im a happy camper"

    "review":"This small deli located on Edinburghs Causeway side always seems to have somebody in no matter what time you may be passingThere are of course some very good reasons for this  firstly the freshly prepared food is always high quality and has a vast range to choose from Secondly the sheer value of the food and drinks  both in price and promotions such as free teas or coffees with sandwiches and other snacks There is a small seating area but its not quite a sit in cafeThe Grange Deli is a nice little place to grab a bite to eat and a coffeeI agree with Johnathan here dont come here expecting a seat unless you bring your own deck chairThe food is pretty good though youre usual soup and sandwich establishment Where they really shine is the coffee specifically Lattes So creamy and a good milktocoffee ratio toowhatThats importantGreat for a quick bite or a monster sandwichPRICE: The prices are great You can get a good sized lunch for less than a fiverSIZE: Only a wee place more suited to takeaways Still a couple of seats about if you are aloneCHOICE: Plenty of choice here and the ingredients are fresh Loads of breads and fillings plus drinks choices and so onGrange Deli or Grange Takeaway as it has been renamed recently is a fine little breakfast and lunch sandwich stop perfect for grabbing a bite to eat for lunch on the way to or from the University of Edinburghs Kings Buildings The food is spread out behind the counter and is put together before your eyes There are a few different breads and a multitude of fillingsThe staff are friendly it is run by a couple of ladies who are quite cheerful and chatty and if you pop in a few times they soon get to know you The place has a pleasant feel as you wait for your sandwich to appear before you and I once popped in to find top class funk band The Bamboos playing All in all a great little spotAs a last note if you are stuck for which sandwich to buy I have but one suggestion for you: buy the Coronation Chicken It is by far the best coronation chicken sandwich I have ever sunk my teeth into My friends agree Excellent Once again an enthusiastic thumbsupThis place isnt called Grange TakeAWAY for nothing so no complaints about the lack of seatingThis is a nice wee sandwichbreakfasthot drinks takeaway joint perfect for grabbing a quick big bite These are all made using fresh ingredients This is no baguette express They do also nice soup usually a choice of two and often both vegetarianAlso note that they offer free tea and coffee with breakfast orders before 11:30"

    "review":"Essentially not a lot other than the colour scheme has changed here since it took on its current persona apart from the Friday Happy Hour that looks to have bitten the dust Comfy couches good efficient bar service and a well stocked and varied bar are the staples 450 for a large bottle of Grolsch PardonIts a nice place with an inviting atmosphere I stopped in for lunch They were busy but not packed My grilled chicken sandwich was tasty  though calling it a banh mi seemed to be a bit of a stretch My largest complaint is that the service was slow I had three people see to different parts of the service  yet getting one of them to bring me a glass of water in under 5 minutes seemed impossible Which was annoying given the fact that one of the guys spent a good part of the time slicing limes The sandwich was tasty enough that Id give another tryI really liked this place its a shame though that the staff let it down None of them seemed like they wanted to be there and we felt like we were in the way for wanting to order a drink Once the bartender got off his shift though and joined his mates in the bar he was full of life if only he could have been a bit more like that when workingThere is a pleasant vibe in this place The layout is open and could made a bit cosier Nevertheless I enjoyed sitting and watching people coming in and chatting at the bar The cocktail Raspberry Pegu Club was fresh and got me wanting moreThe crispy chicken breaks was tasty but the dip could have been more up to level The Japanese meatballs were moist  but due to size  they would have benefitted from a dip as well Both portions were a big size Maybe even too big as a starterThe noodles salad with chicken was zesty a nice mix of warm and clod and crisp and soft It needed a bit more spice though  so I asked for some hot chili sauce I got sweetsour back Too bad  I always like the extra sting when eating a Vietnamese style saladThe menu isnt extremely big but theres probably something to everybodys likingConclusion: will I be back Most probably yesThe food here is decent I had a full Scottish breakfast which included baked beans black pudding an egg haggis bacon sausage toast a hash brown and a tea or coffee However I ordered my tea and got it right away but had to wait an hour for my food to arrive and by that time my tea was finished When I got my meal I asked for some more hot water in the teapot and finished my very large breakfast But when I got the bill I realized that they charged me 150 to refill my pot with hot water They didnt give me a new tea Bit strange but the Scottish breakfast is absolutely huge and worth the moneyMy cousins and I decided to grab a quick lunch here before heading out to do more sight seeing The restaurant itself is cute and has a modern appeal to it I ordered the sweet potato and spinach pie It was very tasty as the sweet potato and spinach complemented each other very well The crust on the pie was divine and was flaky crispy and buttery These guys sure know how to make their pies I was in heaven The potato wedge chips that came on the side were not as good and were on the bland side They were quite ordinary and needed some serious seasoning and flavor These could have been a lot better It tasted like someone just chopped up potatoes and put them in the oven without any preparation They also seemed a bit charred too Overall Id come back here again for another pie and ask for a different side"

    "review":"As we were looking for a tapas restaurant that wasnt too expensive and still had a table for two on a Saturday night we stumbled upon La Sal Id not heard of this restaurant before as its a bit further from where I usually venture for restaurantsI was a bit early for my reservation but this was no problem and I was seated by the friendly owner The tables felt a bit close together but other than that it was great I mulled over the winelist and was happy to see they offered wine by 500ml as well since a bottle is usually too much for the two of us My boyfriend arrived and we decided on 5 different tapas and the house wine The tapas arrived quickly first the bread when we finished that the two fried dishes and after we devoured that the two meat dishes PerfectI found the food a little bit bland but that might be personal because my boyfriend didnt find that at all We finished off with Spanish desserts and a liquor unfortunately they didnt offer dessert wineThe service was good very friendly and mostly timely as well After we finished our desserts we werent asked if we wanted coffee or the bill so we went to the front to pay upIt had a nice atmosphere but I definitely had better tapas before I might be back to try out different dishes but I would probably go to a different restaurant if it was my choiceIt was bad Bad slow service from the start when you wait 15 minutes for ANY attention and that person can only take a drinks orderand cant even do that right when it is ONE bottle of wineBAD SIGN Out of 7 things we ordered 2 were ok the rest bad or worse than bad  Paying 360 for a garlic dip and a spicy dip on the side was ridiculous Totally horribly canned or jarred horrible sauces that left horrible tastes in my mouth For nearly 4 extra quid awful The food was so bad we stopped consuming and I currently feel queasy Never even got the patatas bravas we ordered which was probably a good thing  On a good point the waiter did remove 2 of the uneaten dishes after we said they were bad but that was literally the only attention we had from him all nightIt was not a good space to enjoy a night out in and the product was well below par too We definitely wont be back ever and cant recommendThis Tapas restaurant is a lively cosy place tucked on the corner of a cobbled side alley close to the PleasanceI have never been to Spain and have not tried tapas before so Im far from an expert though I believe  that tapas traditionally is a small bar snack to accompany drinks in a pubThat being said the tapas here is expanded to make it large enough for a main meal when two or three of the tapas are combined We had patatas bravas cubed chips essentially chorizo in red wine sauce battered mushrooms and cheese grilled peppers butter beans and black pudding black pudding and relishall of these had Spanish names obviously but I cant remember them battered cubes of fish iberico ham and prawns in garlic and olive oil and to finish churros and coffeeFirstly the iberico ham was the standout for me by a mile its cut from a big leg that stands triumphantly  near the entrance it was sweet savoury and full of rich creamy fatThe prawns and the fish were cooked to perfection however the majority of the other dishes were underseasoned The peppers should have been encrusted liberally with salt apparently but didnt seem to have any seasoning at all so tasted bland The patatas bravas werent crispy like good chips but limp and soggyDont want to go on and moan a lot but the main issue was simply lack of flavourWhich is a shame because service was friendly and they put up with our rather boistrous birthday celebrations with good humour and brought out some ice cream with sparklers and played Happy Birthday but I feel the ruthless sword of truth must be wielded The churros were again a bit lacking on sugar and pale and anaemic looking  and the chocolate sauce could have been thickerIt wasnt a terrible meal by any stretch of the imagination all perfectly edible but needed more flavourOne final issue was that the meal had to be conducted in two shifts as it were because the table was too small to contain all the tapas wed orderedNice little Spanish restaurant quite hidden away just off Nicolson Street Marys parents and sisters visited Edinburgh for a weekend and wanted to take us out for a nice dinner Coming across La Sal purely by chance a reservation was made It was a good choice We decided to have a selection of tapas for the table washed down with the house white wine I tried a selection of chicken pork and vegetarian options plenty of tortilla type dishes among them Im no expert on Spanish food but Im definitely a fanThe staff are very friendly indeed I really adore Spanish accents and all the staff here seem to have them They were helpful and offered suggestions as to what we should tryMarys mother left behind her scarf accidentally but there was no problem retrieving it the next day La Sal is worth a tryIts a pity so few know of this place Hidden in the back streets of Newington Spanish food and culture is flourishing with tapas dishes Spanish wine and flamenco music They offer live flamenco shows on weekends with amazing dance and there is also a flamenco school next door for those who wish to learn flamenco dance singing clapping percussion and guitar  The lunch deal is great 3 course for 750 or Main w coffee tea 550 and it is excuse my language delicious Ole"

    "review":"The Morningside Spice is a fantastic Indian restaurant on Morningside Road It has recently undergone a refurbishment and now the interior looks classy and modern I went for a meal there this evening and there were fresh tulips on the tables it was a nice touch The staff are wonderful whenever I visit I am greeted like an old friend its one of the reasons I keep going back Tonight I ordered the lamb tikka it is a relatively simple dish but a lot depends on the quality of the lamb needless to say the quality of the meat was excellent and I enjoyed my dinner immensely I finished off with the pistachio kulfi which the waiter informed me was homemade it was delicious and my mum declared it magnificent I cant wait for my next visitMorningside Spice is a great Indian restaurant with a good well organised menu and great food and service  I went there for the first time about three weeks ago and the decor inside was pretty stunning with a fresh contemporary feel  The menu has a whole range of kebabs of varying sorts as well as the usual rogan josh balti and tikka dishes  I opted for the beef karahi which I hadnt ever tried before and it tasted great  I love cardamom seeds and this dish had plenty of them with a good balance of heat and real flavour  The portions are a perfect size even for big eaters and the naans are some of the biggest and best I think I have ever eaten  The service is quick and friendly and they also do free deliveries on takeaways under 10 which I would certainly recommend  I cant really fault this place as its moderately priced with great food and a chilled out atmosphereMorningside Spice is a great Indian restaurant and takeaway in the Morningside area of Edinburgh  in an ideal location for students to pop into for their lunch or dinner They offer a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine which is cooked with fresh spices and is always full of flavour I ordered the Chili Garlic Chicken which was completely delicious but really spicy and it felt like my mouth was on fire by the end of the meal The rice is excellently cooked and the naan breaks are massive  yum Morningside Spice also had wide selection of vegetarian meals and I had the vegetable pakoras to start which were amazing The waiters in the restaurant were warm and welcoming and incredibly efficient in their service They also offer a takeaway service which was really popular was I was dining in the restaurant and having tasted their food I can see why The only downside which I could see was that the people who were ordering takeaways were waiting a long time for their food but it was a busy Friday night so it is probably to be expectedI will definitely be back at Morningside Spice for another curry soon I loved itI found the food to be way too greasy compared to what I know from other indian places Very tasty though Service was slow but that may be due to the bigger groups that were there at the time I orderedAmazing delicious best Indian weve had in the UK Veg dishes were all awesome as was the chappati Kashmiri chicken was also good Lamb roganjosh was ok would not recommend In general a great meal nice atmosphere good service and kid friendly place Highly recommended Weve compared every restaurant weve been to to this place for the past two weeksWe had a takeaway from Morningside Spice which was ok  The poppadoms were very tasty and the dips very nice however the main courses were a little bland  My husband had chicken Bhuna and I had Kashmiri chicken  However it did come very quickly and the staff were friendly"

    "review":"Nice soups and sandwiches  using it a lot when i work in the areaThey have cheap soups and hot lunches Seems homemade i am not really sure and the choice changes daily Lots of different rolls and sandwichesVery quick service and always friendlyGet there before 12:30 as the soups start to be sold out and you will be stuck with cream of mushroom and tomato So narrow its really just a corridor Club Sandwich boasts Edinburghs widest selection of soups probably with a daily choice of eight The soup I tried a potato and Double Gloucester was absolutely excellent Their rolls were very good too so Id highly recommend a visitOverall we said: its another one in the win column for Dundas Street Given that they have a branch of the New Town Deli just round the corner this little parade of shops now boasts three exceptional Soupquest soups giving solid credence to the notion that this is may be emerging as a second Edinburgh soup district I know that the area near to the university with Union of Genius Elephant Juice and Peters Yard had been to my mind Edinburghs home of soup but there is definitely a pretender to the crown Vive les quartiers de soupe I say"

    "review":"With space for max 20 people this wee cafe is not great for large groups of tourists and is therefore ideal for a quiet coffee a stones throw from the thronging crowds of the grassmarket and the castle They serve Caffe Di Canto traditional Bar Mix beans and the latte tastes good Not too strong and lovely smooth creamy froth Slight nuttiness in the aroma The barista let me sniff the beans which were darkly roasted and deeply rich in character typically Italian I tried a bean and it was smoky and strong Other things of note speciality Sicilian pastries almond and cardamom spiced buns plus full breakfast toasties and bruschetta menu Also do Italian food including pizza focaccia paninis soups and cold meat plates Some outdoor seating Quiet reggae music in backgroundWhen I noticed that the Blackcherry Cafe has closed down and somewhere called Caffe Piccolo had opened in its place I added it to my list for a visit I was really pleasantly surprised by what theyve done the place as its really very smart The influence is now strongly Italian with some outstanding sandwiches of offer Its not the cheapest but the quality is really good Id recommend a visitOverall we said: I thought Caffe Piccolo was really impressive I look forward to timing my visit better next time so I can try their soup If its as good as their sandwiches I will be a very happy chappyNothing to do with little flutes  piccolo is Italian for small which suits this Mondrian delight on the southeastern corner of Grassmarket perfectly Primary coloured benches surround three sides of a table in the window unsinkably cheerful  rather like the proprietor who for the sake of clarity does not surround three sides of a table by the window I had a delicious panini  I cant remember precisely what was in it bacon and some other things but they had me at bacon It was perfectly done  fluffy yet crispy and generously filled but not overly so Theres a good range on the menu from droolworthysounding focaccias to a couple of really lovely soups My partner for lunch that day had the vegetable soup and Im told it was brace yourselves souperb Thank you thank youYou pick up your soft drinks from the fridge and its 150 for a can which you might wince at if it were a vending machine but which seems reasonable in a cafe The fact that you pick them up them yourself and theyre still in a can does kind of emphasise the markup though despite the fact that we were later brought glasses to decant them intoHowever the touch I really liked was  oddly  paying Apparently they had ordered the wrong kind of card machine  one that has to plug into a telephone point instead of a wireless one  so I had to toddle on through the back door and into the kitchen to pay Seems funny but that little touch of character and quirk actually made it for me I really hope they keep it that wayStopped in here for lunch 8 for lasagna 6 for a soupThey are really strict about who can sit at their cafe with signs EVERYWHERE saying you need to order hot food to sit downWhen I came in a lady immediately asked me if I was ordering food I was looking at the menu yes Id like to order foodShe left and my server was much more friendlyA bit pricey and no other pastas on the menu but the food was goodNothing that would have me running back here again but I enjoyed the food all the sameThe cakes look pretty goodLovely little cafe in one of my favourite parts of Edinburgh The waitress was so sweet and attentive and it was a cool place go sit and chill and drink coffee for a couple of hours However I thought the soup was way too expensive for a wee cafe 6 quid and it tasted pretty average to me But very cute place"

    "review":"Had a couple of excellent meals here and plan on many more The huge menu demands return visits If you feel overwhelmed by the choice on offer the staff are happy to suggest dishes Its unlicenced but there is no corkage so pick up some booze from one of the offlicences on Nicholson Street A tip though: its a familyrun place with a small kitchen staff so go early especially if youre a large party The food is well worth the wait thoughThe food was just ok and kind of bland  We have enjoyed Indian food around the globe and neither the food nor the service impressed  It was Ramadan so maybe that had an effect but after all the great reviews we were disappointedJust dined here last evening on a trip to Edinburgh Read their 1 reviews on trip advisor and had to stop by for a bite It definitely met all my expectations Personalized service home cooked authentic food I always return home from a trip craving a meal from my own kitchen tired of mass produced restaurant food The owners parents are the cooks and the home cooking really shines through I ordered the lamb rogannjosh with garlic naan Lamb was fork tender curry well seasoned and containing bits of fresh veggies chopped up including sliced tomato This curry was made with loving hands not poured from a jar Bravo I have no doubt youll enjoy your meal if you stop by My only regret was that I couldnt taste all the unique curries offered but I guess thats just a reason to go back tummy growlsGood but not as great as others are saying The BadThe naan simply wasnt very good I am used to fresh fluffy naan with intense garlic flavour These were huge but rather flavourless and a bit chewy The pilau rice was also fairly flavourless and disappointing For the mains our tandoori chicken was okay but the meat was overcooked and dry The GoodOur curry was quite pleasant and the mango lassi was also good Also no complaints on the service VerdictPerhaps we had over inflated expectations but this was simply a decent Indian restaurant with nothing exceptional I take the sides rice and naan seriously and they were a let downI thought I wasnt in the mood for Indian food so we tried another place first but were turned away not having booked Our second choice turned out only to be a lunch place now closed for the evening A pub crowded with students did not appeal We decided to try Kismot since it was next door to the noisy pub Although without a reservation we were seated immediately Having only a hour before the concert we wished to attend we ordered only one dish to share plus two kinds of naan The garlic coriander naan arrived fairly quickly It tasted only mildly of its toppings The cheese naan arrived with our main dish and was really delicious Finally the main dish arrived It was a revelation: chocolate massallam This was the most amazing thing I tasted during the ten days we spent in London and Edinburgh It didnt taste exactly like chocolate but had a rich flavor so unexpected and delicious that after Jeremy left to the concert I stayed behind to finish every bit of it One caveat: this does not come with rice If desired rice must be ordered separatelyI told our server wed be back every day to sample more of their menu but sadly that was not to be Returning to Kismot will be a top priority next time Im in EdinburghFriendly efficient service was the icing in the cake of the best lamb saag Ive ever eaten BYOB policy no corkage charge  whats not to like"

    "review":"Oh my lord my tastebuds are still doing a wee happy dance  Ive had the kind of food that makes you want to not pollute your mouth with anything substandardAll that heralds one of the best Italian restaurants in Edinburgh is an inauspicious burnished red awning just across from Haymarket StationThe kitchen is full of Italian voices and incredible smells the restaurant is packed with regulars and locals some speaking Italian to the wonderful old waiters some simply enjoying an incredible mealGamberoni with a side of spinacci fills my nostrils and when I try it it makes me chew slowly making the I cant believe its legal to eat this in public face  The chicken dish is apparently orgasmic  Happy faces and tastebuds all roundThe spinacci was so simple and so good that it subsequently launched a google recipe search and repeated trips to Sainsburys for ingredients over the following months while I perfected itI often think that good food allows you to guess at the ingredients but no one ingredient stands out as overpowering the others  It should create a sensation thats like looking at a piece of art: you dont always see the brush strokes that create the whole piece  La Bruschetta does this well  The food made me want to relearn the language just so I could appreciate all the nuance of itLike any proper Italian place theyre closed on Sunday and Monday but its well worth making a booking for a table at this wonderful wee piece of ItalyThis place is a dream Delicious food served by professional staff The veal is to die for  you wont eat better tiramisu anywhere Small place but very specialThis place has a very good reputation as evidenced by the 5 star reviews from Kay L and Ann MIts very popular with locals and is regularly busy and we found it so on our visit Dishes were accurate and tasty but they werent particularly outstanding Their risotto lacked moisture for me and the pasta was good but not great Its a very cute little place though and the service is very good so its worth a visitOverall we said: La Bruschetta was a very decent local Italian I understand why it attracts its loyal following They have a sound and commendable commitment to serving fresh local ingredients but it would be lovely to see more innovation in their dishes to raise things above solid and reliable For now yes go and visit but Im not sure youll be blown away"

    "review":"What a wonderful experience My flatmate and I were looking for a place to do a bit of university work and popped into Akva having never been there before We were greeted on arrival given a choice of were to sit and given menus etc We had some tea and a sharing platter of snacks which came within minutes We were able to sit upstairs for several hours undisturbed One employee came along at one point to let us know that a fairly large party of children would be arriving that afternoon and let us know that there was a comfy seating area in a slight alcove so we wouldnt be disturbed We also ordered the soup of the day which was delicious I would thoroughly recommend this as a good spot to study read or just chat with friendsMy first time here I am impressed by first of all the chic sophisticated appearance as you walk in with the fairy lights and comfy vintage looking furniture I especially like that Billy holiday is playing on the radio which gives more of that vintage feel I love the quirkiness too and  I recommend that you try the kladdkaka Swedish chocolate cake Its yummy Also its dog friendly so that is a huge plus for me XIn desperate need of a good cocktail in Fountainbridge We stumbled into this very newly opened place at the end of the canal looking for a Friday afternoon drink and found a very pretty Swedish with comfortable seating a fabulous cocktail menu and friendly helpful staff Having seen the breakfast menu we will definitely be back to try it out at a different time of day :As with their takeover of what is now Hemma Edinburghs Swedish pub owners have another sterile modern establishment on their hands here and are doing their best to soften its edges and make it a comfier beast than when it housed the hole that was CargoOn the brief evidence afforded by a visit for a cup of tea and cake earlier this week it seems they are succeeding Service was good if a little swift at the table clearing we had a mouthful of brownie keft on the plate as it was whisked away and the various seating options mostly seemed comfy although we never looked upstairsAs the nearest cafe competition closes at 5pm and with two large Festival productions going on along the road in the coming month Akva could well be on t o a very profitable thingPossibly an off day for the place but standards seem to have slipped since I was in last July It took nearly ten minutes for a member of staff to notice Id taken a seat tables 1  2 are a tad off the circuit and then the wrong dish was initially delivered The cake I ordered failed to turn up at all  this didnt seem to warrant even a brief apology upon settling the billAs its handy for the cinema Ill no doubt pop in again to see if things improve at the third attemptFor Akva being such a large bar it always feels really cosy I have been in many times and always enjoy it I love love love the beer garden out the back overlooking the canal perfect for when the sunshine appears It is so much nicer than cargo I love that it is all colourful and the mismatching furniture is fabulous I love the benches at the big tables and the cosy little booths The decor is great and there is such a nice vibe in this bar no matter what time or day you go in I havent actually had anything to eat here yet I always just go in for drinks with friends and family Usually the service is great and they do their best for you even when it is really busy Last night was the first time I had been in the upstairs area I had booked it for my graduation drinks for all the family and my friends This was the first time I was disappointed in Akva The staff were a bit rude maybe just an off day for some of them and the service wasnt very good It was great at the start of the evening because they had the tennis on and music playing so it was a good atmosphere but eventually a big group of guys came upstairs to sit in front of the huge screen so the tennis was switched off midmatch for the football and the volume went up to the point is was difficult to have a conversation I asked for it to be turned down which they did but it didnt take long for it to go back up again Around 103011pm we were asked to move downstairs for the last hour of the bar being open I am assuming so they could clean and get out faster Overall not very impressed with last night Despite that I really do enjoy going to Akva and I will most certainly be back again and again Now lets just hope for some more sunshine so we can make use of that beer garden"

    "review":"Firstly letme agree with Stephanie T This place is far from rapid at any time of the day Whether there is a huge queue forming out of the door or just you in the whole shop you will wait for what seems like an eternity before you are eventually served Although to give credit where credit is due the actual preperation time of the sandwiches is fairly quick  which may explain why they always look a bit messy and sloppy However once you stop being shallow about your food the sandwiches here are actually pretty damn tasty and good value for what you pay for themI had heard good things about this place but  wasnt overly impressed The service wasnt very good I was treated like a sheep in the market and rushed along the line paid little attention and i dont think anyone behind the counter ever cracked a smile What happened to service with a smileMy sandwich wasnt bad but it wasnt amazing The first few bits were tasty but not so much by the end of itbut not a bad experienceGreat wee sandwich takeaway shop Popular with us office workers for a spot of lunch It can get pretty busy in here at lunch times and I have seen the queue out of the door and down the street I see this place as an alternative to your High end pricy delis and is a pretty cost effective lunch option You pick the roll or bread type then what filling  fillings you want on it Optional choice of salad on top and hey presto your done in a flash Not bad veggie options eitherThe sandwich versatile tasty nutritious I love em Welcome then to the Mecca of sandwich making that is Rapid Rolls Youve got to go here The selection of breads is huge the fillings delicious everything is fresh and made to the highest standards Im not sure they even know how good they are The service is so quick and always friendly and they seem so modest Im genuinely in aweI worked briefly in Subway whos mantra was thus: You can go to any Subway anywhere in the world and youll get the same sandwich I dont think Ive heard a more soul destroying and mind numbing business ideology before or since To take a blank canvass and paint The Last Supper once will make you famous to photocopy it and sell it worldwide will make you nothing more than a shameless imposter with all the talent and originality of your average Big Brother contestant This place provides a masterclass in sandwich making everyone else take noteMy only gripe is that the opening hours for this place are a bit thin on the ground and I dont think its open at the weekend but too much of a good thing ehThis has to be my favourite sandwich shop No fancy schmancy quinoa or rocket here but always a nice hearty soup or baked potato and they even made me a smashing salad box today which as always was excellent value for money and far healthier than some salads available in nearby sandwich shops When Im not eating healthy the empire biscuits are amazing but almost sweeter than a Krispy Kreme Lovely friendly service from the ladies that opened it all those years ago"

    "review":"Love this quirky new bar in Newington I came by for wifi and a cuppa and ended up hanging out for longer than expected Needless to say the drink got upgraded to a cocktail ludicrously quickly Well with their Pocket Friendly Cocktail menu who can blame me 350 for a raspberry gin mojito YES PLEASEWith a very stylish interior this place has a lovely atmosphere and nice staff The food and drink prices are pretty good but beware  this place is super busy so if you wan eat book in advance to avoid disappointmentI love that theyre dog friendly and they have a soup n sandwich offer for only 5 through the week Defo worth checking out if youre in the area :CheersNot good Cute place decent beers and drinks But food is sub par Not worth the money Service was ok Nice peopleIve been here 3 times already and always had great service especially the Australian guy who seems to run front of house There was an initial booking issue as this cant be done online but they do take bookings by phone if you speak to them directly  The food is reasonably priced and varied including some vegetarian options The staff were very accommodating for me as a pregnant lady and now lady with a pram even though table space is tight so not ideal multiple prams at once  My only reluctance of giving 5 is that I dont want it to become so popular that I cant get a table myself :It may not be the most accurate to write a review of Southpour as I actually didnt consume anything hereWe visited today intending to have a drink From the outside the refurb looks decent if generic but from the inside it feels soulless Geared toward table service we were treated oddly when we went up to the tiny bar to check out the beer selection which turned out to be shockingly poor Between the cold atmosphere and the non existent beer selection we decided to leave Big fans of Reverie Southpour appears to be a big loss for the area What a disappointmentThey have a 50 off your bill special if you book a table online before the 20th of MarchDropped in for the 5 lunch special Soup and a sandwich The soup was a carrot and sweet potato and the sandwich was salmon with watercress pesto Both very good Once you factor buying a drink in it actually came to650  but that was still a pretty good deal Its just opened and service was a little slow Im going to put that down to a new restaurant working out the kinks Well worth checking out"

    "review":"As always food is delish  We eat in here probably about 23 times a month and the food the staff the service  everything is tip top  A great amazing wee establishment all round  EAT you must come eatI have a work lunch here every few months and Ive yet to be disappointedAfter a fairly recent refurbishment its a warm welcoming pub with a real wood burning stove and a friendly atmosphere The owners have done a great job in its transformation from dingy local bar to cosy hotelThe food is good home cooked fare Steak and ale pie macaroni cheese scampi and chips exactly what you want from a local village pub I havent sampled the drinks but it seems like it would have a reasonable selection It has outdoor seating at the front and back and also has a decent size car park If youre passing then its well worth a visitFirst time here  Note they stop serving food at 9PM and by 8:45 they were only taking limited ordersI have no idea what the menu looks like as I was not offered one  I asked for a large fish  chips  The portion was ample breading crispy without being overly greasy  The mushy peas were respectfully electricgreen and though a bit dry were some of the better mushy peas Ive had with FC  The inn appears to have a large number of locals and the waitstaff seems a bit undermanned and inattentive I didnt feel particularly welcome nor did there seem to be any rush to fill my glass  In all fairness I didnt see anyone in the back room get any attention so it wasnt just me  Might come back just to have a proper look at the menuIll make sure to come early say about 6PMI figure that should be enough time to get a meal and two drinksAs always brilliant reasonably priced food The chef even is able to adapt the special on the menu to accommodate my dairyfree dietary requirements happydaysThis places name change and redecoration a couple of years ago have certainly taken it into the 21st century Ive eaten here in the recent past too and can safely say that the food is of a standard to match the gastrofeel of the bar interiorWhether due to the tax on the price of a pint or down to what brewers charge youre not paying markedly less than in the centre of Edinburgh seven miles to the East unlike you might expect from its more rural location A round in a smilar establishment in the West of Scotland or in the North East of England would be a different ballgame It is though well stocked and so you enjoy a great deal of choice for your money"

    "review":"Sandwich Express surprised me somewhat Looking from the outside I thought it was going to be one of those fast food snack places that you visit through convenience more than anything else Inside its a different story Although its as small as a cubby hole its also decked out in grand traditional looking solid oak tables and high backed chairs They have a selection of healthy fillings for sandwiches and paninis under the counter not to mention some other snacky options such as chips and hamburgers Its astonishingly cheap for being in the city centre and the staff are really friendlyI would sit in here on a quiet day since its cool compared to the busy high street and sandwiches are served up in healthy portions with a smile So dont be fooled by its small exterior  its big on taste and even bigger on savings Can I have a cheesy pun drumroll please Boom boom tishSandwich Express is like a more grandiose version of Baguette Express but which ultimately offers exactly the same thing The interior decor is impressive with large wooden tables and chairs which look like thrones  The menu offers a huge range of sandwiches baguettes paninis and toasties with an even bigger selection of fillings  The deli counter is probably superior to that of Baguette Express in fact as it had not only the standard coronation chickens and tuna mayos but also a wide range of good quality meats such as smoked chicken and ham  I ordered a cajun chicken baguette with mayonnaise and salad  What I got was coronation chicken with red onion  I wasnt bothered however as it was probably just as nice and Im pretty sure it cost less  Ill definitely be coming here again in the future as the prices are standard and the food is great qualityWhen you think about it all sandwich shops are pretty much the same when it comes to menu  theres always a selection of baguettes and paninnis as well as the same selection of fillings So really what you need is something else to make yourself stand out Sandwich Express fills this requirement with some amazing furniture  which doesnt sound loike much but it makes a real difference from crappy placsic chairs you get in some other places like this The result of the chunky wooden furniture is that I would more than happily come and spend a vast proportion of the day sat here eating my somewhat better than average sandwichMonster portions Best club sandwich and the coleslaw is delicious Would recommend you try this if you fancy a change from the normal takeaways :oThis place is a jewel in Leiths crown The small hidden places are the ones that we search for and never find The other weekend I got very lucky I have been looking for a DECENT burger for ages and there are places that Wanna do well but dont do it for me Well I highly recommend Burgers from here Its not really a burger its HALF A COW The caramelised onions and their coleslaw are awesome If you have space left over go for Apple and chocolate crepes Happy weeblingEveryone talks about the baguettes and paninis at Sandwich Express but when I was a regular visitor about a year ago it was the portion size and quality of their plated dishes that impressed me Homemade carbonara for only a few pounds was a favourite Hopefully they are still serving these dishes if they are then I mightily recommend them as a budget spot on Leith Walk"

    "review":"Very good cocktails from an extensive creative menu So many kinds of bloody mary Makes my heart smile Will definitely have to go back and try the food sometime soonHit upon this new venue by accident A lovely bar which serves excellent food The staff were welcoming and friendly and there is a casual feel There is a fully stocked bar with a wide range of Gins and Vodkas on offer as well as a nice wine selection by the glass There is also an extensive cocktail listThe food was fresh very well cooked and packed with flavour It was also notably well presented The meal was extremely good value for money and I would definitely return if in the area againThe OH spotted an itison voucher for 5 tapas to share  a drink each neither of us had ever tried The Priory before we decided to give it a shot Service was good but the tapas was a bit of a letdown We went for the haggis dumplings meatballs calamari fishcakes  the croquetas to share The haggis dumplings just didnt work The haggis filling was nice but the dumpling was too chewy  too large  not a good match the strong flavour of the haggisThe rest of the tapas was mediocre There was nothing bad about the other dishes but nothing great either In a city with lots of tapas restaurants they need to up their game to compete Maybe the other food on the menu is of a better standard I wouldnt rule out popping in there again if I was in the area but I wouldnt be making a special trip across town to visitNew place only popped in for a couple of drinks but already very impressed Great selection of drinks on tap cocktails and friendly staff Havent tried the food yet but the menu looks greatFound this on Yelp and decided to give it a go Service was friendly and fast We ordered the sea bass which was delicious and the beef burger which was very good though the chips had a little too much salt on them However that was a minor gripe I would definitely eat here again and would recommend it to othersDecor reminds me of ha ha bar and kitchen which was in Glasgow many moons ago Brick walls wood just the same kind if vibe reallyPopped in for a quick drink My cocktail was a bit meh but Jenny and Lauras choices were lovely Menu looks great and I do plan a return visit to try as lots of tasty options and I would like to further explore the cocktail menu"

    "review":"Popped in here after seeing that the place had been renovated for a quick pint In its previous guise it was quite a rough and ready establishment and probably not worth lingering in Now its a completely different place Nice decor lots of fancy beers and doing amazing looking food There was a good range of beers to tempt us and we settled on a wheat beer and cider this is probaly the only downside we experienced the price For a tenner we recieved some pennies back for a 2 pint order erm The pints were good and the staff were excellent talking us through the menu and the changes made to the place Friendly pub that I will head back to in order to experince the food just watch the bar prices some of the items on tap can be a little expensiveI really liked this place as I think theyve pitched themselves just right for an audience that wants good food a relaxed atmosphere and a neighbourhood vibe Ive only been for brunch so I cant comment on its nighttime strengths and weaknessesAround the brunch table was a fine selection of full breakfasts Scotch eggs my duck hash eggssomethingorother and a general hubbub of contented conversation The staff were attentive yet relaxed not too pushy but aware of what was going on They also have a blackboard list of their local suppliers which I think is a nice touch: it means you could recreate your CC experience at home though without the designers filament light bulbs hanging from the ceiling Unless you have them in your house of course Or you live at Cross  CornerFood is always really solid and I enjoy coming here when they have special menus available like their recent Burns Night menu a really nice 4 course meal with a beer tasting for each course for only 2150 I also like their gin cocktails Consistently good restaurant Ill definitely continue to visitNot been down here for a while but felt its well worth a recommendation They do an amazing specials menu every evening which Ive enjoyed on many an occasion Everythings fresh tasty and individual enough so youre feeling youre eating something youd only get there  always something I look for when eating out somewhereTheyve an amazingly long list of great craft beers gins cocktails and artisan roast coffee And they use copper pipes as candleholders Geniussince seeing that this bar had been completely refurbished i was quite keen to try it  so when plans were made to meet here prior to heading to inverleith park to watch the fireworks i was definitely looking forward to finally trying it  however i have to say i was fairly underwhelmedwe arrived a bit early for our 7pm booking but this didnt seem to be a problem as our table was already set and waiting for us  so we grabbed our seats to wait for the rest of the party to arrive and looked over the menu  while the drink menu was fairly substantial i felt like the food menu was lacking a bit  there was a very limited number of starters a few sharing boards and about eight mains four specials and four regular dishes  there was also the option of three sides chips a green salad and something im totally forgettingsince we were still waiting for the rest of our party we decided just to order some drinks and i can confirm that the large red house wine is quite tasty and easy too drink perhaps too easy  when we did order food i got the fish and chips which sounded quite tasty but proved to be just average unfortunately  the best part for me was actually the tartare sauce although the fish was fresh and quite a generous portion  the chips were crispy but since they were sat under the fish a number of them got soggy which is a huge pet peeve to me  ugh soggy chips :  the mushy peas were fairly unremarkable as wellthe service staff were a bit of a mix as well  although they accomodated us sitting at our table early and ordering food at different times none of us found them overly cheerful and im pretty sure one waitress was bordering on being surly  i cant complain too much though as they also let us pay our bill separately at the barso overall just an AOK rating from me  the food was decent but not amazing and i found it was also a bit pricey  however the wine was quite good so id probably head back here for a drinkOnly been in for a drink but pretty decent Good range of wines beers and spirits Managed to get a seat easily enough and wasnt too busy Prices about the same for wine as most places  small wine about 4 mark and good range of options Staff cheery and friendlySo will return if Im in the area Might be sticking to wine though  no prices on the spirits section of the menu when I was in so beware of surprises"

    "review":"I enjoyed my visit to the George Street Bar  Grill the revamped restaurant in the Roxburghe Hotel which opened in August 2013I had good French onion soup followed by tasty beef cheeks It has a good opportunity to establish itself as a reliable favourite but  there are a few places nearby that are ploughing a similar furrow with considerable expertise so they need to get very good very quickly to competeSo overall we said: the George Street Bar  Grill shows signs of promise They have some good value lunch a pretheatre options which will lure people in to give it a try Its problem is that its bounded by Hadrians and Galvins and has the Bonham nearby These are all hotel restaurants that are serving grub to a considerably more impressive standard If you find yourself at the Grill youll be pleased enough but not completely bowledover so I think they have a little work to do to sharpen things upWe looked forward to our meal this evening but were so unhappy with service and ambiance we left after out starter and went elsewhere They were short handed and had didnt have many of the things on the menu The roof was leaking next to our table which kept splashing us All together a disaster save for one redeeming factor A great CosmopolitanOctober 2014: Stumbled upon George Street Bar and Grill one eve while we were walking about  We couldnt decide what sounded the best as we read through all of the other restaurant menus  George Street had lots of options that we decided to give it a goSo glad we did  I have a small olive problem  I love them and I want them constantly and at every restaurant or bar I go into if I see them on the menu  These olives were addicting  They were in a tomatoy garlic infused oil well thats my guess  They were amazing  We ordered them three timesWe ordered risotto for me and filet for him  The risotto was overcooked but flavourful  They realised I wasnt a fan so they took it back  I was happy with the salad I ordered and the olives  I pinched several of his scallops too  He was over the moon about his filet  Couldnt stop chewing and making oh my God faces  Pretty hilariousOur meal was accompanied by prosecco and world class service  Our servers were extremely attentive and helpful even when the dinner rush arrivedWe enjoyed every bit of our 3 hour dinner as did our table neighboursCant wait to partake of the lush food and service again soon George StreetA lot of people dont actually know that there  is a large outdoor area in between the bar and hotel which is good for summertime  I sat at the bar area which is usually not too overcrowded  The waiters were very polite and attentive I ordered the liver mushroom and bacon as starter  Delicately and perfectly cooked liver Most of livers I have tried are just overcooked  My main dish was lamb cutlet  Lamb is usually cooked medium  pink but I think this time they have overcooked it slightly  The crust was also not as flavourful as some of the lamb cutler I have tried  However the beans and potatoes that came with it were perfectly cooked and flavourful My dessert was the rice pudding  I think the ingredients were excellent when paired with the mandarin oranges  The way they prepare the rice pudding was like creme brle with melted sugar at the top of the moulded rice pudding However the rice was on a slightly on the dryer and harder textureCant really fault this place much but maybe some improvement can be done to further enhance the quality of the food  Wouldnt mind coming again to try the other food on their menu"

    "review":"I used to go to The Filling Station as a kid and always thought it was great Once grown up though it doesnt seem as good It is almost a cheap imitation of the likes of Hard Rock Cafe and TGI FridaysThe menu is full of burgers steaks pastas salads and sandwiches We went in one lunch time when they were offering a cheap lunch deal I had fish and chips which were too much like Birds Eye fish and McCains chips for my liking I have been on other occasions and had a burger which I was quite happy so it earns an extra star The service is usually quite quick and friendly which earns it another star Overall there aint much to make this restaurant better than mediocreStaff were nice and friendly when I came here but I wouldnt go again for food and as this one is more of a place to eat than drink unlike the one on the High St I really dont have any reason to try it again I had the worst carbonara Ive ever tasted It reminded me of tinned macaroni which isnt the best either but at least it doesnt set you back seven poundsNot worth coming back I thinkeh I knownOverpriced food and most drinksReason they can survive doing this: they live from oneoff customers who come to visit the cityWould I come back hmm no well noI dont want to say I wouldnt be back because this place is awful Its not its just that there are so many other places that would probably be better deserving of my pounds  So its a Monday morning My husband has decided to go hike Arthurs seat with a friend who ran up it and then came back down to meet him to walk up it Yes That dude did it twice in one day I am a firm believer of knowyourlimitplaywithinit so I went to breakfast with the others instead Wonderful breakfast mates who wanted to shop afterPlace is empty We get seated in a booth and brace ourselves for the Americanness of this place Meh Its a regular restaurant I had the sausage and egg sandwich and an Americano Thats easy One friend got the vegetarian breakfast minus the eggs shes not but was eating healthy to fit in her wedding dress and her hubbytobe got the bacon and egg sandwich with a side of hasbrowns He asked what kind of hashbrowns they had Our server looked at him like he asked what animal chicken eggs come from I could feel the youredumb glare She said they were fried Still didnt explain: we were going more for are they homemade are they potatoes just fried are they packaged I guess she thought we would know what American hashbrowns would be For future they have the disc kind like the ones from McDonalds Deep fried and good My sandwich was okay my sandwich was just sausage and eggs I dont know what I was expecting but its exactly as they say on their menu Its sausages stuffed into a bun with an egg My egg was a little runny which I like It was just ordinary It sufficed the bun was a little sweet which worked well for the sandwichThe place is good enough Kind of expensive for what it isWent to the filling station purely for dessert and got the pecan pie to share The pie was great with a nice apple filling good base and a decent vanilla ice cream to go along As I mentioned we only went for dessert which all looked good but judging by the look of some of the mains coming out of the kitchen I probably wont be back unless its another dessertonly tripMy family and I are here from the states and we stopped in the filling station last night  We really liked everything about it  The selection is much broader than in other restaurants  The food was absolutely wonderful  Mike our waiter was very helpful prompt and nice   Were going back again today and taking the rest of the crew"

    "review":"Sounds like the previous review was written by the owner 5 star this is not On my way home from work the other day I picked up the Culcutta dont know if it was intentionally misspelled Prawn Palak which according to the menu was Steamed cooked prawns with fresh spinach garnished with a touch of garlic and fresh corianderIn reality I got a big brown messIt just tastes of brown and I know thats not very helpful in reviewing terms but Im trying to make a little word picture here All the flavor died somewhere in the cooking process and was replaced by blank mush When i did finally excavate a prawn from the mess it was in no shape to be eaten It practically disintegrated in my mouth Whats stopping this place from getting a 1 star is the rice it was surprisingly goodMy experience of this place wasnt quite a bad as that of the previous reviewers but it definitely wasnt the culinary experience I had hoped for when the flyer came through my door a few months ago  Myself and some mates decided to come here one evening for a curry and the food was pretty disappointing  To their credit the service was friendly and the food didnt take long at all to arrive and the place was cleanFrom the menu they seem to serve just about everything with spinach for some reason Theres nothing wrong with this unless  of course  if you dont like spinach  The starters seemed pretty pricey some of them costing over 6 so we went just went straight for a main  I ordered the balti chicken palak which naturally had spinach and herbs and a plain naan  The chicken was good quality and the naan was nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside  The sauce let the whole side down however  The spinach tasted like it was waterlogged or something and it was like chewing through mushy green straw  Having said this the flavouring of the sauce was actually pretty goodHimalaya is actually quite a good restaurant it just needs a few tweaks to its sauces and a bit less watery spinachI really was not that impressed with the Himalaya Tandoori Restaurant I came here one evening with a few friends for dinner and I was really looking forward to the meal as I had never tasted Himalayan food before but I was disappointed with the experience The menu is impressive with a wide range of authentic dishes and specialities I had the chicken kebab to start which was fine if a little bland but it was well priced at around 4 I then had the chicken Bhuna curry for my main meal which was served in a really watery and runny sauce and the chicken was quite tough and chewy The dishes in the Himalaya Tandoori Restaurant are reasonably priced with most of their curry dishes around 8 and they have a good selection of meals on their vegetarian menu The staff were friendly and efficient and the interior of the restaurant was appealing however I was disappointed with the food  Himalaya Tandoori Restaurant also serve food to take away and do home deliveries which is handyI have been coming to this place since the mid80s and it is definitely consistent At face value this is a local curry house no pretensions of fine dining but good reasonably priced food with attentive service There is little better on a winters night with the freezing wind howling up Bruntsfield Place than to battle through the double doors into a warm and inviting aroma of indian spices  Beware when ordering the naan: they only do these in feed the 5000 sizeMy wife and I ate here twice in the 5 days we spent visiting Edinburgh on our honeymoon and that in itself should tell you its damn good This place wont knock your socks off but the prices are reasonable the service is professional and the food is solid Oh and theres one other thingThe NAANIf youre at all a fan of this Indian bread then you need to go to Himalaya The price is pretty much the same as any other Indian restaurant but the size is anything but The naan portion youll get with a single order is absolutely enormous Easily enough for four people or two really stupid Americans who may be gluttons for punishmentEven if youre not a big naan eater youll still enjoy it here The portions are goodsized too and the food comes out rather quickly Give it a shotWe often get take away from here and have also sat in to eat Really good food the nanns are amazing Lamb green herbs is always tender Delivery always arrives really quickly Would recommend this for either eating in or take away"

    "review":"This was the best steak Ive EVER had in a restaurant I like my steak blue and quite often it just comes rare but at LCH it was still bleeding and absolutely perfect The sides were all fantastic we were in a big party 10 and got lots to share Everyone loved the fact we could go and see the steaks hanging and the staff were all knowledgeable about what was being served The cocktails were fab as well and the whole vibe was of a cool Manhattan cocktail bar We will definitely be going backOne might wonder how a vegetarian managed to end up eating at a steakhouse but the pals were determined to go and who am I to argue I thought it might be interesting to see what there was on offer for me anyway The decor is all concrete and copper and tile and frosted glass which made it LOUD  Id not want one of their tables for two as they looked fairly cramped but our spacious heated booth was grand We had a couple of really delicious cocktails while we waited in the wee bar though my friends two identical cocktails tasted completely different from the first one to the next so some consistency is required behind the bar there The wine list is keenly priced bottles start at 20 and dont go much past the 80 mark and our organic Fiano was a good choice Foodwise my friends adored their steaks and claimed they were cooked exactly as ordered and my token veggie option gnocchi gratin in a mushroomy garlicky cream was fine  small for the price and nothing outstanding but hey folk arent coming here to eat potato dumplings The sides were nicely presented and well executed but thats where they get you at 3 quid a pop and you dont get anything with your meat except a tiny pot of sauce so they really are a necessity Five sides between 3 wasnt really enough either Coffee was good  decent crema on the espresso Nice cups Where we felt a bit cheated was with our postprandial nip of whisky We asked for a list and were told there wasnt one so we went up to the bar to have a look I chose my standard Old Pulteney and my friend picked a 17 yearold Mortlach as wed not tried that one Whiskies drank we got the bill to find that the Mortlach was 15 quid a dram At no point could we see prices nor were we told at the bar when we ordered that this was a premium spirit Kind of a dampener on the end of a good night Service was efficient and friendly if a little slow They had a large party and were totally full on a Tuesday night though so the three of them did a grand job considering We were busy chatting and drinking wine anyway and they had offered us bread while we waited which we turned downAll in all if youre a steak lover youll like this place Come with a group of friends Order a few bottles from the cheap end of the list Share all the sides Dont bother with anything that isnt a steak I wont be back but will happily recommend it to those I know would appreciate itHad dinner here tonight with three friends Really lively atmosphere and the bar was really busy They are still very new so lots of people in to check it out Service was friendly good selection of meat and seafood Im assured the burger was amazing The steaks were all well cooked My bone marrow gravy was delicious The sides we had were all tasty if portions a tad small The kimchi slaw was about a heaped tablespoon rather pricey at 350Good cocktail menu I had a whisky cocktail with bee pollen and honey They have the meat aging in a fridge which you can go and look at My only complaint was that it was incredibly loud With very on trend minimalist decor there was nothing to absorb the noise at the bar We all felt like we were yelling to be heard at our table of four Decided to go for a drink elsewhere so we didnt end up hoarse tomorrowWe had not intended to go to a steak bar for dinner Still it was to be expected: wed went for a wander on empty stomaches with cause for celebrationWe walked from Stockbridge to Leith and wound up at Leith Chop House Its modern and atmospheric sharp and slick Looking through the windows from the street we were curious It looked mysterious and that in itself was enough to lead us insideStaff were friendly and welcoming and we felt attended to I really enjoyed the music it was really funky and energetic a mix of funk and soul Maybe just a teeny tiny bit too loud to comfortably talk over But still the atmosphere was a lively one and it wasnt a huge problemNow how was the meat I hear you cry Pretty damn good We went for the burgers which came with such juicy seasonedtoperfection meat Id say that this was one of the best burgers Ive had in that respect And no doubt great meat is a necessity for a great burger It was a simple offering no house sauce no frills  Just lettuce tomato and cheese But simple can be wonderful and this was a fine fine burger regardlessI loved the chips proper chunky chips  Again with strong seasoning game I foresee steak at Leith Chop House soonBeen 3 times now and they are clearly finding their feet more steadily as time passes The first time was not great in all aspects about 3 weeks after opening but friends wanted to visit over next few months so went along too to see if improvements had been made and they have for the most partIts really nice inside and my first overwhelming impression was it was mega styleoversubstance because the first visit was underwhelming I have felt the same way about Montieths same guys for years until recently so it feels like their priorities are a bit skewiffy A nice interior does not make up for a 70 dinner for 2 2 steaks and sides 2 lg wines as happened our first visit when the food was really not that great Love the loos  Each time weve been the macncheese side has been slightly better 350 for a tiny ramekin so it should be excellent soon The straw fries all sides are 350 actually just get cold and unpleasant too fast Starters hit and miss in general The steaks look and sound impressive though the blackboard of cuts available has had scores through most of the available sizes every time weve been so lots of availability issues Between us weve had 2 average steaks one fabulous and one overcooked but still delicious All that said lunch is a steal Brunch is good and a great additional offering to have in Leith There are lots of nice wine options but they really hike up your final bill total Not cheap We had good cocktails too but theyre also not cheap Actually the designated overstylish bar area seems sadly underused Got the impression only big beard people are allowed thereId not be able to give it 5 until the service changes The servers are pleasant enough but the mammoth spiel they have to give each table is just out of control tedious and unnecessary Obviously if youve been before they wont do it but as we went with new people each time we gathered over 10 opinions that were the same as ours It borders on patronising and there is just no need for all the overexplaining Worst thing is that after youve had your sermon you can hear it again all over the place at other tables the whole time youre there I wonder why this has not been streamlined yet Ive never seen anything like itOne other tiny niggle  the owners or one of them areis always there taking up a table to do some sort of paperwork Obviously an owner SHOULD be keeping an eye on a new venture but I think its a shame they are never seen helping out answering the phone checking the food getting to know their customers giving their business a face etc Its the sort of thing Leithers love but hey hoIve been to Leith Chop House a couple of times  twice for dinner and once for a wine tastingTonight I dined there again Last time I had steak  this time I wanted to try their burger as I heard good things about them The burger was just a simple 300g steak burger with cheddar cheese and pickles It was served with a brioche bun Simple but good food In fact it was the best burger I have ever had I never wanted that burger to end But it eventually did and the plate was clear The burger was so juicy and perfect that I couldnt fault it in any way Simple food but done really well Mondays and Tuesdays are BYOB 5 corkage"

    "review":"Service here was pleasant throughout my evening visit on November 2nd We were greeted and seated promptly easily done as we were the sole customers at the back of 5 and left for a reasonable amount of time to make our choices As suggested by our server the fattoush salad was ample between two and the falafals we ordered as an accompaniment were well sized and not over cooked Id like to go back and see how much tea is served when you order it just for one as 7 for two lots of mint tea for two amounting to 3 cups each seemed rather steep as did the 4 for 4 admittedly very tasty baklawa to round things off My companion and I unfortunately became invisible at bill time and then had to advise that the one wed been presented with was the wrong one This place has potential but glitches such as these need to be worked out if its to do well especially in the current economic climateFood was alright but the service breaks under pressure We went for a great night out the celebrate a birthday and had to wait our whole meal for water Come to the end of the meal and we were given dessert menus wanted to get shisha and they kicked us out saying they needed the space for more customersVery weakMade a reservation and went on a fairly quiet weekday evening for dinner with a group I believe that we got a selection for 4 people for 5 of us and it was way more than enough food would easily feed 6 We were actually disgustingly full even after the starter but it was so very delicious that we felt compelled to finish our meal Subscribed to the email list prior to our visit to get a 20 discount voucher BYOB Great ambiance but bit darkwould be good for dates tooEigentlich wollten wir in ein anderes Restaurant dass leider geschlossen hatte Dadurch sind wir ber das Beirut gestolpert Wir hatten Humus und Falafel als Vorspeise vegetarischer Eintopf und eine Humusplatte als Hauptgleise Es war sehr gut alles hat so gut geschmeckt Der Service war unheimlich nett SOrdered from Just Eat Ordered the Falafel main and got a starter and it was burnt to the crisp and seemed to be old and off Just Eat contacted the restaurant and they agreed to send the driver back with a refund Now 3 hours later theres still no sign of them and Just Eat have reminded them already about an hour ago This isnt the first time Ive had a poor experience with this restaurant previously theyve ignored any instructions about dietary requirements but decided to give them another go Never againI was in Tate Modern in that London fairly recently Now Im not big on modern art or art in general but there was one installation that really riled me Basically it was a collection of little leather cubes arranged in a supposed random way And the sign read er yah its like a metaphor for the banality of existence and the arbitrariness of prejudice Yeah ok Just looks like leather cubes to meThe reason Im telling you this is that horrible memory came back to me in Beirut My main course was Lebanese lamb with chips I swear they stole that installation from Tate and served it to me It was so overcooked it was almost impossible to eat My dining partner had basically the same but with beef which was equally overdone The pickles we shared for starter were from a jar In fact the only good point was the sausages which were nicely spiced if a little saltyIts a real shame because theyve made an effort with this place The staff were friendly if a little inefficient the guy next to us got his main at the same time as his starter and its nicely done out Its just the food was awful Maybe I had a bad experience but I dont want to risk going back"

    "review":"La Petit Mort just seemed to look like one of those snug romantic little places to tuck yourself away with someone and have a lovely few hours with Which is exactly what I did catching up with a good friend The great thing  you are not rushed out of the door at any point and can spend as little or as long as you want to there I would say something cheesy like JAdore Petit Mort but that just sounds plain weird so lets notI decided to go all in and have the parsnip brulee to start This was the only bum note of the evening as part of the brulee was warm part was stone cold and it didnt really feel right to be so cold even with our hostess insisting that was right Im guessing it sat under a heater which made it a little odd even though technically the flavours were great I was left feeling a little disconcerted For the mains my dining partner opted for the venison while I went for the smoked bean chilli Now Id had chilli for lunch too so it did feel like I was going to be underwhelmed by my main through sheer repetitiveness but the dish was fantastic beats the canteen version all day every day and I enjoyed every mouthful Sadly though I was too full to eat anything more and I had been really looking forward to trying the desserts out specifically the Raspberry Bavarois However my friend was wise and had skipped a starter in order to make sure there was room for dessert opting for the Assiette of Chocolate  which I was allowed to sample with care of course Rich decadent a splendid way to finish the night and we rolled off into the September evening our bellies full and our hearts happy Ill be back for the Raspberry Bavarois another dayLa Petite Mort is ideal for date night in Edinburgh The prices are reasonable the space is inviting and the staff are friendly and really know their stuff The food is delicious: fine dining at a reasonable price There are only three starters five mains and three desserts to choose from but I still found it difficult to settle on what to eat Everything sounds so good The drinks menu is similarly well put together with some lovely sounding cocktails and loads of great bottles of wineAs part of a surprise birthday dinner we were indeed pleasantly surprised to be seated at la Petit Mort There was a really warm welcome and we were very well taken care of The girl serving us was extremely knowledgeable and could explain drinks and dishes to the finest detail including little enticing morsels of flavour explanations They serve a menu of 3 starter mains and desserts The highlight for myself was indeed the rare cooked flat iron steak Perfectly cooked and extremely tender Their cocktail list is a joy to readThey do offer a large range of classic cocktails made to measure and personal preferences I was very pleased with my earl grey old fashioned though I personally prefer the single large rock of iceMy biggest surprise was how reasonable the prices are compared to other places of similar quality Kitchin Scan  Scally et al The food and service is certainly up to par Sure these other places have won awards but I did experience a similar if not BETTER experience in la Petit Mort  and as they are just starting out they may collect their rewards later on Highly recommended and certainly worthy of revisiting often"

    "review":"I first visited Ciao Roma over a year ago with my family and we have been there for regular meals ever since testimony to both the quality of the food and the general experience  The service strikes that unique balance between being funny and friendly but without being irritatingly overconcerned for your welfare  The food is consistent with a wide variety of hot and cold starters great pasta dishes pizzas and other authentic Italian mains  I usually have the penne della nonna a pasta dish with a spicy sausage and tomato sauce whilst my sister and mum regulary enjoy their ecclectic selection of pizzas  My dad however ordered a pizza with jalapenos sausage and anchovies the last time we were there describing it as a wierd combination upon eating it   probably an acquired taste  Nevertheless the food is reasonably priced with most mains hovering around the 910 pound mark and being delicious when they arrive  The restaurant is familyrun in a great location and has an unusually inviting atmosphere making it well worth a look if youre in the area  You just might want to avoid any obscure pizzas lurking on the menuI have to confess Im still on a hunt for that perfect local Italian restaurant that everyone has  the one you go to when you cant be bothered to cook but cant justify going out for a swanky meal or just where you go because you know its always so goodAlthough I havent found it yet in Edinburgh Ciao Roma is definitely leading the pack after 4 years of living here I ate here for a friends birthday recently and Id absolutely recommend itFor one thing the service was excellent You got the impression from the efficiency of it that they are used to handling big groups of girls with copious amounts of wine and yet they were also very patient with us and didnt rush us at all The menu isnt just the usual tired pizzapasta list that you so often see obviously they do offer all of these things but what struck me was how many risotto dishes on offer as well and chickensteakbased dishes I went for a risotto with scallops brandy a good helping of garlic and roast peppers 995 and it really was lovelyThe only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is the price of the house wine although it wasnt by any means extortionate it was more than youd expect in a cheapandcheerful italian That said if youre looking for an Italian place in this neck of the woods then you could do an awful lot worse than go hereI have been going to Ciao Roma for years to this one and the other branch in PerthThe service is always great the staff are helpful and good at recommending dishes It is good for a girly lunch or an evening meal The menu is quite extensive and includes the usual pizza and pasta as well as salads chicken dishes seafood steak and risotto There is a good choice of starters as well my problem is I can never decide what to have because everything looks so good The pizzas are tasty with delicious crispy crust I also have enjoyed a sausage pasta dish and the gnocchi here I never manage to finish though as the portions are quite generous Great little Italian offering a wide range of delicious dishes at very good pricesAround Southbridge can seem like Italian restaurant central However this isnt a bad thing at all Edinburgh might not be as well known for its Italians compared to the likes of Glasgow but it still has a few gems They might not be world renowned but some remain very memorable Keep this in mind when you visit Ciao RomaCiao Roma is decorated in a pseudo classical motif Roman statues and figures adorn the walls and corners of this large restaurant Whilst not original this theme does give the restaurant a distinct aesthetic if not somewhat taken away by some more out of place paintings and wall decorations Despite its size Ciao Roma is a touch crowded with a lot of tables packed in This reveals what is at its heart a reasonable family friendly unpretentious restaurantThe staff are typically not only friendly but carry a chatty Italian charm Its sometimes hard to tell whether they are genuine or if they are in fact displaying well develop stage personasOne of the restaraunts greatest charms is the upper level called the Hispania This part of the restaraunt is no different in what its serves but is decorated differently Instead of the naked classical forms displayed in the main part this section of the restaurant has a sevenseas 18thc century pirate theme presumably Spanish Its really quite odd but all the better for it Pirate skeletons sit at tables and gazing sinisterly over the land lubber diners Hanging up above you notice a cage imprisoned inside another skeleton peering down This is clearly a favourite for children and those with child at heartKeeping with its less flashy feel Ciao Roma sells Italian standards with a range of pasta and pizzas as well as a few more original dishes Prices are reasonable and a student discount is offeredA distinct restaurant great for a family meal student treat or just for some comforting Italian foodI Love Ciao Roma I have been coming here for years with my family and most recently came here last month for my graduation meal There is always a really great atmosphere inside the restaurant with really authentic Italian decor inside and Italian music playing in the background Ciao Romas menu offers a huge selection of authentic Italian meals including pizzas pastas risotto and meat dishes I really adore their pizzas as they have a super thin base that is always perfectly cooked with no burnt bits and they are a really good size and will fill you up They offer a huge selection of different pizza toppings and they dont skimp on the toppings or cheese which is always a bonus The last time I came here I ordered a pasta dish gnocchi with pesto and asparagus and it was utterly beautiful  really well cooked and there was plenty of it but not too much to make you feel stodgy Ciao Roma also serves delicious starters their roasted peppers are especially amazing and their desert menu looks very mouth watering and enticing The prices are really reasonable here with most main meals costing around 8 The staff are all Italian and highly friendly and welcoming If you are in the mood for a great Italian meal Ciao Roma is the place to goAdmittedly we were here during the Festival so service and quality is not expected to be high This place is simply a place for people who never have decent Italian food and are happy with something in the neighborhood of Italian Id suggest a tattie or chips in a local pub for your money"

    "review":"Fun creative African food restaurantThis place is furnished with Ethiopianstyle booths and offers an interesting range of authentic dishes and African twists of Scottish ones We went for a shared plate of the Masai Mara Meat platter and it was delicious: plentiful portions of lamb sausage steak and other meats complemented with kachumbari a yoghurt sauce and a guave fennel and apple salade we added onAn interesting wine and beer Nigerian Guinness list and a selection of their homemade desserts complete the settingDefinitely worth itI went here for brunch or what I call brunch on a Sunday morning They advertise to open at 11am but it opened about 10 minutes late We were seated and offered menus  then some more tables came in  with only one server  so our order was eventually taken I wasnt in a hurry so didnt mind  the girl working was nice but the coffees we ordered were delayed due to other tables coming in My friend and I ordered the spiced coffee which was lovely We both also got the veggie breakfast platter which had tomatoes avocado fried aubergine friend plantain an egg and sauted kale with two pieces of toast All were delicious especially the kale which was garlicky and delicious I tried several flavour combinations and found the aubergine and plantain to be the best We also decided to share the corn and cinnamon pancakes It personally was not for me  sweet and topped with plantain  I think it would be better savoury Together it was 22 for the 3 plates and 2 coffees I enjoyed the wee place and the tasty veggie breakfast  would definitely recommend it for a lazy morningI definitely enjoyed my lunch at Knights Kitchen Passing by one day with a friend we decided to give it a try for lunch as the menu looks very enticing indeed I went for a curry of the day which was chicken and coconut and my friend had a hearty breakfast with a lot of different meats The food didnt disappoint The curry was spicier than I expected but very tasty indeed and my friends breakfast went down a treat washed down with a tea in his caseThe place was nicely decorated and we sat in a cool booth It was also quiet which surprised me as it seems like an ideal location for a lunch place Value is pretty good the food is great and we dealt with a friendly staff member All I would say is that more comfortable seats would be appreciated Will be backAwesome staff unusual and tasty food all the makings of amazing Its an African inspired selection with the history of where the chef found some of the dishes and the African names of them And plantains I havent had them since I was last home in Cali where you can visit Little Chihuahua for a plantain and black bean burrito mmm or any tapas place for a plate of plantains They were great and such a treat alongside eggs and bacon and avocado and tomato relish and chard As a side note the bathroom has a newsletter pasted to the door to read as you are seated and it is flash stories It was awesome to see something new and local and it was an inspiring change from what I expectedKnights Kitchen had been repeatedly recommended by a friend thats why I decided to look for it Honestly I really had to attentively look for it since the place is very tiny just a small glass and a door facing the road and an inconspicuous wooden panel On the other hand the interior is an explosion of colours and tribal music perfectly coherent with the choice of food mainly of African inspiration I went for a vegetarian sandwich which consisted of a toasted kind of ciabatta bread topped with avocado fried plantain spinach tomatoes and tomato sauce There were also a few fancy salads as sides Struck by how good the fried plantain was I also got their plantain and ginger cake as dessert Both the courses were extraordinary I was so disappointed to feel full I really wanted to have lunch again after lunch By the way it was also less expensive than I had thought just 10 for the whole meal"

    "review":"Good beer at reasonable prices considering its so close to the Royal Mile Great haggis too I dont know why so many previous reviewers have slated the staff Ive always found them polite and helpfulThe Advocate is another if these Edinburgh pubs with a history which they kindly provide you with on the menu Its something to do with an advocate thats all I rememberThis pub is very pub like Quite cosy and good for an afternoon of munch and drink They have a thing about sausages here they often have different flavours so we opted for sausage and mash It was quite delicious a large portion and very filling A reasonable pub lunch price too Not as overpriced as other Royal Mile area bars and the staff are very chatty and friendlyAs Worlds End was closed for refurbishment this place serves a similar fantastic fishnchipsThe Advocate is located in Hunter Square right near the junction between the Royal Mile and South  North Bridge  Its a place Ive only been to once for drinks and I cant say that I was blown away by what it offered  We were in there on a fairly quiet weekday evening and the atmosphere was pleasant enough  Drinks were of a reasonable price and I would have totally got some food if I hadnt already eaten that evening  Two evening meals would have been a little excessiveAnyway this place isnt really on my radar now as a place for going out for a drink to  I cant really comment on the alcohol beverages on offer as Im not a drinker but everyone else I was with seemed to get on just fineIts not a hotspot for a night out but still well worth a look inJust over the road form the Tron you couldnt have two pubs that were more different from each other Unlike the student party like atmosphere at the Tron the Advocate has got that slight old man traditional feel But seeing as not many old people or any people really come in here it has almost no atmosphere whatsoever To be frank its pretty boring Ive been in there a few times and each time it has been really quiet and you feel awkward talking in case you disturb the perfectly preserved silence Its not a great feel for a pub to haveThe inside is quite nice though with a few little nooks and crannies to hide away in There is a big old traditional bar selling all the normal drinks at pretty average prices They used to do a student discount but that no longer is the case I havent had the food but I would assume it is very much like the rest of the pub  dullWas here late Saturday afternoonearly evening during a Wales v Ireland rugby game The ambience was great: jocular and enthusiastic without being rowdy or noisy A great option if you fancy keeping track of the match but also want to enjoy a bit of quiet chatbanter with your friends The pub itself is delightful a mix of booth seats cosy corners and high tables with stools warm lighting in fascinating light hangings and walls papered with sheet music and gentle unimposing red tartan There is a wide selection of real ales I had a Raven Ale from the Orkneys and a good whiskey selection The food is also delicious  standard pub grub burgers and what not but well prepared tasty and served with a smile to your table A good option if you find yourself in the Royal MileNorth Bridge area"

    "review":"A great tiny place with no more than 10 tables so Id recommend making reservations  Although if you can wait simply jaunt across the street to the Peartree for a pint and theyll give you a jingle when a table is upIts philosophy is farm to table with local Scottish ingredients with the result of good food  The menu isnt vast unsurprisingly but each item seemed appealing  Its a very romantic spot and a nice change from a Haggis burgerAbsolutely beautiful food lovely staff and very underpriced for the quality you get Its very small so you must book ahead but its well worth a planned visit An easy 15 minute walk from Waverley station and some of the best food Ive ever hadQuaint little restaurant in Edinburgh The food is fresh and delicious The prices are reasonable They change their menu frequently so its worth going more than once A great place for dinner if you fancy eating out on a weekday with friendscolleagues Its a small restaurant so Id recommend booking a tableEasily the best meal Ive had while traveling in the UK Their approach on their website says it all  Michelin quality in an easy approachable manner We did the seared scallops as a starter and then had the duck and pork belly as mains Everything was incredible and delicious Approachable wine list and very friendly waitstaff If and when Im back in Scotland Id love to come here againA wonderful meal Small cosy restaurant with excellent service Food was spectacular Locally sourced ingredients and simple elegant preparation allows the flavours to shine through Highly recommendedThis is hands down one of the best dining experiences Ive ever had My wife and I enjoyed a tremendous 3course meal each course better than the last They took excellent care of my wifes nut allergy and my own gluten sensitivity Amazing service and wait staff I cant imagine that there exists a better restaurant in all of Edinburgh"

    "review":"Fantastic Spanish deli in StockbridgeI tried some of their produce at a Spanish Tourism Board event in October and it was beautiful and amazing qualityThere is a fabulous jamon retails for about 12 for 100g but it is amazing I tried lots of this :Lots of deli items available  chorizo black pudding gluten free cheeses plus tinsjars of Spanish products such as tortilla filling white asparagus olives and more Decent wine selection and now you can match your deli lunch with wine tooMy office mate swears by the quality of the produce here  hes Spanish and knows the regional products here are the real deal The staff are brilliant and will give advice on the best way to cookserve things It isnt the cheapest place but it is worth paying for the quality of the produce available here A new favourite :Really excellent Spanish Delicatessen  Everything I have had from here has been delicious the ham superb the cheese great the sherry awesome ad nauseam There just is nothing bad to be bought here  The couple that own it are also lovely  So in summary BRILLIANTThere are plenty delis in Edinburgh offering authentic Spanish products but none ive been to can match the uniquely Spanish produce available at Goya 23 Or the super friendly staffThere isnt a huge amount of products for sale yet but what they do sell will be a treat for any Hispanophile Theres various charcuterie tins of seafood pate paella and stews kits wine snacks and some chocolate as wellThey offer a menu of salads and sandwiches to sit in or take away all with an impressive looking Spanish flavour that I am keen to return to tryThe highlight of my visit being the Iberian pork loins something that I havent seen in any shop in the UK beforeIts a great addition to StockbridgeEdinburgh and somewhere ill probably spend too much money but without regret"

    "review":"Went here on a Sunday night and the place was fairly dead We were with a group of 6 so that didnt matter too much The menu just made my mouth water everything sounded delicious When the waitress came to attend our table she asked if we had bottles with us Slightly confused as we werent aware that it was a BYOB restaurant No bother though one of us went to the shop for some nearby wine Even though it wasnt busy at all the waitress was a bit slow with attending our table She also didnt mention that there wasnt any lamb shank and monkfish that day before we made our order This is a bit inattentive since she had plenty of opportunity to let us know about thisAfter we placed our order she offered to bring some poppadums which then took a wee while again for these to be brought overThe starter and mains arrived and were absolutely amazing 45 stars for the food for me Very fragrant flavoursome beautiful plate arrangement Unlike any other Indian restaurant I have been to The mains were cleared and the waitress ignored us for the rest of the night A big table of 10 arrived but apart from that we were the only table in the restaurant We werent offered the dessert card or coffees We paid the bill and went our waysIf we would have been served normally this restaurant could have been 4 stars even 5 stars if the service would have been excellent Now Im in between 2 and 3 stars because I felt very let down because of the serviceThis Indian place is delicious We had lamb saag and chicken from Goa The starter of fried something with chutney pickled onions and mango sauce was delish Bring your own wine"

    "review":"The place hasnt been open very long but I think its going to be around for a while if it carries on the way its been goingIts unashamedly Scottish but not in a tacky way: they promise hearty scottish fare and premium drams and yet rather than being a cheap tourist trap this place still retains an upmarket feelWhich brings me to my one grumble: the price With such a great location just at the west end of Princes Street and offering service to such a high standard inevitably the drinks arent cheap But its definitely worth it this has fast become one of my favourite drinking spots in the city centreHere on vacation Not real friendlyI guess we where the tourists Beers too expensive compared to the pubs Food too salty Not a great experience They out a reserved sign on the table at 6:30 to reserve the table for 7:30 Did not tell us we had to move 12 the table showed at 7:44 Not really sure what that was about Will not visit next roundStopped in for a quick lunch with family their first meal in Edinburgh Was delighted by the ambiance drink selection and friendly waitstaff but unfortunately our food orders didnt stand up to such quality I ordered the goat cheese salad which in theory was delicious but lacked substance  barely any leaves to the salad Others ordered fish  chips too greasy mushroom and bacon pasta was bland and lacked originality simply tasted of cream needed a little something extra like garlic or parmesan Giving Ghillie Dhu 3 stars though because of the steak and ghillie pie that was cooked tenderly and deliciouslyThis rating is overall based on all the times Ive been to Ghillie Dhu Because based on today it would only be one or two The quality of the food itself is great and the drinks are tasty and reasonablypriced but its the service that varies a lot Today I went in to have a drink and a snack with a friend before catching my train We each has a glass of wine and two sides just to munch while we drank and chatted The mac and cheese side was delicious albeit smaller than expected but we didnt quite get the other side that we ordered We asked for chips with garlic mayo the server took our order and eventually came back with chips and a coleslaw I asked where the garlic mayo was and was told Oh Im sorry we are out of mayo today Excuse me Then tell me that when I order because I hate coleslaw We might have ordered something else had we known Then later on we asked for the bill right as another server cleared the plates because it was starting to cut close to my train time12 minutes passed and no bill I had to go up to the bar to ask for it It wasnt a super busy time I was there late Sunday afternoon Maybe it was just a bad day This is not to deter you from going to Ghillie Dhu The place inside is gorgeous especially the upstairs hall And its always fun for a dinner or after work drink Just dont expect consistency with the serviceFood was good service was a bit slow but that may have been the tours idea and not the restaurant  Bathroom only had one functioning sink out of six which if you follow baseball is a crap batting averageBar had decent prices and the dancing was quite entertaining That being said I dont think I would have gone here unless it had been included in the tour itineraryOne of the things Ive liked most about Edinburgh so far is how nice all the people are With all the tourists me included wandering around bring stupid youd really think they had an excuse to be mean But no and the staff at Ghillie Dhu are no exception We had a fixed menu for our large tour group  choices of soup chicken liver or haggis for an app plaice chicken or a veggie Wellington for entree and several types of dessert The tomato and lentil soup was perfectly ok although not terribly distinctive We sampled my uncles brave haggis choice which was surprisingly tasty especially the whiskey gravy  mmmm The entrees were alright  the plaice surrounded a smoked salmon interior and had a cream sauce but it lacked oomph and spices The mashed potatoes were pretty delicious though We had a Drambuie soaked sponge cake and a clotted cream thing with raspberries for dessert The sponge was served in a fun little chocolate shell and the raspberries were very fresh However I dont know how anybody could seriously eat what amounted to a whole cupful of clotted cream Even me and I love that stuff Anyhow the food was a little slow in coming out but the servers were very nice and accommodating"

    "review":"This is a kebab shop located on a street full of similar shops and although you can tell by looking at the kebab meat spinning even during closed hours this will not be one of those greasy yet satisfying mealsHowever my desire for greasy got the better of me and I ate here once The meat was really dry but fatty at the same time never knew that was possible It confuses me how there are always people in here eating Maybe I dont know the house specialThere are so many kebab shops in this area of Edinburgh it really suprises me that this place is always doing business The food is greasy takes forever to get expensive for what it is and lacks so much flavour that even the chilli sauce on the kebabs doesnt really do much for the taste buds Why two stars and not one then Well it would have to be for the fact that this place has a sitting area  and after a heavy night of drinking when bed isnt the best idea yet its nice to sit somehwere to eat your nasty kebabWith so many other places like this on Nicholson Street I would avoid this place unless I absolutly had toIve never eaten a kebab in my life that I can remember so I couldnt comment on Marmaris kebabmaking abilities I do however have a fair amount of knowledge and expertise when it comes to their pizzasyes theyre greasy full of salt overpriced and you usually eat them out of a cardboard box But by definition if Im getting one then it means Im not sober enough to be bothered by any of those things and as far as drunken thumbsups go Marmaris definitely gets oneHowever I wasnt lying when I said it was overpriced Especially when theres th beautiful and amazing Palmyra literally 30 seconds walk along the street Its just that Marmaris is closer to my flat and so on those occasions when getting dropped off somewhere by the taxi which is a still open for hot food at 2am and b walkinginheels distance from home this place usually trumps itUnlike the previous reviewers Ive never had the pleasure of eating in Marmaris whilst drunk as it never seems to be open at that time  I have however eaten in it with my mates late one night whilst sober and as the threestar caption suggests it was AOK  The place specialises in kebabs and always has multiple fatsoaked doner and chicken kebabs spinning round behind the counter  I had a doner with salad and chili sauce which cost about 4  This was actually pretty pricey considering how bad and dry it tasted and how long it took to arrive  My mate ordered a pepperoni pizza and spent a few mintues mopping up all the grease on top of it with napkins before he tucked in  The service is nice enough and theres plenty of seating which is good because trust me youll have to wait  Marmaris isnt top of my list for kebab houses especially when there is far superior competition in the areaIf you are a lover of anything greasy I would recommend Marmaris which is one of those comfort take out restaurants on Clerk StreetI will give them the benefit of the doubt and hope not all their dishes are accompanied with a lot of oil as Ive only had a pizzas from there Its important to add its usually after a night out when a lot of things will taste good and I havent had much to complain aboutThe menu is quite cheap but apart from a friendly chat with the nice staff this place is just alrightI use to get decent pizza here Unfortunately this isnt the case nowAbout a year ago the really did serve up the best pizza in town their pizza sauce cheese and the rest of their ingredients were of a very high quality Fast forward a year and its very different nothing tastes like it was Even the salad sauce tastes watered down Anyway I went last night to see if anything had changed and it hadnt and they got my order wrong Unfortunately they have now lost me as a customer and I wont be returning Turkish kebab house on Easter road do incredible pizzas"

    "review":"Oh so yummy I had the pork gyro for 4 pounds and my boyfriend has the pork gyro plate for 7 pounds Definitely will be coming back The price and the food was exactly what Ive been looking for in Edinburgh Nice staff and clean even have a carafe of Tap water Thank you for a yummy lunchTheir food is still good and authentic but I have to pay extra for tzatziki yougurt sauce in my gyros Given the prices of the place they should include it like every greek place does or even raise the price of it but not charge us an extra for it thats a joke and a bad one At least they fixed the option to add tzatziki sauce in the gyros ithrough online delivery via deliveroo because initially we had to call them each time to add it at the order and the staff was giving us attitude because the charge had already been made online not our fault thoughAnd finally its here The first original Greek souvlaki in Edinburgh has opened   I was long wondering why in a city with so many Greeks and so many kebabs there was no place with real gyrossouvlaki And I am glad now there is The pita gyros portion is very big enough to get you full with only one The pork gyros is yummy and the hole souvlaki is definitely original as it tastes in Greece Plus they have Greek products as the Green cola a nice stevia alternative to coca cola I wait for them to start delivering to get a 5 from me as they are a bit far from the city centre I also wish they add more tzatziki in the pitas for take outAn original Greek souvlaki pork skewer and mpifteki beef mince meat with herbsWith homemade fries Tzatziki garlic yoghurt salad and other Greek dishes And some original Greek soft drinks and the famous Greek pitta bread Oh yes I was looking forward to trying out this place Things I wasnt impressed with: on the souvlaki portion three pork skeweres pitta bread some chopped tomatoes and onions along with chips there was no tzatziki Come on you guys are all Greek in there and you should now that these things go together No alcohol served at least for now On my 2nd visit the service was good and punctual around 67 people working in it Its not an actual restaurant its closer to a kebab place I would say but believe me you need to try it at least once Now about my first visit Well it was on the 2nd day they opened three people only working there people standing in the queue waiting to order and giving up after 15 minutes or so I was lucky enough to find a sit while my persistent friend was standing right on the cashier to give an order: it took 35 mins to just give the order and another 15 mins to be served We were not happy at all but we were hungry and wanted badly to try their food Will I go back Yes assuming theres no big queue"

    "review":"Pizza Factory is a huge industrial complex that pumps out a constant supply that makes up 75 of the worlds pizzas Actually its a small takeaway pizza joint but it does feel mass producedIm not a huge fan of Pizza Factory but I think I can understand why it is popular There really is a huge range of toppings that you can create your own pizza with by create your own they mean select each ingredient  you want on the pizza at 70p each You can choose from the usual mushroom and peperoni to the more interesting like feta or walnuts This did allow me as a vegetarian to be a bit more picky After all out of their set pizzas I think there was only one vegetarian option the ColosseumMost set pizzas cost 660 I find this a little steep as for not much more you could visit a pretty great Italian restaurant But nevertheless the quality of pizzas here really isnt half bad Im not a fan of takeaways in general but I do prefer pizza Theres something a bit harder to fake in a veggie pizza unlike an anonymous kebab If you feel the same way then maybe Pizza Factory is worth a visitI like this place because of the massive variety of toppings you cna have on your pizza Chilli beef Roman artichokes smoked pork sausage feta cheese and walnuts strange things that youve never tried but but mustThe prices are amazing too we got a 16 inch for under 11 which fed like 5 of us It took a little while to cook but thats because they made it freshThis place cant be beatThis is a pretty cool pizza joint with a good selection of pizzas and a wide range of toppings I have a close friend who lives 5 minutes down the road from here so quite often popped in just before or after seeing themThe pizzas here are not quite to the quality of Dominos or Pizza Hut but a lot closer to that quality than they are from your standard greasy pizza place but at really great pricesThey do some pretty good student deals here if I was getting a pizza on my own I opted for a large twelve inch pizza with four toppings which was 6 or if I was sharing I got an eighteen inch pizza with four toppings which is very reasonably prices at 1050 just over a fiver each which offers good value for moneyThis little place really surprised me To be honest I wasnt expecting much when I ventured in but I was in the area and was in that mood where I would have seriously considered committing major crimes to get a pizza Lo and behold I came across this ol joint looks like serendipity had my back I was wary at first but through caution to the winds and ordered if my memory serves me correctly a meaty beast of a pizza with a token amount of onions so I can persuade myself I had a healthy intake of veg Hey with the tomato pure on there thats almost two of my five a day Couple that with the apples in the cider Id had in the pub earlier and I was feeling pretty healthy to be honest The pizza when it eventually came smelled awesome and upon taking it home and devouring it was not disappointed All the ingredients complemented each other well  Im not going to take credit for this the guy there did give me advice on which things to mix and which to avoid  and I was stuffed well before finishing it For the price about 7 or 8 it was excellent value and tasted almost as good again when I unashamedly rocked the old student clich and reheated it for breakfast A good find"

    "review":"My partner and I were pointed in the direction of Ricks from a bouncer around the corner at The Opal Lounge who had politely informed us that we were 2 years late for dinner service there We walked in and both thought yeah just what we are looking for It had that cosy feel but with a buzz from music and people having fun it was a Fri night We were going to be seated next to the door but asked if we could have something further back and she took us to the conservatory The smell of mint from the frehlymade mojitos hit us as we walked through and whet our appetite for a cocktail from the very long selection list and both were happy with our choices On to the food to start I had the butternut squash  ginger soup and my GF had the mussels Both were very good and very decent portion sizes A glass of house red each next with our mains and I dont know if they accidentally gave us red from the wrong bottle but it was absolutely delicious For mains I had the rack of lamb with mushroom rosti both were excellent and the lamb was cooked perfectly if not slightly fatty GF had panfriend sea bass on a bed of scallopking prawn risotto and we both agreed that this was one of the best risottos wed ever had After these considerable portions there was no space for desert We were also delighted to find out that our mains were BOGOF and the total bill came to a reasonable 50  tips Staff were friendlyA nice experienceIn the last 6 months Ricks has definitely had a good shake up and after my fantastic experience last week I think things can only get better The bar team are innovative and original and during a busy Friday night shift never failed to impress me as I worked my way through the new cocktail list And the bar snacks were unique and delicious The DJ provides a funky relaxed atmosphere and gradually builds up the beats to get you in that weekend mood I will be back again and again and will be taking all my friends too I recommend a passionfruit frozen margarita or busy with the fizzy strawberry soda stream cocktail Just fabTwo friends and I had lunch here today my second time visiting They took advantage of the 2 mains for 10 deal while I had the leek and gruyere tartletyum We ate outside in the intermittent sun and my tartlet was gooey and hot and decadent without being at all heavy It came with a little pile of sticky onions which were extraordinary and full of flavour Enjoyable place to have a casual lunch with good tasty foodI had snapped up a 5pmcouk deal for Ricks a few months ago which had actually expired but the management at Ricks were very cooperative about it  There was a supplement for booking the deal on a Saturday so I ended up paying 135 for a bed2 cocktailsbreakfast package which I think should have cost around 185I had a pleasant experience there are nice touches in the room like an iPod dock and hair straighteners  The cocktails were great and breakfast was tasty  Fair enough as other reviewers have noted there is no view to speak of but if you walk 4 minutes to the end of Frederick Street you get a picturepostcard view of the Castle which is genuinely breathtaking  On the downside: i the bed was 2 singles pushed together and was incredibly spongy ii whoever was in the room upstairs had their marching boots on and woke me up and iii the room was incredibly hot  A good nights sleep is unlikely to occurIn summary however its a nice place with nice staff in a great location and although I may have felt a bit overcharged if I had paid top whack 135 felt OKLast minute stop with a friend this weekend and we had a fantastic time Delicious food served fresh and prompt And the cocktails were just brilliant Ana the head bartender has concocted the Honey Ryder belvedere Bond themed cocktail and its my new favourite Defo recommend any cocktail lover to give this a try Vibe was relaxed and fun with great music not too loud and we loved sitting in the drinks area for a changeI really have nothing to compare Ricks to considering we were in Edinburgh for about 48 hours for a wedding and didnt really have the opportunity to explore the nightlife around the city But thats not to say I didnt do my fair share of drinking thanks to Matty and friends behind the bar They make some excellent cocktails reasonably priced and fabulous friendly service The rooms are really comfortable and sleek but beware  its quite difficult to sleep on the weekend evenings as the bars let out around 3am and the noise carries  FAR My suggestion: take Mattys recommendation for the piano bar next door and stumble home at 3:30am Problem solved"

    "review":"I thought the beef was going to come with gravy so that was a bit disappointing Overall though the price was more than fairBarnacles and Bones is one of my goto choices for when I am out and about and need something tasty and relatively quick and tasty for dinner As the name would imply your choices are pretty simple Slow cooked beef or crab You can have it in a roll with chips or with quinoa salad I pretty much exclusively go for the salad its fresh pretty generous and I feel like I am eating something vaguely healthy Watching the food being cooked and prepared from the the police box its not the fastest place but it feels like more real and homemade and not just fastfood junkFocusing on a couple of items and doing them well is commendable but the lack of choice means everytime I come here its pretty much the same and a little variety might make my visits more regular The crab also feels a lot like a summer dish and the beef a winter one There are occasional specials from time to time but Im yet to try oneIts a box not a truck so its not going anywhere The advantage of that means you always know where to find it plus its open during the evening during the week If your are near St James and you want some street food thats better than a greasy burger give it a goI dont have anything complicated or smart to say  You hungry  You near John Lewis  Then you got a treat in store  Incredible beef or crab on chips roll or salad  Street food at its best  Popped up recently at Skylark in Porty so keep an eye out for more chances to gorge on damn fine beefAfter some extreme bargain hunting at the Omni car boot sale I needed some quick grubI had passed Barnacles  Bones a couple of times on my way home from work and going on the recent reviews I decided to give it a go I was also interested to see what food you can make in a tiny police boxA friendly hello came from within as I studied the menu The options are simple  crab dressed with lemon mayonnaise or slow cooked rib of beef Pretty gourmet for a phone box This can be served on tarragon fries quinoa salad or on a roll We decided to go for one of each on chips The food is fresh and made to order so be patient remember there is only room for one chefOur food arrives in cardboard boxes and we happily take our wooden forks and dig in Delicious The chips are wonderfully crispy and the tarragon salt is unusual but the aromatic flavour works The main attractions of the beef and the crab are lovely and soft in contrast to the crunchy potato The flavours are delicate and tasty I felt the beef was more of a success as it was hot Although the crab was delicious it was cold and didnt work as well on the chipsAt 6 a box its not the cheapest but a nice treat Its an original idea something I have not seen before always good to try something newCheers AmyIt actually took me a second to put two and two together but this is the birth place of the best damn beef roll Ive ever had Cue a story about Jody running late as always I had just lightening bolted out of a meeting across the street at The Glasshouse and had minimal time to eat before I was due at the next one Usually BMB is my goto take away in this area and I was actually headed that way when I saw the sign for slow roasted beef screech to a haltLike Rachel  Kip I opted for a roll as I thought it would be easier to manage However having snooped the crab on chips before writing this review it will hands down be my next meal here The beef was perfection So simple so good It was honestly one of the best beef rolls Ive ever consumed at breakneck speed while running down the streetI just realized today they are on Deliveroo so ill keep my fingers crossed that they delivery to Stockbridge If not with Barnacles  Bones AND BMB in in the mix this might be my favourite guilty pleasure nook of the city and obviously requires lots and lots of trips to further investigateWithout a doubt Edinburgh had become a major foodie haven in the last few years  From amazing burger joints to quaint cupcake cafes and a huge offering of Michelin starred dining this city has it all  So I shouldnt be surprised at the appearance of Barnacle and Bones but the fact its in a tiny police box really leaves me a bit flabbergasted Let me start with the basics this wee police box is right across the way from John Lewis in front of the church whos name I cant remember  Its subtle with a light purplish grey paint and yellow lettering so chances are you may just walk by it  Dont though because the food is amazing On one of the last warmish days of Autumn we opted to grab some food from here and eat in St Andrew Square  I went for the crab over quinoa salad and the boyfriend had the beef over tarragon chips  Food took a few minutes to come as everything is made fresh to order which in a tiny police box is impressive It looks like he does do a bit of prep though as the crab was ready to top my salad and the beef just needed to be heated up The chips though are made fresh to order which made them extra crispy and delicious After getting our food we wandered over to grab a seat in the square eating along the way  My crab and quinoa salad was super delicious and felt filling without leaving me feeling too full  That said I was jealous I didnt get the chips as I can confirm they were superb after stealing a few So a relatively quick lunch with good sized portions for just over 12 for two people made from a tiny police box  Seriously impressive stuff and I will definitely be back Ive also noticed they are now on Deliveroo so I may be persuaded to use that service again"

    "review":"This restaurant in housed a pretty magnificent building which is called Tudor House so go figure Its one of the two little madnesses situated in New Town and the dishes are extremely frenchI havent had any main meals here but did take a glance at the menu and saw duck risotto and some pretty pricey filet My friend and I had decided on a whim to go have dessert at some fancy restaurant and chose this one Im hoping to take my parents back there one day so they can treat me to a FULL dinner because all Ive had so far was their creme brulee which was absolutely deliciousThe restaurant itself isnt intimidating at all and was quite laid back when I was theredecember is a month of nonstop christmas dinners drinks and nights out  so arriving at La Ptite Folie for my third dinner of the festive season i had relatively moderate expectations  christmas dinners are not always the best way to try a restaurant for the first time but i neednt have worried about it this nightwe were a table of six and had preordered our food already  however we were still brought the wine menu and when asking for prosecco which they serve in Le DiVin i was told they only had sparkling wine  we all decided to go with that anyway after a brief description by the waiter and it was shortly brought over to us  before starters arrived we were also given a bread basket and a massive bowl of salad which was a nice touchstarters arrived and i was well pleased with my smoked duck blue cheese and pear salad  it was delicious and the duck was so tender and just mixed perfect with the blue cheese pear and salad  it was probably one of the best starters ive had this whole christmas season only out done by my smoked makarel salad at Field  for mains i had the salmon wrapped in phyllo dough with season veg and mash  another really tasty course with the salmon perfectly cooked and the mash and sauce just really incredibly good  after a short break and an order for coffees we were brought dessert i had tart tatin which was nice but not as good as the previous two coursesall throughout dinner we were made to feel very welcome with courses arriving in good blocks of time instead of being rushed through the meal  when booking we were told we would only have the table for two hours but as the restaurant was not too busy they happily left us to sit there for around 3 hours instead which actually allowed us to enjoy the meal instead of feeling that we were on the factory line of christmas dinners like other places i had beenif i was rating my christmas dinners by the quality of the food and service this would definitely come near the very top of my list  the only real negative point i can think of was that for 6 the table was a bit small  were fairly small girls all of us being runners and even for us the chairs were a bit close together  but its a small quibble for what was a really enjoyable evening with good food and good friendsWe had a bit of a mixed time at La Ptite Folie From my perspective both my dishes were very good but MJs dish was really pretty ordinary The location is very smart and the service good though so If you order well youll be very pleased with the placeOverall we said: in terms of the food I did very well at La Ptite Folie The soup and the seafood were both very good indeed But MJs dish was not right so once I got over my triumph I did wonder at the potential for this place to be a bit hit and miss But I have to go on what I was served and both dishes were very good So as is often the case careful ordering is richly rewarded Beyond that I have a feeling that other places operating within this milieu Lescargot Blanc to name but one are likely to serve you to a more reliably high quality level"

    "review":"Rather an odd mixture of a restaurant and whilst my fears about the booking not having registered were unfounded the request to reduce our seating from 12 to 7 hadnt been taken on board How authentically Argentinian it is I cant really say having only been to one similar place in the past and that being part of a chain in Germany As other reviewers have pointed out the staff are certainly not South American and whilst the menus state the steaks are all Argentinian meat there are pictures of Highland cows on the wall which seems rather incongruous Having said all that none of my party had any complaints about either their starters or mains the wine was decent the service attentive and the prices pretty much what youd expect for steaks Probably one to come back toA M A Z I N G jut left full and content This place is a golden nugget in Edinburgh We have been a few times as you will see from my previous reviews all 5 star Service is always good polite and very friendly stuff Check the pictures you will love it We can never finish the mains I think the fishbowl size fries is the problem but so delicious We get the platter for two but ask for it for three as most of the time it is three of us and it is no problem whatsoever Our bill comes to around 100 for the huge steak platter sides starters and drinksI usually go to the buffalo grill but I heard good things about los argentinos so thought Id give it a try Id like to say it was amazing and the steak tasted so much better than other steaks Ive had but Id be lying my opinion is that the hype isnt justified  Sadly I was not impressed and Ill be heading back to the buffalo grill with my tail between my legsIt was a long week last week I reached the end feeling fully strung out and ready to go out and drink a dozen margaritas and throw myself on the dancefloor in an attempt to destress Of course none of that happened because before even reaching the end of my meal my eyelids were almost to the floor Stress does tire one out But as I drifted off to sleep I was sent on such a lovely little journey by way of Los Argentinos  I have to let the boy steak every so often or he gets a little rambuctious so why not let him eat at one of the reputedly best places in townNow to be fair and its four not five stars because the vegetarian option sucks bottom You could argue that its a steakhouse so be grateful but at least provide an option of grilled veg its a side and not potato rice and corn Bit too much carb for me so it wasnt an option The baked potato that I did have was on the raw side too and as Jame O noted the salad wasnt particularly impressive Grilled asparagus was fab but the garlic sauce accompaniment tasted like lighter fuel On the other side I had the grilled tuna and that was something new for me The chargrilled flavour on top of some nicely cooked tuna was fantastic  and a hefty steak at that Throw a little chimichurri on the side and it was fantastic The boy tucked into some sirloin and rump steak and reported that it was as good as the reviews said they would be By the time we finished our main we were done and it was time for bed not beer as originally intended But oh what a way to goBeen meaning to review this place for ages I took a bunch of people that know what a good steak is here and none of us came away disappointed The Gigantic tbone and the 400g sirloin in particular were the highlights I think For value for money service and great food this is definately my favoutite steak restaurant I compared the prices of tbones with some other restaurants around the town I have eaten in recently and it really doesnt compare this is it for me The dishes ordered were: Tres Carnes Three types of steak on one plate looked great and massive thumbs up Bife con heso gigante The gigantic tbone this was what i ordered the first time I visited and many visitslate and my order still hasnt changed  400g Sirtloin this was impessive and gobbled up surprising quickly :D Beef kebab never really been keen on kebabs but this looked very niceEverything is served with a baked potatoe  chips and s side salad so the prices are inclusive They have a veg option too but our token veggie couldnt make it along this particular eveningOnly reason for not giving this five stars is the beer selection I dd not look at the wine menu but beer and spirits were limited I think it was Fosters as the only draft optionThere is one question you need to ask yourself before heading here do you like steakIf you answer anything other than yes and drool at the very thought then possibly Los Argentinos is not for you This is the best place to get steak in Edinburgh and it is very reasonably priced as well The interior of the restaurant is very basic and looks a bit dated however the steak makes up for thisIf I had one criticism it would be the drinks selection available in many ways it would be better to run the place as a purely bring your own bottle establishment however this isnt a pubbar if you want a drink the Cask and barrel is just up the road it is a place where you get glorious steak"

    "review":"Its not the cheapest pizzeria in the area but consistency is what I like most about Pizza Express My delicious favourite pizza tastes and looks exactly the same each time we go there Personally I have always found the welltrained staff to be attentive and professional in every way However the atmosphere is a bit sterile and its more of a lunchtime or teatime venue I wouldnt choose it for a special night outIt is Pizza Express so no real surprises The conversion of the building in Morningside is really lovely and it is pretty airy and has a slightly different feel from the Pizza Express I visited at The Shore a couple of weeks agoI did enjoy my visit but why a different rating from The Shore I think the Morningside branch is definitely successful and this is part of the problem Morningside doesnt have a huge amount in it  a few bars cafes and Indian restaurants but for kid friendly places then PE is a magnet Combine this with the offer of take away then it is bloody busy Good for a manager not so good for a customer who is hungryWe arrived after booking and got our table quickly We did arrive at 615 so if you are not a fan of little people throwing tantrums then eat later This didnt bother us We had a voucher so 2 courses for 10 Starters we had were sweet potato risotto and a tomato and mozzarella salad were well received Tasty and we were looking forward to our mains Now I like a break between my courses but we must have been around 45 mins between courses I am still not unconvinced our two gluten free pizzas were not given to another table Anyway it was a long wait and it did spoil our experience My pizza was softer than The Shore version not so much crisp which I very much enjoyed before Still good but not as great as before We were right beside the kitchen area and it was clear there needed to be more people on this section to cope with all the orders People who arrived after us were out before us and 1hr 50 mins for 2 courses is not great I was pleased I was heading home and not to the cinema Staff are really nice and friendly but my stomach isnt that forgiving Ill probably come here again as it is local for work but Ill probably eat more before just in case I have a LONG waitHad lunch at this Pizza Express with 2 others It is located in a former church and listed building but I thought the light fittings looked awful and it was feeezing inside probably hard to heat with the high ceilings so the venue did not add the experience The food itself was fine but nothing memorable We shared a pizza superfood salad and a bruschetta It is extremely pricey for what it is and I wouldnt go without using a voucher code which Pizza Express always has in abundance I dont think I will be returning to this particular restaurantGreat service lovely building and fantastic attention to detail in all aspects Definitely Edinburghs most exclusive restaurant at the moment Its also nice to have a well known place with good standards down my end of townWe were in the area for the cinema so decided to check out this branch of the chain I booked a table online as we were a wee bit pushed for time  I want sure how busy it would be We arrived early pretty amazing for me  they had no record of my booking I was  even asked me if I had the right day I showed the email confirmation  it was shrugged off The place wasnt that busy but we were left for 10 mins while someone went to sort out a table We werent off to the best of startsThe service was really slow when we were eventually seated There only seemed to be 2 wait staff on  a big group had arrived a wee while before us but 45 mins to get a pizza  a salad  I felt it was an excessive wait given the order The food itself was fine typical Pizza Express fayre I had wanted to try the Calzone which is a recent addition to the menu but I was told that the kitchen had run out of some of the ingredientsThe building itself was impressive  I especially like the quotes  pictures on the wall from The Prime of Miss Jean BrodieI like that they kept the church organ I dont like that the tables are really squished together  so much so that we felt we having dinner with the couple next to us Then there was another 15 min wait to get the bill Loses a star for the poor service on arrival  the agonising wait Oh  the fact that I had to run up the hill in heels afterwards to get to the cinema in timePizza express is Pizza Express What I do like however is that the decor and use of space is always a bit different in each one here we have quotes from the Prime of Mis Jean Brodieperfect for the location and the food whilst a chain restaurant is always tasty and satisfying There are always deals available on the internet and it is a good place to go with a crowdIts great to have somewhere else to go locally and I can see myself being a frequent visitor to this branch although I like the George IV Bridge one too My doughballs Giardiniera pizza and truffle ice cream were yummy and I managed to finish the whole lot in no time My highlight of this branch though were the young and extra enthusiastic staff who were strutting their stuff to James Brown in between courses Excellent entertainment The interior works well with the fabric of the building  a former church it doesnt feel too corporateSo yeah Pizza Express you always deliver and I am a fan You should be too"

    "review":"Very family friendly Italian restaurant The food here is lovely They do a very reasonably priced lunch menu too The atmosphere is very good and service good also for such a busy city centre location The restaurant is surprisingly big too with a whole other level tucked away downstairs Great for a staff night out Id thinkMy daughter has coeliac disease and had the best pasta meal in a restaurant she has had since being diagnosed the rest of the party also enjoyed a fabulous meal brilliant serviceOne star not because of the food but just plain business sense Dont tell us you close at 11PM only to arrive and be closed at 10PM Im sure the food is amazing and the ambience was great but this is very disappointingThis was some of the best Italian food I have experienced Tried both the Lasagna di Mamma and the Vittoria Pasta The Vittoria Pasta was out of control good The ambiance is hip with a modern feel but the service and food feels homestyle and comforting They have a great list of wines for amazing prices and a large selection of gelato flavors for dessertWhile in town we stayed on the Royal Mile walked to the restaurant for dinner and then hopped a good number of nearby pubs to end the night I would absolutely go here again even two nights in a rowThis smartlooking yet not too pricey restaurant near to the centre of Edinburgh certainly knows what it is doing when it comes to both food and appearances An expansive menu with many options suiting vegetarians and many glutenfree options contains a variety of familiar Italian dishes and some more personal ones The serving staff were quick friendly and extremely polite Personally I opted for the halfpizzahalfpasta something Ive only seen here I chose the Capricciosa Pizza and the Spaghetti Carbonara originale Both were very well cooked and seasoned The spaghetti carbonara was a little creamier than most traditional carbonara dishes that I am used to  a person with me who ordered the inhouse carbonara complained it was far too creamy it looked it  but all the more was full of taste The pizza was thin crispy and had a delicious balance between pizza sauce and cheese which was pleasing All very authentic and true to Italian food The drinks throughout the night were delicious as was the selection of wines though the waiter should brush up on his knowledge of the wines served  I dont know to a question of the recommended white wine was disappointingThe one gripe I had with the restaurant and one reason I am withholding giving it a five star review was after being seated and waiting for 15 minutes our party had to remind the host to assign us a server to which he hastily beckoned a waitress to serve us All in all a good place to eat in a group as a family or even on a dateSuggested by the hotel Missoni to go here Great food and great service The BEST lasagna I have had in years If you are here you must try this place You will not be disappointed"

    "review":"I went for lunch yesterday table of 3 I decided to have the special plaice it was sublime Highly recommend if its on the board again Eggs were awesome  the coffee was great as wellIve rerated Salt Cafe after two consecutive poor experiences Both times completely down to customer service The first time we were sat and proceeded to be served by a completely disinterested stonyfaced waitress She gave us our menus failing to tell us what the daily specials were With nearly half the mains consisting of daily changing specials and not being advertised anywhere else it didnt make reading the menu easy With no communication or show of any discernible emotion from our server we left pretty underwhelmedThe second time was on a busy Saturday lunch time We went in and asked if there was a table for three available we were told that there wasnt any available immediately but a table were just about to pay their bill I said that was fine and wed be back in a moment We went to the shop next door for what was no more than 5 minutes Returning to the restaurant we were met by the same member of staff I had just spoken to and was told there were no tables available Looking over at the table we had just been told was about to become free I was annoyed to see two completely different customers seated there They must have literally been the next through the door after I had said we will be back in a moment for that table Poor form and certainly not leaving any inclination to returnId passed by a few times and decided to make an outing of Salt with a friend For starters the staff are charming and adorable And when doesnt that sell a place I smiled and was chatty perhaps that influenced them to be nice to me not saying those other reviewers who said poor service deserved it but I began with a cappuccino and it was hairy and pungent just the right thing for the wakemeup I expect when I order coffee Bit of a coffee lameo Get juice I ordered a burger and my friend requested soup I love burgers I make a mean one from scratch so Im not very nice when a chef botches the job Its not that hard The secret is spitok not seriously but Im not giving away the secret Point is a chef should know And this chef has the goods My burger was slightly done on the outside bit of pink on the inside with tons of juice and flavor Perfect This burger is a reason I will stop making my own They also had a great playlist going which they said was a spotify one they created It was like a normal cool coffeehouse array but a bit more upbeatOn our first visit to Salt Cafe they were unfortunately fully booked with a few walk ins waiting at the bar before us as well This tells you how great the place is before youve even visited so we were adamant on coming back as soon as we were back in Edinburgh Ringing a few days before we booked a midday spot for brunch on a Friday And you know what its a good job we did as it was still super busy when we arrived The menu consists of breakfast served till mid afternoon so well call it brunch and other lunch items with a range of specials available As part of the specials there are regularly changing smoothie flavours I had a blueberry oaty gingery thingy and it was delicious For food my boyfriend had a full Scottish with extra haggis and I had eggs benedict with a sausage on the side The food was absolutely amazing and a special shout out goes to that sausage Yummy with a capital y Really good standard of food good service and a cosy atmosphere inside Its the kind of place you could take the parents to whilst also being suitable for a hungover breakfast with your mates Just make sure you book in advance but itll be worth it I promiseGreat place hadnt booked anywhere for Mothers Day as they dont take bookings at the weekend we though lets try anyway glad we did table at the window and staff said we could move to one through the back when it was available How nice Excellent bloody marys just the right amount if spice  food good too eggs benedict and royale were perfect and more than enough   Definatly be backSalt Cafe seemed to take its sweet time opening up but it was worth the waitInside the space is made good use of with a large central bar accessible from all sides an open and airy front dining area with further seating at the back of the restaurant with more private tables Id say the decor has a very nautical New EnglandScandinavian feel to it Its a very comfortable and relaxing spaceThe menu is inventive offering a diverse range of well paired wholesome fresh and seasonal produce There are numerous healthy options as well as a few guilty pleasures thrown in to enjoy for good measure There is the choice of small dishes ideal for sharing starters mains and sides catering for any occasion or appetite I had the oysters to start they were clean juicy and refreshing pretty much all that you can look for in an Oyster I had a mackerel main that was lovely well flavoured and rich It was a bit on the oily side but that didnt detract from a very nice dishThey have an extensive choice at the bar with some very nice wines Scottish beers and an array of spirits Id imagine their cocktails are good and will have to sample them sometimeOverall its good place to suit any occasion whether you are after lunch dinner or just drinks and a nibble and all at a very reasonable price Ill definitely be back"

    "review":"We had the set menu at Wedgwood in 2014 The food was average and quite bland which is why we did not return However Ive heard good reviews from my friends about it since then I would give it another go and try the A la Carte menu Not on the top of my list of restaurants in Edinburgh at the momentIts a shame that Wedgewood is near the bottom of the Cannongate  an area that is generally quieter than everywhere else in Edinburgh because it really is an excellent restaurant The staff and the food are excellent And the price is even betterThey do a great lunch menu daily all details are put up on the window in the morning and each option is mouth watering Ive lost count of all the times Ive stood outside this restaurant and oogled the menu droolingThey are a bit inventive with their food  I once had parsnip creme brulee  but have an open mind and you can only be surprised I recently ate in total darkness in a conceptrestaurant in Paris it was a weird experience but I would highly recommend it and so I found I have started to appreciate the taste of everything now and Wedgewood is a total dream Its bliss Everybody Ive spoken to about this stunning restaurant love it as much as I do  really is a great placeOur party of 3 had an excellent dinner there Starters mains and cheese could not be faulted  there was no room for dessert not that portions are too big  we just werent that hungryThe excellent wine selection and attentive service are also worth notingOnly downside would be the premises: well appointed but not airy enough downstairs is windowless upstairs has nice kitchen smells When good food like this is served I dont consider this to be too relevantA more upmarket restaurant in a quite area I hadnt even realised this was here until I was taken here my a friend I loved the service and the quality of the food I had the Scottish lamb wrapped in cous cous and it was delicious and my friends really liked their dishes too I really appreciate it when places that are going to charge you a little bit more will at least have a higher standard in service and quality in food without it being too pompous or the waiters hanging around your table Wedgewood seems somewhat unspoilt by its touristy location and the menu was inventive and according to the waitress renewed quite often A breath of fresh air for this part of town for a more special evening dining experienceWe were planning a ladies lunch it was second day of the festival and the sun was shining  So where do ladies that lunch goWe decided on Wedgewood so we took advantage of the 12 pounds for two courses or 3 courses for 16 pounds The restaurant itself is well laid out and had a lovely buzz about it when we walked in Wed booked in advance which was a good idea as the restaurant as full soon after we arrivedWe went for a fresh salmon starter which was served with beetroot puree and a deep fried haggis with a wonderfully spicy salsa The salmon was so fresh I was instantly transported to the beach at North Berwick and the beetroot puree has a wonderfully earthy taste which wasnt too sweet as beetroot dishes can be sometimes The haggis was beautifully soft inside with a nice crunchy bite on the outside and the salsa had a really good kick on the finishOur mains were just as good and my coley filet was cooked perfectly with the flesh still being firm and flavourful I have to admit I dont remember which wine we ordered but it was delicious as I left my friend to order that as I had to duck out and deal with a parking situation at that point of the mealIf youre looking for a great value lunch served with a changing menu taking advantage of the fresh seasonal ingredients available Id highly recommend WedgewoodBy all means take advantage of the 3 courses for 16 pounds but if like us youre too full then Id highly recommend a wander to let your lunch digest then a trip across the road to Mimis picnic parlour that does Lucas ice creamsI was lucky enough to be treated to a fab dinner here at the end of Dec 12 The food was great and the staff were lovely There was a slight glitch when the waitress admitted forgetting to put our dessert order through after we chased it up but then they knocked it off the bill which was very decentWould definitely recommend it for a treatspecial occasion"

    "review":"The Deli is welcoming and friendly cafe situated on Morningside Road  Its name is slightly misleading as it is not necessarily a delicatessen  It probably does most its trade through selling filled rolls sandwiches and hot drinks  The interior decor is clean and the bright colours on the wall create a bright atmosphere  At the front counter the service is efficient and they have an impressive range of ingredients for sandwich fillings as well as a variety of different breads and baguettes  I had cajun chicken and salad in a nice crispy baguette with a packet of cheese and onion crisps  It tasted great but it was also quite pricey as it came to about 350 for what was essentially just a sandwich and a bag of crisps  I cant dispute the quality of this place however and The Deli offers fresh ingredients an extensive range of food and drink and great service to matchBeen going here for years  The two Turkish guys that run it are brilliant  I probably only manage in about once a fortnight but I only have to walk in the door and theyre already putting the mocha on heat for me  I think they know all their regulars by name and preference and there are plenty of them too  You dont need to be a well known face to be made welcome though  Lunchtime soup is to be savoured its almost always tomato and basil by the way  Be sure to ask for bread to accompany"

    "review":"Nice soup here their Thai Green Chicken is hot n spicy and just the right side of nippy on the tongue Good selection of sandwich rolls and fillings too made to order They have a selection of ready made ones too which often feature combinations which are a little bit different Handy for Greyfriars Kirk which on a good day is a nice place to relax and have your lunch outdoorsI hadnt been here before a rushed lunch lead me past all my usual haunts and landed me smack bang at the back of the queueIts pretty damn good but  I have to say that It seems as though it has a pretty average selection of sandwich fillings Theres nothing that really jumps out at you from the menu board  but its not like theres nothing that wont get your mouth watering The fillings are usually pretty huge and theres a nice selection of breads tooI think this place does breakfast and soups too as well as cakes etc Overall its pretty cheap which is always nice too :This is a cool wee sandwich bar indeed both conviently located and selling tasty AM timed and lunch time waresI think because sandwich bars are less of a one off place that youll visit and more of a regular everyday thing particularly if you work in the area its important to find a decent place and if it ticks the boxes stick with it Bobbys ticks several Its easy to get to being right on the main road and near Chambers St Forrest Road and George IV Bridge Its also reasonably priced and has a good variety of food stuffs to pick from with bagels toasted sandwiches normal not toasted sandwiches and soup all tastily filled and flavoured The staff are super nice too which always makes me more enthusiastic about handing my money over several times a weekBobbys Sandwich Bar is a vibrant zesty wee cafe nestled near to our wee friend Greyfriars BobbyAs the ladies have outlined its open till mid afternoon so its not one to amble into at the back of 4 for a pre dinner snack But if you can shake off the covers early or are forced to due to work commitments they make a mean breakfastAside from selling a decent selection of teas coffee paninis and cake their soup of the day is cheap and very tasty As Lynsey said you can go all out and treat yourself to some greasy spoon the healthy soup cancels out the fatty fry honest and still find you spend little over a fiverFor the bright eyed and bushy tailed Bobbys does the job Its a thriving wee business that is no doubt the first stop for many office workers and students in the areaThe best tuna with sweetcorn baguette in Edinburgh  Fact  The tuna sweetcorn baguette was my lifeline when I was in uni  I used to buy cheesy Doritos from across the way and put them in the baguette  No joke I am actually salavating a little as I type this  I dont know what it was but the sweetcorn was wonderfully fresh and sweet tuna not too fishy just right on the mayo and the baguette was wonderfully crispy on the outside and gorgeously soft on the inside  I am seriously starving now  When I go back I will be getting a bacon sarnie as per Mary Ls recommendation  My only complaint is that its only open until 2 or 3pm at least it used to be so I cant go there right nowThis is a great sandwich place right on Forrest Rd near the University of Edinburgh library and the National Library of Scotland The staff is super friendly and the food is great My favorite is the pate and cranberry sauce and the brewed coffee there is the best in the city in my opinion Youll pay a little more than you would at one of those baguette chains but the quality is way better at Bobbys The bread they use is fantastic too"

    "review":"Maxis on Raeburn Place in the heart of Stockbridge has been there for ever and yet it still seems to retain a sense of the temporary I dont know whether its the fixtures and fittings or whether its just that the walls are decorated with clocks but it does make for a slightly unsettling experience I must be the only one bothered by this because at any time of the day this place is buzzing making getting a table a logistical challenge in the tablefilled space The menu has changed in recent months largely for the better They still serve an all day breakfast including such Scottish stalwarts  as french toast and pancakes bacon and maple syrup But for me the greatest improvement is the soupoftheday Always fresh always homemade and always delicious The coffee is good the cakes look good but Ive never tried one honest and the turnover is fast enough to keep the salad and deli offerings looking appetising The service waivers between the good and the flakey but is rarely poor I put the popularity down to a couple of things: That the food is reliably good and reasonably priced and that Maxis isnt Starbucks or Costa or Cafe Nero It is a local cafe but not just for local people It could be better but then it wouldnt be MaxisPleasant staff good French toast and well made scrambled egg as well as a reasonable selection of deli items made my recent brunch visit here a pleasure Its often busy but the impression I got was that once youre in and not taking the mickey by occupying a table and stringing out one pot of tea you could stay for an age and chill out watching the great and the good wander past through Stockbridge read the paper etc  a rare thing in Edinburgh to my knowledge given that Starbucks etc never impress me as being more than extensions of your lounge with profit at the forefront of their ethos Stopped in here for a late lunch yesterday and safe to say that nothings gone wrong with the place in terms of food or service since I was last in Their menu could though do with a thorough proofreading as having such errors as deserts instead of desserts isnt really excusableAlice summed this place up  Maxis is the regular meeting place of ladies who lunch and excessively talk about their friends But if youre looking for a place to talk to your buddies in a similar fashion its rather niceServing up wholesome food and a few continental deliesque offerings Maxis has one foot in being like an old fashioned tea room and the other on moving with the times I didnt find it difficult to get a table since its quite big but then I wasnt visiting near lunch time Its probably mobbed then especially on a Saturday because even during a mid week afternoon it seemed pretty popular with the localsThats always an indication of a good cafe though and service was very efficient They do a tasty soup of the day for a very reasonable price which I polished offI can imagine this place doing well if it was transported to the main street in a seaside town I dont know why but it reminded me of the kind of cafes they have scores of in Helensburgh But by that I mean its relaxed airy affordable and a good place to come for a natter over a cup of brewIve been coming to Maxis for aaaaages since my school days actually Maxis has been a solid part of the Stockbridge cafe scene for a good while now and does its cafe performing job pretty well so has seemed to last the distance Not outrightly trendy but still what you would call a really nice cafe to look at Maxis doesnt have too many frills to it but is still pleasant and comfortable enough that you feel happy for a bit sitting with a coffee and partaking in some chit chatThe food is really reliably good here The cafe serves a range of paninis salads and other wee menu bits plus amazing cakes and last time I was in I went for the veggie quiche plus salad of the day which was delish The food and coffees are the definite highlight of coming here which of course they should be seeing as thats the whole point but I dont feel entirely relaxed here for some reason Although Maxis is fairly laidback I felt the atmosphere was a bit on the quiet side when I went inmaybe sticking on a few cheeky background beats would have sorted that Also the staff said almost nothing to us the entire time my friends and I were in there which I found slightly unusual It didnt exactly bother me because I dont generally go to cafes expecting some sort of life changing conversation with the staff although if that happens then fair play and I was bantering away to my friends anyway it was just something we noted afterwards Perhaps there was some cafe themed urgent work going on which meant the staff had no time for isnt the weather great are you having a nice day type chat Regardless Ill be coming back again for some lunch time feasting and no doubt a large slab of calorie laden cakeIts really hard to give this place a review My one star is not based on the food the food is good and the atmosphere is goodWhats not so good is the fact that 4 Sundays in a row now I have wanted to take my daughter out for some quality time over breakfast and every time this place is NEVER open on timeIs it too much to ask for a place to open at 10 on a Sunday We always wait around a bit but by 1010 we go somewhere else Its a shameMaxis is a solid place for brunch The lunch menu is fine but nothing special and in a city like Edinburgh there are plenty of places that are something special The dinner menu is uninspiringI normally go for the pancakes with maple syrup and bacon and it never disappoints I guess its difficult to mess this particular dish up but thankfully they dont They do a decent hot chocolate too but admittedly it is just machine hot chocolate with whipped cream and marshmallowsMaxis is a little bit pricey expect to pay 1015 more than you think you should for what you get It might be the nicest place for brunch in Stockbridge but a five minute bus trip into the city centre will take you to superior places Its certainly not a must visit but not a must avoid either"

    "review":"Very friendly and especially affordable place great for students Everything seems deep fried cant complain Were visiting today againI wish I could give a higher star but I cant  Ok folks here it goes this is a bold claim but I stand by it 100 AhemThis is the best Fish and chips shop in the city and the best I have ever had I dont even know where to start Shop is ran by a very nice Italian Gentleman who is always in a good mood recognizes me every time I go in  and always makes my food right on the spot The fish is amazingly fresh and almost no bones in it The batter has flavor not like some crappy Wetherspoons fish and chips but actual flavor It comes out piping hot with the fresh chips It get wrapped up in the paper and given to you  Oh its sooooo good and you know its going to be greasy goodness when the paper gets soaked through a little bit That people  is how real fish and chips is wrapped in newspaper  hot greasy  and flavorful Theres an assortment of other food you can get to  I am to try a calzone next that I am sure is just as good Rafael  the italian gentleman and owner  will sometimes give you free chips while you wait And trust me you have to wait sometimes because this place will get busy with all its regulars But its worth it With all that said I dare someone nay I Challenge someone  to find a better fish and chip shop then this one because I dont think thats going to happen Keep up the good work Rafael because as long as I have air in these lungs I will be a regular at your shopBeing a lifelong chippy fan and having read some of the complimentary things on here about The Golden Bite I made it my duty to embark on a pilgrimage After all a good chippy is surprisingly hard to come byAs we entered my girlfriend and I were greeted by the chip guru with the sort of warm welcome that usually only a loving dog can offer This already felt like a homecoming As we became acquainted over the fryer he passed me three of his most perfect chips to sample while our fish bubbled away Our anticipation grew as he assured us that this fish was going to be really nice and worth the wait Taking in the surroundings top marks for cleanliness And a fridge stocked with my favourite San Pellegrino lemonade is a big plusWhen we got our hands on the goods we eagerly headed down to the promenade where we plonked ourselves on a picnic bench to find out if it was indeed worth the wait Well let me tell you Ive had a few chippies in my time some might even consider me a chippy snob but this is up there with the best that Ive had The chips are perfect  nicely rectangular and full of flavour And the fish is beautiful oily and fresh in a tasty batter And it would seem that even the local wasps have caught word of this as they did their damnedest to impose themselves on our feast When we were finally forced to panic evacuate I spilt the remains of my meal and the onlooking seagull scavengers divebombed them before strutting around the table heckling They couldnt spoil our day though Its ofishal Id just sampled the best chippy in Edinburgh and Ive since made it my calling to spread the word Chippy goldThis is the worst thing that has ever happened to me The Golden Bite has ruined fish and chips for me forever Because I will never  EVER  find a fish supper superior or perhaps even equal to the one I had this weekend from the Golden BiteI travelled to Portobello with Moray L on the express mission of trying the legendary Bite Of Gold after reading Justin Gs review and we were the first ones in when the doors opened at 16:45 The man who greeted us over the counter could not have been happier if he had been a dog in a field full of squirrels It doesnt seem an exaggeration to say that I suspect frying fish has been his lifelong passionBecause we were so early we got the first haddock to go into the fryer  clean white haddock of gobsmacking Jonahswallowing proportions which the chap wobbled at us playfully before setting about the battering and fryingAt this point  minutes after the doors opened  the shop filled I mean it properly filled I know not how many of these were pilgrims like us and how many were locals but its clear that the reputation of The Golden Bites fish suppers is widely renowned I was reaching five stars simply from the cleanliness the rich frying smell and the chaps jollity before Id even put anything in my mouth and when a small girl entered and he pulled down a teddy bear to wave at her I was smitten with the place entirely But the food The food The proof of the poisson is in the eatingOh My Wrapped lovingly in paper and carried down reverently to the seafront for consumption these piscine Midas fillets were battered to crispy perfection but still with the softer underside that makes a fish supper truly sensational The chips  proper chip shop chips  were glorious and plentiful but not so numerous as to prevent one from finishing the lustrous luscious fishywishy that so enchanted both me and Moray I need to go back No you dont understand I NEED to go back Now And I dont think I will ever love a fish supper in quite the same way that I love the Golden Bites"

    "review":"Lost count of the times Ive been here over the last few years with parties large or small In my opinion the best of the Edinburgh Howies My visit this week was no exception to the standard of service and quality of the menu that Ive come to expect The haggis starter was tasty and the main course of parsnip pepper  something tart was delicious and filling Finished off with the renowned banoffi pie and efficiently served throughout this was yet another enjoyable meal in a deservedly popular Edinburgh institutionOutstanding place Very celiac friendly They had great service and fantastic food Highly recommendThis place sells poor food at high prices Dont eat here My mom and I were in the Grassmarket area of Edinburgh near the Royal Mile below the Castle We were hungry and looking for a pleasant meal and evening Howies looks like an upscale comfortable restaurant with 20 entrees and a selection of appetizers so we decided to have dinner there Unfortunately the food is mediocre the portions small and the service both inattentive and grudging I had one of the daily specials which was a Caesar salad with chicken and bacon When it arrived I was somewhat dismayed by the presentation: a plate with some lettuce on it Turns out the chunks of chicken and tiny pieces of undercooked bacon were hidden underneath all the lettuce It predictably didnt taste that great My mom ordered the Baked Fillet of Loch Duart Salmon with Herb Crust for 15 It turned out to be a very small piece of salmon with no crust It was served with some pea sauce which itself was quite bland and added nothing to the salmon It was rather puzzling to see a dish that was so spectacularly unsatisfyingIn addition to the poor food the service was bad After dinner my mom and I both ordered tea Hers arrived with a tea bag in the pot but I just got a pot of hot water and someone from the kitchen with a tea bag trying to run and catch up with the server before he delivered the hot water It would have been rather funny if it wasnt unprofessional Similarly I noticed one of the cooks eating a sandwich in the kitchen which I understand is generally considered poor form or possibly a health hazardI think the meal might not have been so disappointing if we had not been looking forward to a really good dinner the type that you normally get at a well decorated expensive restaurant I strongly recommend that you eat somewhere elseOne of my favorite meals out in a long time We enjoyed this enough we went back two nights running  and enjoyed both The location is right by the castle so easy to find for new people to the city and both nights we arrived as they opened for dinner at 5:30The restaurant is nice and atmospheric  one night I could watch the pass from the kitchen which was neat and the beer suggested by the waiter was the best Id had in Edinburgh Stewart Ales Holyrood for those interested I had the soup the stuffed chicken and a side of chips each night and it was lovelyThe icing on the cake is they catered very nicely for my wife who has celiac disease and we struggled to find placed to eat out hence we went backAmazing food amazing service Random find absolutely pleased I would recommend this place any dayGreetings from NYC Loved it here Walked in for a late lunch after visiting St James Court Factory Outlet I had bread w olive oil 175 Chiles sav Blanc great bargain for NYers calamari and salmon Salmon was moist and good The breadcrumbs on top of it were good too The calamari was crunchy and good too 2 courses for L995 Great meal Ill return the next time I am in EDI"

    "review":"Ive walked past here more than once every week ever since it was converted and opened in its current format Each time Ive caught a glimpse of the apparent confused look inside and opted to skip thinking it to be a place that just wouldnt be for me I was wrong A night out with a friend exploring a few new places found us outside the Brig chatting to a bar member on her break She managed to talk us inside and Im glad she did The original confused interial comment stands but once seeing it in context it makes a little more senseWooded table booths sit side by side with easy chairs mixed furniture styles adorn each corner This is in the main a cocktail it turns out with lighting and music to match but unlike your west end crowded noisy unfriendly overpriced offerings this place feels more like the result of a splicing of an antiques shop your local watering hole and a 2nd hand record shops sound system with a drop of confusion and bemusement thrown in for good measureIf not gathered I really quite liked this place Only thing Id like to see would be the staff being a little more sure of their drinks listing she might have been new but was quite confused when asking for a rum and coke specifying a particular rum from their list and the beer taps not being used to serve wine on tapWe were staying in Leith and fancied trying out somewhere close by However we were staying in the heart of seafood lovers triangle  which my other half is not a fan of  so we opted for Bar Brig Lovely little bar which lots of reclaimed wood cleverly used to create benches and booths The bar had a lovely atmosphere and the bar man was quick to serve us always a plus : With such an extensive burger menu we opted for a burger  with fries and slaw to share The slaw was lovely and def enough to share My veggie Morrocan burger was very tasty with lots of flavour could have been a wee bit warmer mind you My husband opted for the blackened cajun chicken burger and was pleased it was a breast So you may be wondering why not 4 5 stars After a short while the seating became uncomfortable and I was not impressed with eating my burger out of an old orange box I dont get this whole hipster style anything but a plate craze at the mo it cluttered up the table and felt too much like take away being served our meal in a boxIve been wandering past this bar loads on my way to and from work Its one of Leith Walks new bars Someone has taken a classic possibly read dodgy as fuck spit and sawdust for the blood bars and turned it into a trendy new thing Initially what drew me to Bar Brig is its big Heverlee sign Its a delicious beer and I dont find a lot of bars serving it in Edinburgh and its not very far from my house which helps of a week day nightI feel its a confused little bar Theyve a very well stocked bar loads of interesting beers and gins and such very much ticking the things that are in right now boxes but the guy serving us on a friday night didnt really have much of a clue about anything They bar clearly has a found objects thing going on all the furniture is made of driftwood or something similar which normally I find pretty annoying because its uncomfy but theyve adorned the place with throws and cushions which actually makes it really cosy A big plus for me but the bar is really weirdly lit Huge BRIG sign that floods the bar with LED light and generally I feel they would be suited both turning the brightness down on that sign and just generally going for warmer lights in the barI havent tried the food yet so there might be more to come from Bar Brig but its not massively charmed meA lovely little bar For Edinburgh it boats fairly cheap drinks and cocktails and even keeps prosecco on tap The interior is country and makes the place really homey The staff are great and the food delicious Originally I came here with a groupon which was a great deal platters and cocktails for 4 for 22 But they have their own deals like 5 meals and drink discountsThis place is a go"

    "review":"We had a fabulous dinner at Rodi The owner Tom Cruise was a great host and and made us feel very welcome Best meal we have had in a long time either in Europe or in the United StatesOutstanding restaurant Really delicious Turkish food Very friendly owner waiter who calls himself Tom Cruise Would highly recommendAmazing food We had lamb and chicken Everything was absolutely delicious The service was  very good too  very friendly and quick If I lived in Edinburgh I would definitely be a regular herethe monthly yelp dinner to try out new and exciting restaurants is always good fun especially this months visit to Rodi  this restaurant is a far venture from my usual side of town so probably some place i would have never visited had it not been for Blythe Rs suggestion  after a rather lengthy bus ride to the side of town followed by a very chilly walk past the EICC i spotted a glowing beacon of turkish food that was filled with fellow yelpers warm bright colours and the delicious smelling of grilled meatsthere were a good number of us and as in my usual style i was last to arrive  however i didnt need long to contemplate the menu and was quite happy to order when the waitress returned with my turkish tea  i went for a starter of hummous followed by a grilled chicken dish  im not sure how discrimatory i can be toward hummous as i love it and have yet to find any that hasnt been to my taste  i was given a suitable portion size served along a basket of warm flat bread for dipping  my rumbling tummy was suitably pleased and i started looking forward to the main coursedishes took a bit to arrive as it appears everything is cooked fresh after you order  there is a massive charcoal fire behind the register which is both warm and cosy for a cold night but also the palce where they grill all their meat  which dishes did start to arrive we were given a number of side salads and dips and finally plentiful dishes of grilled meats with rice  my grilled chicken sat atop a smoked aubergine dip and was accompanied by a side of rice and grilled flat bread  the portion was HUGE  seriously HUGE  even after a hard run i was barely able to eat half before i was totally defeated  but portion size aside the chicken and aubergine and rice was super super tasty and i was sad to think i couldnt eat every bite  the chicken was tender and juicy the aubergine dip had a really lovely creamy smokey taste that mixed so well with both the chicken and the rice  the salad dishes on the side were a nice veggie accompainment but i struggled to have more than a few forkfuls of theseso overall i really really enjoyed Rodi  the food was excellent and in the future id likely get a main dish to share with someone  the staff are super friendly and the only negative point i can see is its rather far distance from where i live or tend to go out  however i would this a great place to get some dinner before the many festival shows at the EICCI went their based on yelp recommendations which was very helpful the food was good the service was really bad and slow you see the owner jump and move around the tables and you wounded why And I asked for the bell and ten minutes later he came and asked me for the table for new comers but where is my bellI work just along the road and was waiting for this restaurant to open for the past few months Front was done back in August so I knew it will be a Turkish place I am a kebab enthusiast so you can imagine my anticipation Originally I had booked a different restaurant for Monday evening past As soon as I found out that it had opened I cancelled my plans and went for dinner to Rodi Wow Both me and my wife were very impressed  We went for their recommendation and ordered mix meat plate Every bit of meat on my plate was full of flavour tender and cooked just perfect Great value for money I know this place is not Martin Wishart but for what they are doing level of the restaurant and concept they are ticking all the boxes Thats why 5 star plus they need a boost Cant wait to go back actually I am going back tonight with my son"

    "review":"With so many top quality restaurants in the city centre offering really great lunch deals like Tigerlily or Fishers In The City I have to say Hadrians doesnt really fare that well in comparison Theirs in more expensive than most and yet not actually any different in terms of the sorts of food on offer when you look at the menu Haggis Neeps  Tatties for example isnt exactly hard to come by in the scottish capital and so if youre going to do it you need to do it so much better than anyone else Unfortunately when I had it for my starter it wasnt Dont get me wrong it wasnt unenjoyable or bad it was just a bit repetitive and boring and not particularly exciting And my main course continued along much the same theme  if I want pasta with a tomato and red pepper sauce I can make it quite easily for myself at home in about 10 minutes and for a fraction of the priceI gave it 3 stars because the service as youd expect in a swanky hotel was excellent And theres no denying that its location is fantastic and convenient I just expected something a little more exciting for what we paid and couldnt help feeling a little disappointed when we leftHadrians was one of the many closed restaurants the night my parents and I arrived starving and unaware of Edinburghs earlier closing hours compared to other capitals anyway we walked around the city centre and returned to our hotel desolate and defeated where we had to settle for sandwichesI was extremely excited when my parents decided to take me there the next time they visited me and having walked by enough times to know how fancy it was we made an evening of it Hadrians is one of the restaurants of the Balmoral Hotel The menu was surprisingly more wholesome than I would expect from really fancy restaurants which usually leaves me more amused with the imagination and presentation than well fed I had a risotto and wild mushroom dish but ofcourse there were meal tastes and exchanges and I have to say my mothers seared halibut with pesto was absolutely delicious Ofcourse there wasnt much of it but it tasted goodddd I personally prefer these more expensive restaurants for ambiance rather than good food which one can always have at home so if youre heading there purely for the culinary experience be prepared to dish out and dress upExpensive and totally worth it As usual only one vegetarian option We were staying at the hotel so we had both breakfasts and dinners there and were happy with the food and the staff was very friendly and proffesional Except we did ask for white wine and got red insteadObviously Hadrians Brasserie isnt cheap and its in the shadow of the Michelinstarred Number One upstairs but it was by far one of the best Dinners Ive had in EdinburghIve forgotten the exact steak that I ordered that long ago but it was delicious and the garlic snails I enjoyed beforehand despite my initial trepidation were beautifully prepared and delicious probably more due to the garlic than the insects I was putting into my mouthIts a classy place with excellent staff and I thoroughly recommend it if works paying for all this and a bottle of good MalbecCelebrated American Thanksgiving here Haggis was rated one of the top in Edinburgh Coupled with sea bass dinner was very enjoyable Service was impeccable one of the best weve had in any restaurant for that matter Be sure to try the Baked Alaska dessert  dont let me ruin the surprise for you but its not fishI think I judged this place a bit too harshly the first time around When I was taken here for lunch yesterday I had a really gorgeous mealYes the surroundings were lovely and the service was great and all the rest of it but I cant stop raving about how nice my meal was My starter of a salmon tirille was really tasty with fresh coriander and thinly sliced beetroot and rocket and it came with wafer thin sourdough bread There was also plenty of it which makes a welcome change compared to a lot of swanky restaurantsMy main course was even nicer Although it did specify on the menu that my sea bream came served with Israeli coucous Id just assumed theyd stuck the Israeli in to try and sound fancier and more exotic than it really was But it would seem that Im a bit of a pleb when it comes to world foods as this stuff was completely different to anything Ive had before The whole thing was drizzled in a gorgeous red pepper and cream sauce which added the finishing touchI still think that some of the dishes on offer were a bit plain and I still think that 16 for 2 courses at lunchtime is a bit steep compared to other similar restaurants But I wasnt paying"

    "review":"The food at Noor is pretty great  and as already explained by Emily T the portions are perfect for if you want a guilt free pig out of delicious indian food in a one person banquetAnyway the food here is great  if a little over priced in my opinion especially in comparison to other indian take aways in the area Dont write it off yet though  while other places are cheaper they lack the authenticity and generaly very hight quality food that Noor offers Choose wiselyNoor is totally deserving of my first 5 star review and youll now see whyWhenever I want an Indian takeaway there is only one word on my lips  Noor  For the past few years it has stood out for me as a purveyor of some of Edinburghs finest takeaway food  I totally agree with what Jonathan said: there are cheaper places but they dont quite measure upAll of the food I have ordered from Noor has been top notch  I tend to go for the less spicy end of the spectrum so stick with kormas and bhunas occasionally stepping up to a tikka masala or rogan josh  All of the food has been tasty and flavoursome something which can be lacking in some takeawaysThe menu has a good variety and the online ordering service means that you dont even have to leave the comfort of your sofa  Delivery has always been on time and the food has been piping hotIts so difficult to communicate the warm feeling that Noor gives in my stomach before eating  Even the mention of a Noor curry starts the saliva production  I command everyone to enjoy the awesomeness that is NoorNoor is definitely up there as one of my favourite takeaways They serve really traditional and authentic Indian dishes which are of excellent qualityNoors menu has a vast selection of fine Indian food which are very well priced at around six pounds for a main meal and you can see the chefs preparing your meal in the back I love their Chicken Tikka Buhna which is full of flavour and spices  They also have met menus available which include starters a main and rice for just under seven pounds per person They also have a wide variety of vegetarian meals which are priced at under five pounds for a main course Noor offer a home delivery service which I have always found to be extremely efficient and you can order either online by phone text or by popping into the shop itself The food is cooked fresh on the premises and it only takes about 10 minutes after ordering for your food to be ready They are open until midnight seven days a week so it is great place to stop buy for decent meal on your way back from a night outNoor is an excellent Indian takeaway which offers quick friendly service and excellent food  Ive eaten from here twice with my flatmates and on both occassions we were far from disappointed  The menu is extensive with a huge range of authentic Indian dishes taken from all over the country  I had the lamb Rogan Josh the first time and it was amazing with a delicious blend of flavours and a good amount of heat running through it  The portion size wasnt huge but certainly hit the spotWe delivered the second time and I went for the Tandoori chicken kebabs which were seriously spicy yet also tender  The delivery time was almost negligible it was so fast and the whole meal between four of us came to under 40  Id definitely recommend Noor if youre in the areaYou simply cannot beat Noor Indian Takeaway  The food is delicious enough to make you rejoice for being human and having the ability to appreciate such things Noor is located just a few doors down the road from my flat and as such I have quickly become a regular My friends and I always get the set meals which include a choice of golden oldies curries all the classics such as Korma Rogan Josh Dopiaza Madras Bhuna and my personal favourite Dhansak along with rice or naan five vegetable pakoras along with some salad and sauces  What more could you want All for six to seven pounds per person depending on how many of you there are The absolute beauty of Noor is that the food tastes great AND the portions are very generous  One portion of curry usually lasts me for my tea that night as well as a very satisfying lunch the next day As it provides at least two meals it certainly offers great value for money  The pakoras are wonderfully crispy also and for an extra 2 you can order a bag of ten that are worth every pennyDue to my close vicinity I have always collected my orders in person and I have never been kept waiting for than 15 minutes If you prefer it to be delivered to your door they will do so for only 1 although I cannot comment on the speed of delivery Overall if its an Indian youre after look no further you have found something heavenlyNoor was my Indian of choice for the first two years of my uni life and while now I will occasionally stray from it Ill always end up crawling back The curries are huge well cooked and really cheap Although they are arguably not as sophisticated as many other curry houses they still make a mean Dopiaza and friendsFound on Nicholson street it clearly caters to students and the prices reflect this You can get a meal deal with a curry and rice or nan for 695 and one will more than fill all but but the fattest of fatties As well as this they and a la carte menu with all the normal curries and a few specialities The sauces are great really creamy and rich without being over the top All the traditional curries are done exceptionally and whilst I am yet to sample their specialities I look forward to it They also do all the sides you could want with a variety of nan breads and pakoras bhajis samosas etc for vvery reasonable prices The staff are really nice and the service is very quick combine this with excellent food and thats a winner in my book"

    "review":"Chez Jules is an absolute gem of a restaurant Situated on Hanover Street Chez Jules is right in the centre of the New Town and is just around the corner from the main shopping street in Edinburgh Princes Street and so it is a convenient place to reach Chez Jules is a French bistro which I first visited a few months ago and I will definitely be going back again soon The menu offers an excellent choice of authentic French dishes including French onion soup bouillabaisse and fillet steaks I came here lunch and I ordered a seafood crepe which i thought sounded a wee bit odd on the menu but I tried it and it was truly amazing The fish were cooked perfectly and tasted really fresh and there was a delicious sauce with it  yummy And it came with fries  score I had the chocolate mouse for dessert which was equally delicious and left me wanting more The prices vary with soups and starters coting less than 5 and most main dishes are around 10 but some main meals can cost 20 which is pretty pricey Chez Jules is a great wee bistro and an excellent place to get a little taste of FranceVery nice ambiance fast service and delicious French food Their steaks are amazing as well as their gratin dauphinois I know French cuisine well and I have to say that this restaurant makes quite authentic French dishes so its definitely worth a try Prices are good affordable Id recommend to book a table before going for dinner as it can get very busy even on week days As a French I really thought this was a great place so Ill certainly go againAbsolutely gorgeous atmosphere and the wine selection was excellent The French Onion was fantastic but my main of sirloin steak was not to my taste and the price of it was indeed steepWe loved this warm friendly restaurant The food was delicious with generous portions at reasonable prices My husband had the tritip steak and I had the mussels Both were perfect The atmosphere of the place is warm and welcomingI had heard so many wonderful things about Chez Jules so I thought it was about time that I check them out I love the vibe inside so much art work on the walls and dimmed lighting It has such a cosy feeling inside As soon as we were settled at our table bread olives lettuce and salami was brought to our able which was a lovely touch We all ended up ordering steak and I was pleased to find the service was really quick as I was one hungry lady The rump steak was delicious and cooked exactly how I wanted it to be I ended up getting some fries on the side which were pretty lovely too After our mains we ordered some coffee but I couldnt exactly not have a dessert I ended up going for the crepe which was incredibly tasty but I did find it odd that I was given a spoon for it The spoon was perfect for the ice cream which was quite possible the tastiest ice cream but made eating my crepe a little on the tricky side Overall a great little find and I can see myself going back pretty soonOn my recent trip to Edinburgh my cousin brought me round some of her favourite restaurants in Edinburgh One of them was Chez Jules a casual friendly bistro that offers classic French dishesInside there are pillars and blackboards on which menus and specials are scrawled in colourful chalk The lighting is dimmed in the evenings with a wine bottle drip candle holder on each table to add a bit of a romantic ambienceUpon being seated we were served their standard complimentary starters of bread and butter olives and sliced salami and a heavily dressed bowl of lettuce leavesViv started with the grilled goats cheese which was served on toast with balsamic and sesame dressing There was a subtle sweetness from the honey and the walnuts added a bit of a crunchy texture I went for the sauteed homemade duck confit leg with fresh thyme and garlic A lovely piece of tender meat served with a side of mustard to add a bit of spice to itThe steak tartare was finely chopped and you could taste the luscious flavour of the meat lightly spiced with Worchester sauce chilli shallots and garlic mayoSlow braised French rabbit leg with Dijon mustard white wine and smoked bacon with gratin dauphinois Delicious flavours and succulent meat and the crisp bread that it was served on nicely soaked up all that lovely sauceWe were really full after all that food that we unfortunately did not have space for dessertOverall we both enjoyed our meal there  the food was simple and satisfying and it has a really chilled and relaxing atmosphereClick on blog link for full post x http:dancinginhighheelsblogspotcouk"

    "review":"Excellent beer Excellent food And an excellent atmosphere Really gives credence to the word gastropub Highly recommended for those in need of a fine dining experience in a barI live close by and thought when a friend visited me from the States that is was time to try it out We arrived on a Saturday night after 8 and managed to get a table for 3 The interior is nice and clean not hip in anyway but definitely not a pub gastropub yes The menu is small and I would class it as a tad above average pricesThe menu has a mix of what you would expect at a pub just slightly varied to more foodie I think ie the tempura battered fish and chips I ordered We ordered some beers on tap all of which were nice served slightly warm and each was tasty It seemed busy but the food arrived quickly and was nicely presented The fish was really well friedprepared and the chips are good the mushy peas received mix reviews because lots of whole grained mustard had been mixed in to them I love peas so no need to add to them especially since the mustard didnt really fit My partner got the burger and it was really well cooked still pink which he appreciated and it had a chutney on it which was nice My friend also got the fish and enjoyed it We were pretty full but opted to try the sticky toffee pudding as it is something a visiting friend should try it arrived and was absolutely massive And absolutely delicious served with ice cream and lots of sauce it was very tasty and a nice finish to the mealI was pleasantly surprised by this place and might not go often but would definitely recommend itFriendly staff a welcoming atmosphere a good drink selection and a lovely ever changing menu Whats not to like about the CaleyI visit here once or twice a month and its definitely one of the nicest bars in the area Its relaxed cosy and welcomes dogs If you dont have the appetite for a meal then the bar menu is worth a try huge portions and everything is freshly hand made Im a big fan of the pitta bread and hummusDecided to return for munchies and am now a true disciple of this place  Lovely welcome from staff great beer and very good food  The fish platter impressed as did the chorizo stuffed chicken on barley  risotto  The vodka soaked berry ice cream Sunday took me to another place altogether Really very good  No wonder the CSR has won so many awards and continues to invest in quality and serviceGood foodGood BeerBad when the football kicks out Decent times to be had unless you pop in when there is a football game kicking out Then it gets fuller than a gerbils cheek after eating baby sweetcornI wanted to like the Caley Sample Rooms much more than I actually did I had the mushroom burger with the stingiest piece of halloumi ever and a pretty dull bun The SR opted for a brunch  smoked salmon and scrambled eggs which left him disappointed Onion rings showed up a good ten  fifteen minutes later than everything else Meh Did like the beer options here though  maybe one day well return for beer instead"

    "review":"My husband and I had a wonderful time at this Italian restaurant  The food was delicious and authentic and the staff made us feel so comfortable  It was our favorite restaurant in EdinburghFrizzante was a great find on my first trip to Edinburgh The owners and staff are so friendly and are quick to make recommendations on entrees and wine selections My team and I travel to Edinburgh often and always make a visit here  The food is outstanding and they have a great selection to choose from If you are in the mood for Italian I truly recommend this place I have tried several other Italian restaurants in the area and none compareNot just great food but great service and Pasquale owner and Olivia waitress were amazing Well worth the visit to this localDiscovered this place before Christmas when it was under different ownership and loved it was just as impressed when we returned The service was great the food was amazing and the staff were so friendly Go there anytime Im in Edinburgh nowDont be put off by the unassuming storefront entrance that opens up to a simple dining room  The food here is wonderful  The menu offers a generous offering of classic Italian dishes freshly prepared on site I was particularly delighted with the glutenfree options that allowed my first meal of pasta in some time  A great choice for a lovely meal in EdinburghThis little spot is a gem We had dinner 2 adults 1 9 year old and everyone was happy Seafood pasta was great HUGE portion Caprese salad was fresh and delicious also large Pizza was only OK  good but nothing special Didnt have room for desert but wish we had  they all looked great They will do most pastas with glutenfree penne for a small charge which made my life easier Service was friendly and efficient Excellent food Definitely worth a visit"

    "review":"Great food service atmosphereI had the corn and chicken soupit was wonderful  Try the scallops with black bean sauceBeing chinese food snobs from New York we were stunned to find such great chinese food in ScotlandOur family eats out at Chinese on a regular basis This restaurant was nothing over the to but definitely better than the other reviews would lead you to believe  The aromatic duck was slightly overlooked but tasted great  The pork was cooked perfectly and the dry fried green beans were outstanding Great garlic mix and a nice spice to themEverything had a terrific flavour that was enjoyableI would return to this location againI have always had a nice meal here I am not a fan of their chicken satay too much pineapple for my liking but I enjoy the Singapore Fried Rice Roast Duck in spicy chilli sauce Chicken Curry  Lar Chee Lamb and  the Pork Char Siu with Szechuan Sauce Their dumplings rival Chop Chop I especially like the way they cook the fried rice very light and fluffy and not greasy like some places The staff are friendly and courteous and will have a joke with you if you are a relaxed diner The manager knows her regulars well and chats and jokes with them"

    "review":"Ive been quite a harsh critic of Greggs in my previous reviews of some of their Glasgow branches For the most part I stick by my opinions that the staff are generally hostile the food revolting and that the continued success of the company will result in shorter lives for us allIn a dramatic twist of fate though this particular branch has provided me with a few pleasant surprises I once managed to get a morning roll with proper crispy bacon and their new cake the maple pecan slice is approximately one hundred times tastier than anything else Ive ever eaten from herePerhaps most shockingly of all the staff were actually quite friendly and cheerful despite their obvious feelings of misery Good work GreggsI have always been a huge fan of Greggs Mexican chicken oval bite I did go off Greggs all together a while ago but my cravings for the oval bites are back with a vengence and Ive been getting them for lunch every other day the past couple of weeks At 190 theyre very reasonable and surprisingly filling even though theyre not that much too look at This branch is well stocked and has a good selection of cakes too I got a super tasty Empire Biscuit the other week and the icing was super moist yumTypical Greggs I guess but this one has a good selection and the staff are friendly tooGreggs is one of the big bakery chains in Edinburgh Things going for this particular store:centralcheap food with good meal dealsfast serviceThis not so good: bad location in front of a busy bus stop Its quite small for the flow of business it receives and ques at lunch time all the way outside rude service although quite understandable with the variety of often rude clientele There are other more interesting sandwich places quite close by These basically some up my points Its ideal if you are hungry and need a snack immediately then head here for something warm and satisfying The cupcakes are fairly decent as wellWoahhhh the cheapness of Greggs sends me in to a frenzyIn the beginning of my stay in Edinburgh I expected the quality to be subpar because how else can one explain a sausage role for 058 Its crazy that one can buy a sizeable snack at Greggs even if all you have in your pocket is a little jingle jingleApart from the sausage rolls which are pretty awesome Im a big fan of the cheese and onion pasty as well as the ham and cheese bake I cant count the number of times Ive snuck a Greggs pastry into the school library Then theres the sweet counter with lots of cupcakes and muffins Greggs is about 70 years old and is a chain bakery with several outlets in Edinburgh The only issue I have is that as busy as they are the shops are quite small with lines sometimes extending to the door However service is extremely quick albeit impersonal For what they sell and at the price they do Im definitely a grateful fanOh Greggs I owe you oneIve lost count of the amount of times this place has sorted me out Its hangover food essentially but damn good hangover food They have brilliant sandwiches that are all made fresh daily and their cakes are yummy Their sausage rolls are what save my lifeThis place is almost always full of students looking for their fix Its always busy and the staff are lovely You cant really go wrong with GreggsThis is a great Greggs location Ive stopped in many times usually in the morning right when they open I have to say that first off the staff here is quite nice I like them They are friendly and that makes a big difference in the morning when you are just starting your day They handle big queues better than a lot of places in town The line move quickly and they work to get everyone on their way happily One thing to note: this location has a lot of little old ladies that stop in for coffee in the morning probably longer than Ive been alive and there appears to be many other regulars here That is something usually only good service can bring about So I do trust this location for that reason Same people every morning stop in I like their doughnuts sausage rolls steak and cheese rolls and even their pizzas It is almost always fresh when I order and the prices are unbeatable Seriously No one even comes close to their prices They have great sandwich deals as well with a drink for well under 500 I like this Greggs location and plan on being back Probably in the morning"

    "review":"Slow ass service in here like really really slow I actually started reading the menu I got so bored All I wanted was some mixed veg noodles When I got the food home I was brutally disappointed The veg tasted frozen and the noodles were pure mush Only go if nowhere else is openI came to Jade Palace less than a month ago after an evening at the pub and the service is actually pleasant and fast  Its a really popular Chinese takeaway on Dalkeith Road which gets loads of service from the locals so it must be doing something right  The menu has a good selection of the usual dishes and in particular a great range of szechuan dishes which are all spicy and delicious  I went for the chicken szechuan with special fried rice and a bag of prawn crackers which cost around 7  It took less than ten minutes to arrived and tasted great  The chillies must have been as fesh as they come because the sauce for the chicken just about blew my head off yet was still delicious  Id certainly come here again as its a great place to come for a quick tasty mealCraving something different from the usual Indian takeaways I usually go for I decided to try out Jade Palace as it is located right next to my girlfriends flat  My main experience of Chinese food has been courtesy of Jimmy Chungs and as this is pretty much mass produced I expected something a little different from Jade Palace However I was disappointed  The cantonese style  sweet and sour I had was certainly nothing to get too excited about and the friend rice I had alongside was also fairly unspectacular although still fairly nice to eat  The prawn crackers were also very similar to those that I could buy from the supermarket for about half the price  The saving grace was the curry sauce and noodles that my girlfriend ordered  The curry sauce was deliciously smooth and not grainy as is often the case The noodles proved to be jammed tight into the foil container and as a result the portion was very generous The prices seemed fairly standard: they did not strike me as particularly cheap but they also did not make my jaw drop to the floor as other Chinese takeaways have done  Overall if youre nearby and are desperately craving a bit of Chinese takeaway this is fine However if possible shop around first to avoid too much disappointmentThis is the worst Chinese takeaway in Edinburgh I went there once with a few friends big mistake The people seemed all right and the food didnt take too long to come It was apparent why when we got back home All our food was undercooked the beef and Im being generous calling it that in particular Consequently all of us spent the rest of the night in the bathroom involuntarily ejecting any last remnant of that godawful food and whatever else was in our stomach at the same timeSave yourself an evening of misery pain and bodily eruptions and stay well clear of this placeAs far as Chinese restaurants go in Edinburgh look no further  They have some of the best items in town  The only reason that I give them three stars is because they have an over saturated menu  They have several really good items but those are surround by even more bad ones so if you are not in the know you may end up having a bad experience  That being said I could never get enough of the Honey Chili Chicken  There is also no seating so it is only takeout and delivery  But that was never a problem for me as I lived in the area and would always just drop into pick it up on the way homeStaying with family who ordered take out from this Chinese as we were guests  Should have checked yelp and trusted the reports on this take away as I agree this place is not great  I had the Cantonese sweet and sour prawns not good  The special fried rice was stodgy and tasteless The chicken chow mien was grey in colour and grey in taste if u get my drift  The spring roll was a good size but the prawns in it were shrivelled and tasted rubbery All in all this Chinese is not a cheap take out with food that is disappointing Xoxo"

    "review":"Itchycoo is a restaurant bar with a new food menu that focuses on fresh local produce We started with deepfried softshell crab and a mixed salad featuring dried cranberries walnuts and blue cheese For mains which we both particularly enjoyed it was pan fried sea bass and rump of lamb Dessert was a dark chocolate tartlet and something called munch which turned out to be many little tasty desserty things on a plate Many items on the menu can be ordered as either main or starter portions which I thought was a lovely idea I ended up having 2 startersized portions for both courses and it was more than enough to fill me upOh and they have a lot of cocktails The cocktails which are welldone classics for the most part are about averagepriced for the city Ive tried several and I think the raspberry mojito is my favorite so far Service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable if a tad slow at times Disappointments: 1 None of the vegetarian mains looked particularly exciting though to be fair I havent tried them  perhaps they are absolutely thrilling to eat2 No local beers on tap Would love to see these added someday  I could definitely see us spending a sunny afternoon at one of their outdoor tables on the Royal Mile sipping beer and peoplewatchingI visited Itchycoo this afternoon with the lovely Julie G and we had a lovely afternoon so much so that we stayed and chatted in the lounge for several hours whilst savouring our afternoon tea and cocktails I love the tradition of afternoon tea and it is always fantastic to indulge in an afternoon of eating sandwiches scones and cakes Itchycoo has taken the afternoon tea to a new level by letting you bypass the actual tea or coffee and skipping directly on to the cocktails This is a fantastic idea hey if youre going for a decadent afternoon filled with cake why not go all the way and get a cocktail too Itchycoos cocktail list was lovely and I couldnt decide between the Death by Chocolate or the Espresso Martini The waiter helped me decide on the Death by Chocolate cocktail  it was fabulous rich and decadent and definitely fit what I was looking forAfter the cocktails arrived our cake tower was paraded out to us It was a beautiful array and selection I think its a general feature that the sandwiches at an afternoon tea are usually a letdown The vegetarian versions we had were fine but nothing stood out We then moved on to the scone tier The scones were tasty but could have been a bit more fluffy and fresh Itchycoo did very well with the cakes though which are always meant to steal the show anyway lets face it We had a banoffee pie a fruit pie meringues and carrot cake I liked them in that order too with the meringues and the carrot cake both being fabulous I was a tad disappointed that there was nothing chocolate included in the cake range but then again my Death by Chocolate cocktail helped make up for thatWe really enjoyed sitting by the lovely windows in the lounge rather than in the dark bar area However  since we opted to sit farther away from the bar we were a bit neglected by service and had to ask three times for some tap water However that could have been because of the location we chose Still I wasnt thrilled in the service because I had originally made the reservation for 3pm but then tried to move it later to 4pm but was told that they were completely booked out for afternoon that afternoon so werent able to let us come later This was disappointing especially because the whole time we were there it was extremely quiet with plenty of space at other tables so they easily could have accommodated us an hour later The online service was excellent though because the Radisson Bleu Edinburghs social media people are really on it and were excited to have us come as they should beReally disappointing afternoon tea Between two people we had 9 stale white bread sandwiches cheese and pickle ham and tomato salmon two dry tasteless supermarket style cupcakes 2 tasty banoffee pies two sticky ginger cakes and 2 mini macarons Oh and some clotted cream and jam for the scones we didnt have I think we were given extra sandwiches because of this but really theres only so much stale bread u can eat Both our hot drinks were cool Even at our groupon voucher price it was a poor show"

    "review":"Zizzis is one of those chains a bit like pizza express or prezzo thats easy and familiar and nearly always has some sort of offer on They have a few different restaurants in Edinburgh but tonight for the first time I visited their Roxburgh Court restaurant which opened last year Its tucked away off the Royal Mile down Mary Kings Close I was surprised at the lack of signs for it on the Royal Mile but I quite liked the way it was tucked away Like I mentioned these restaurants always have some sort of offer on so in we went armed with our 50 off voucherThe place was lovely inside and staff were very friendly as we entered The menu was much the same as any Zizzis restaurant filled with pizzas pastas calzones risottos and a few meat and fish dishes We started with delicious mozarella garlic bread this had got to be the BEST garlic bread ever I big wooden platter laden with melty gooey caramelised oniony garlicky goodness The portion is super huge so could do for 2 people probably more but hey once youve tasted it youll not want to share too much We also got some delicious calamari with a lemony mayo The mains were great too I was there with my family and we got a whole mixture of pizzas and pastas They do lovely thin rustica pizzas and my mum had something called a spiedini which was a sort of hanging skewer with prawns salmon sea bream pepper and courgettes At the end of the meal my Gran told us it was the best pasta she had ever eaten so they were doing something right We finished off with some gelato to share and it was lovely if a little smallThe restaurant has a lovely view out across Princes Street and the Balmoral and we saw some Edinburgh trams passing by With it being a large chain you sort of know what to expect with Zizzis and its not maybe the most exciting place to eat Saying that they have some great offers and the food is tasty I think this restaurant was nicer than other branches I have been tolike the sightseeingAfter climbing up the steps I need time to get my breath back and then its taking away again with a great view of the Scotts monument and princes St Tucked away from the city rumblings its not too busy and you can always get a table at lunch by walking in from the street They always have an offer on and I always seem to forget about it so I could be saving myself a small fortune  Zizzis is a chain so its a simple menu Its one of the few chains I like Any pizza or pasta dish or actually any dish Ive ordered has been good and tasty I like looking at the specials board to see if there is anything new on the board to try Its handy to meet mates and grab a quick working lunch although weve had to chase to pay the bill when we need to leave"

    "review":"A new and very welcome addition to Newington takeaways  fast food but healthy Thats their aim and they succeed very well Only been once so far but was hugely impressed at the tastiness and quality of what I had The big plus for me is that you can get something a bit more substantial than a sandwich and they plan to open later than the sandwichcoffee places nearby without going for something as big and potentially unhealthy as a chippie kebab Chinese or Indian You get a choice of fillings in a choice of naan wrap or panini which gives a fair bit of scope for experimentation and they all look a lot more filling than a sandwich for about the same price 350 Plus friendly staff nice drinks and a loyalty card I think my loyalty card will be getting well usedFood for a Fiver List:Everything Burritos wraps baguettes paninis toasties  salads is under 5 poundsFlip should do better its really underrated There arent many places around that allow you to eat healthily This week alone I saw deep fried pizza which I had heard about but never actually saw and melted cheese on sushi Amazing Flip has great prices its totally customizable and it can be as healthy as you want it to be They even have brown baguettes which I cant recall seeing anywhere else They can also accommodate any kind of intoleranceallergydiet The guy behind the counter had to be the owner he was really friendly and clearly loves the place The outside looks outdated the decor just looks like a random mix of things and the counter has a window which in most places is used as a display but here its just a functional refrigerator which isnt as pretty as other places might be I dont care about any of these things and to be honest they probably help to keep the prices down so yaaay Ive never had anything bad here which makes sense since you pick everything in it but its also just much better quality than you would expect for the price especially the meat It was a relief to find this place as usually its a struggle to find something you wont feel bad about 5 mins laterAlso theres wifiIts certainly healthier than a pizza  chippy  kebab and its fairly quick so I would recommend giving them a chance if you are in the area We parked our bums down inside to eat and the place itself has a good vibe we also had some easy chat with the staff about their food philosophy and a bit of general banter The price was good so that made me worry that the food itself would be cheaply made or not a lot of it but it was very satisfactory If Im honest the menu system was slightly confusing or too much like hard work for this zombieconsumer who prefers to point grunt then eat My girlfriend either ordered the wrong thing as a consequence or was given the wrong thing because of this system and shes not as daft as me She ate it and enjoyed it anyway though Ill go backEverything on the previous review stands plus they have improved the look of the place including the weird display thing Just a great place healthy convenient cheapIve been past this place more than once and today I was finally feeling hungry as I went past so I decided to pop in for a wrap for lunchThe wide variety of fillings on offer the friendly and efficient staff the fact that my wrap was pretty damn tastyyep this place is pretty great Will be back next time Im in the areaIve been in Edinburgh three weeks now and I have already been here too many times to mention with a loyalty card the 9th meal is free its quick easy cheap and especially with chimmichurri sauce very tasty The staff are friendly and genuine while I was having my steak wrap I was being told of a the pubs bars and sites I should visit and where to avoid when August rolls around This place is simply made of win"

    "review":"Lebowskis is quite a recent and welcome addition to the Edinburgh barpub scene It takes its name from the Coen brothers film The Big Lebowski and those in the know will spot signs of this influence The bar sells no fewer than nineteen different kinds of white Russian cocktails all of which take their name from the film The Dude himself makes an appearance on this list In addition to the cocktails they also serve a really lovely cloudy cider on draught Theyve put almost as much thought into the food menu as the amusing list of cocktails everything is fresh and there is a focus on using Scottish produce Ayrshire ham smoked Mull cheddar etc The chunky tats are great to have with a pint if youre feeling peckish I ordered them expecting a bowl of bland pub chips but they are actually crispy potato wedges with the skin left on  flavourful and fillingLebowskis is a good place to go for a bite to eat before catching a film at the Cameo or a show at the Usher Hall or LyceumAfter hearing about this place from a few locals if you like White Russians YOU MUST GOTheyre menu for extensive for White Russians I had no idea there could be so many possible ways to make them There is probably 1530 different ways they have them listed It will forever change your way and your idea how to spice up a classic cocktail I had two :Cosy booths to be sat at here  We came here for a little refreshment after dinner  Id heard of the White Russians a few times from here and they were meant to be good So thats what I ordered Theres no dance floor to shake that booty So I just nod my head to the beat Besides the seats are comfy and the conversations a flowing Im struggling with the volume of music to hear the conversation hence there must be a speaker blasting out the tunes Good tunes at that too So cant complain too much Its a pretty chilled out place so would come back for some drinks and maybe even try and shake a little bootyLebowskis is a killer place for a White Russian With friendly and knowledgable staff behind the counter none of this sigh I dont really fancy shaking a cocktail thing they really are good at what they do I think this is as good a place as any for a few drinks any day of the weekIve been here twice so far once on a quiet Sunday afternoon where there were plenty of free tables and once on a Friday night where it was absolutely jammers and all of the tables where either taken or reservedSo far I have sampled the Classic the Dude the Police Chief and the Toe The Toe is definitely my favourite a chocmint concoction that tastes more milkshake than alcoholic beverageI havent yet tried the food here but despite reading some not so great reviews the menu looks lovely a bargain lunch deal for a fiver and it smells delish when wafting past so I definitely intend on doing so eventuallyI will definitely try this place again and I recommend you do too dude5 stars for ambience and for the menu Great music5 stars for the fine Caucasians White Russians I highly recommend the Walters2 stars for the food I had the Lebowski burger and I couldnt finish it Had a weird tang to it and the bun was burnt  My husband had the fish burger and it was dry  The blue cheese salad was good but bacon wasnt actually crispyOverall 4 stars  Happy we went but we wont be returningI was originally drawn to this place because I am a huge fan of The Big Lebowski but wanted to go even more after I saw the menu The food sounded delicious and I was excited to try it I went on a Friday night and was told that the kitchen closed at least an hour ago even though it was still pretty early in the night and I literally saw someone else successfully order good not even five minutes before Even though we were beyond hungry we decided to stay for a couple drinks because the White Russians looked too good to pass up I tried The Toe and The Donny and my god they were delicious I personally prefer drinks where you cant really taste the alcohol and these tasted like candy I was pretty disappointed about not being able to try the food but the drinks were great"

    "review":"Read below: only reason not five stars is the cost Have to order separate fries for already high priced burgerSo I just arrived at Byron and my initial impression is excellent The girl at the door is beautiful friendly and kind Nicely chatty as she seats me The waiter is kind as well although a little over the top calling me my man and trying to be cheeky Altogether nice friendly peopleChocolate Shake: I opted for the nonalcoholic version though perhaps Ill come back Excellent thick and rich Truly American styleEXCEPT: we would serve our shakes in a glass shake glass not in the metal tin it which it was mixed At most we would add the tin to the side in case there was extra that doesnt fit in the cup Excellent choice otherwiseByron Burger: the house special Definitely the best burger Ive had in Scotland Tasted delicious Not over cooked slightly pink inside There IS something missing and I cant quite place it although I suspect it is that the grill is too clean so you dont have the excess grease that adds so much flavor to burgers in the states Also Ive been to 49 of the 50 States Never have had shredded lettuce on a regular burger before I dont think we shred it at homeSweet Potato Fries: Delicious Perfectly cooked The staff now is a bit over zealousits been two minutes since I got my burger and four people have stopped by to make sure everything is okayCOMPLAINT: for the price 995 burger 395 shake choice of fries should come with the burger This would be normal in the Statesno one charges extra for fries unless you order a larger basket than just a side So the only reason its not five stars is the cost Some of the staff are dressed in plain street clothes I suspect they are management of some sortthey dont even look like they work herejust lingering around oddly PUT ON SOME BYRONs clothingAfter being turned away from Cosmo we trekked up to the Old Town end of North Bridge and entered Byron which was empty at the peak of lunchtime surprisinglyIt took a few minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us but once we were noticed we were taken to a cosy booth at the front Since I had previously eaten at the Newcastle Byron I knew how everything worked I ordered a cheeseburger with skinon hand cut chips They were both very nice Im glad that the burger was on a plate and that the chips were in a nice pot Also the cheese was actually REAL British cheddar None of that processed American nonsense It took about 10 minutes for our order to come through I noticed a dumbwaiter near the stairs to the toilets so the kitchen is probably in the basement Maybe thats way the toilet corridor smelled a bit like cheese To drink I had a very large salted caramel milkshake which was really rich and thick Thats how a milkshake should be The cups are huge though I was expecting something about the size of a large IKEA glass but the actual size was way better than I expected Toilets are in the basement and are in 7 separate cubicles 4 of them are designated for women and 3 are for men The mens toilets are inconveniently located all the way at the end of the corridor and it is quite long so I sprinted to the other end when I ventured down thereThe stairs down to the toilets are very poorly lit and were a bit greasy and slippery I would suggest that they add more lighting in that areaThe atmosphere is a sort of chic retro diner style with black and white tiled paths up to the bar and through the seating area and birch flooring in the dining room The ceiling has lots of pipes and things on it with hip decorations and stuffThank you Byron for a nice meal Might I add that our waiters were helpful friendly and quickOk lets talk about the great: Staff are some of the best in Edinburgh they were chatty enthusiastic good at their job and proud of the food they were serving They seem like a good team and I hope that Byron encourages this sense of happiness as I feel that the staff will bring back repeat customers rather than the foodThe burgers were ok verging on meh Maybe I have been spoiled with good burgers but I was not overwhelmed We got plain fries because my partner is weird and does not like the sweet potato variety I know right and they were kind of tasteless and boringBen got a milkshake and it was HUGE but the plain vanilla was just slightly melted cheap vanilla icecream Not overly convinced we will be backCool new hamburger place on the Royal Mile We attended for a quiz night which was good fun The place seems popular it was full up and the servers were clearly quite busy trying to keep up with all the ordersBecause we had eaten we only ordered milkshakes These are great nice and thick just as they should be Theyre served in metal containers and are very filling on their ownService is good a little slow due to how busy it was but friendly The place can get quite loud I struggled to hear questions most of the time due to the noise I enjoyed being able to see the chefs at work It all feels very open and welcoming for this reasonPrices are high as many reviewers have said Theres no doubt about that When youre talking over 10 for a burger excluding chips thats simply too much for me to stomach The burgers did seem nice and I heard good reviews from those that did order them though Milkshakes as I said were delicious and cost around 5 if I remember correctlyObviously Byron is doing pretty well as they are opening another branch on Lothian Road Good luck to themEdinburgh continues to embracing the burger trend with the latest addition from London chain Byron It falls somewhere between the mainstream chains like handmade burgerGBK and the more independent places like Bread Meats Bread Its better than most of the chains but if you want the very best in Edinburgers then other options are better I would definitely be happy coming back here though Its modern looking clean and I liked the decor Somewhere in between a nice bar and an American diner Fun but not in your face There is a good selection of beersbourbons to drinkI had the spicy burger Its was mediumrare satisfyingly pink and juicy It had a slight kick but didnt really justify the server warning me that when I ordered it I appreciated the fact that buying this burger donated a meal to charity its the kind of thing would make me want to choose Byron over other chainsThe courgette fries were the best of the sides  basically just deep fried in batter The french fries were adequate but nothing too special Coleslaw was a bit of a let down though I had the vanilla shake as a dessert because its clearly not a drink  its a huge metal glass of smushy icecream Good though I may try it with added bourbon next time Apparently thats a thing Overall I liked it here Its not cheap but doesnt feel overpriced in comparison to the competition I was enjoyed the burger and liked the ambianceWith such a sought out location slap bang in the middle of the royal mile Byron burgers opened its doors on a rainy Saturday night in January Ive been to quite a couple of their branches in London and have always left feeling satisfied with meaty goodness The Edinburgh branch is no exception and visiting certainly filled a huge gap Id advise on getting the sweet potato fries as a side as theyre particularly yummy The burgers come as medium as standard so I asked for medium rare which Id also advise you do to get that desired pink middle that all burgers should have The gfod overall was good Its certainly nothing mind blowing but its better than your usual tourist trap that I imagine the royal mile is full of Ive also got to mention the service Im pretty sure its because of it being their opening night but my goodness they were attentive A little like the stepford wives of the waitingon world we were greeted and served by two very lovely but very over the top waitresses throughout the meal Very enthusiastic if a little invasive but Im sure that will tire in time"

    "review":"At 1350 for 3 courses the January sale here was definitely good value for money and at 13:30 on a Friday the place was virtually full so had clearly caught a number of eyes Id been interested in paying it a visit for a while so my birthday offered a good opportunity Servicewise I got the impression that an extra member of staff would have made quite a difference  my starter arrived near instantaneously after it was ordered tasty oxtail terrine so I suppose it was just a question of slicing it and delivering it to the table yet the main courses took far longer than youd normally expect Our waitress was though very able They were good when they got there though  my no nonsense duck and beans went down a treat My parents both enjoyed the apple tarts they had for dessert but felt that the main course fish could have down with more veg or the option of a sideorder of such Within the terms of the deal the cheese board was fine and certainly had enough biscuits but 5 for brie and something unnamed even with the blob of quince jelly would I think have seemed too much to pay on its own We had a pleasant Merlot to wash it all down but having no wine cheaper than 1550 is I think something else that this establishment needs to look at particularly in these financially straitened timesIve been here two years in a row for work Christmas lunch and this place is great I dont know why I havent visited at other times of the yearReservations are easily made and the staff are well organised with prebooked and preordered food so we always know what were getting and when Food comes out at a decent pace and all of got our courses at the same time so there was no awkward waiting around ages for someone to get theres before you start The drinks also flowed at a good pace which helpsThe quality of the food is bloody brilliant I havent looked at the regular menu but the 3 course Christmas lunch is only 1750 and for that I had a seafood flan started a perfectly cooked duck leg main and a satisfying vacherin dessertRight thats it  Im off to book a table for January for a proper dinnerI was quite apprehensive about going here because its French and the French are known for their exquisite and sophisticated cuisine Im quite a fussy eater so I wasnt sure if there would be anything I would like on the menuI started off with the soup Parsnip and Cauliflower I dont usually go for cauliflower and it was great It was rich and creamy but not too creamy The bread supplied was good but it wasnt warm I then had the cheek of beef for my main course I have never had beef so tender before My knife just fell through it The vegetables were a bit too crunchy for me and a bit tasteless I havent had creme brulee before so I had it for dessert here It was gorgeous So creamy and disgustingly sweet but I like sweet things The wine was good too I would have given it four stars but the food was just a bit too rich for me if you get me I wasnt feeling very well the next day Perhaps good food just isnt for the wee lassie from PaisleyVery disappointing Christmas Eve dinner Lovely venuebut food was meh and service was worse IA rainy summers day in Edinburgh Im not here for the comedy festival so I expected not to get in but they were very accommodating I skipped the starter and has the Coley for my main course and some yummy cheeses for dessert Gorgeous Great service and timed perfectly The waitress even went through my cheeses describing and naming each of them Looking forward to my cheese dreams :Service is efficient and prompt and quite attentive The setting and the ambience isnt pretentious like youd expect from a well renowned French restaurant Its very down to earth with a nice view of Old town Edinburgh We ordered Pigeon breast with Apple  spinach Which was amazing and the Apple didnt taste like an apple and the red wine reduction was nice as well I had a cauliflower soup which was very smooth and light and didnt taste like cauliflower and was full of flavor For the mains we ordered Fillet of pork pork cheeks  pork trotters This was a small portion but full of flavor It was also very filling for a small portion I had a duck leg casserole with lots of beans and sausage in there Apparently this is the most tradition homemade grandmas kitchen type of dish from the south of France But I did prefer the Fillet of pork better Very nice restaurant and the staff was very friendly and were keen to explain things voluntarily without even being asked Which was a nice departure from the typical stoic abrasive service weve received so far in Edinburgh"

    "review":"Whilst I reckon there are better tapas places in Edinburgh this is the only tapasGreek combination Im aware of and the dessert I finished up with last week was fantastically indulgent so it gains marks for thatThe service throughout was attentive and informative when it came to questions about the ingredients etc and the range of dishes available is good an variedYoure probably best not sitting by the windows on cold days though as the height of the place means its a struggle keep it evenly heated which was probably the case in its previous incarnation tooTapame is definitely my goto tapas bar in Edinburgh There are plenty of options on the menu and its easy to work your way through the menu with its sharing style Any dish we have ordered has arrived piping hot and extremely tasty with one portion more than enough to shareThe staff here are very friendly and attentive and on our third visit they even remembered our names Its a great spot for a relaxing catch up with friends or family and weve never had any issue with securing a seat without a reservationI popped into Tapame with a group after work and was pleasantly surprisedThe menu is small but with lots of variety and all the dishes we ordered as a table were delicious  I particularly enjoyed the pulled pork pitta and the patatas were easily large enough for two to share As with all tapas some of the dishes do seem a little overpriced but when you consider that youll end up sharing everything it works out as pretty affordable  I paid 17 for two small glasses of wine a starter and two mainsIm surprised that others had issues with the service  our waiters were both really attentive and seemed knowledgeable about the dishes on offer although the restaurant was pretty quietOverall Id definitely recommend checking Tapame out although Ill likely be waiting a while due to the limited menuThe food when it arrived was pretty good However the service was really crap When we walked in we were seated at a table near the open door We shortly realized there was a freezing draft near the door it was a bone chilling 13 degrees out in the middle of August  and asked if they would close the door We were told it was not possible as the open door was keeping the kitchen cool Then we asked if we could move to an empty table in the back and were told yes but then immediately no because a table of 5 had just walked in So we stayed put and ordered jackets and sweaters on Then for nearly 30 minutes almost no food arrived after 15 minutes one dish of the 7 we had ordered did arrive all while we watched the table of 5 in the back get served everything they ordered and complete their meal  We finally inquired of the manager who explained to us that A there had been a rush just before we arrived so the kitchen was behind and in explanation of why the people after us had been served that B they had children and had requested quick service in order to be within the legal requirement to leave the restaurant at 10 PM However at the moment she told us this it was only 9:25 Even while she was standing there talking to us the other table was already gathering their things to leave Finally in drips and drabs the food came out As I said we enjoyed the food overall though the red pepper appetizer was a joke: a tiny smear of spread on the plate accompanied by two toasts: they would have been better off serving them as crostini with the smear on top At least the presentation might have fooled us On the other hand Im sure none of us will return or recommend it to friends The restaurant has been open for far too long now for the service to be that bad Sorryit was after 8pm on a thursday evening and i along with fellow book club members were full of wine beer infatuation with jilly cooper and the need for some food  being in the uni area we were directed towards Tapame for a delightful tapa dinneri was told this place used to be favourit which id never visited but the refurb looks lovely  its a good sized space with exposed brick walls and a chic sort of interior  i was a bit tipsy perhaps so my memory of the venue may be the tiniest bit hazy  however the wait staff were absolutely lovely and showed us to a table at the back of the restuarantwe ordered a number of tapas between the four of us and a bottle of wine  its worth mentioning that the bottle of wine was 11 and more than drinkable so excellent value for quality  tapas arrived fairly quickly and we all tucked in  my favourite were the sliced potatoes topped with some greek cheese and the meatballs  we also had a massive cheeseboard chickpeas with spinach and pancetta a type of beef dish tortilla and breads with dips  it was a feast for sure and all the dishes were just as tasty as the nextwhat really stands out about this place though is the wait staff  they are lovely and there without being intrusive  when they thought wed dropped cutlery on the floor the waitress was over with a new set within seconds  however it was unneeded until i did actually drop my knife on the floor and she was swiftly there to replace it  the price is also right paying about 13 each for wine and a really good selection of tapas between 4 people  if im in this part of town and needing dinner i will definitely be heading to Tapame again"

    "review":"This is definitely more of a caf than a restaurant as its not open later on in the evenings and they mainly serve lighter eals like soups and quichesThe first few times I walked past this place I was a bit put off by the fact that every single table seemed to be occupied by old women When a friend suggested we met for lunch there I have to say I was a bit dubious I was wrong thoughThe food was absolutely gorgeous Everything was authentic and homemade but still presented beautifully on the plate when it came and more importantly it was extremely tasty Id never really understood what people meant when they talked about food being lovingly prepared but you can really taste see and smell how much Annabelles love serving up gorgeous homecooked foodYes the windows have lace curtains draped across them and yes there were quite a few older people in there But theyve got the right idea: if I still live in Edinburgh when Im a pensioner Ill be doing exactly the same thingIve only ever been in here for a hot chocolate and cake but I loved it The cake was so nice as was the hot chocolate  Very nice wee cafe and even though its small has quite a few seats Nice people and theres always 2 or 3 different cakes to choose from each dayRestaurant is a generous label for Annabelles its really a caf and a small one at that Normally absolutely packed in the late morning  early afternoon by geriatrics I can imagine this being a perfect place for a cup of tea and a good reminisce for them Unfortunately if you are not quite at bus pass age then you may find it a bit dull for your tastes There is little atmosphere and it can be a bit uncomfortable when everyone else is a good 50 years older than youThe food is good but I honestly cannot see how they can justify the prices There are the standard scones and cakes and all you could want for afternoon tea as well as a few different sandwiches and pasties  quiches But all of them are horribly overpriced Maybe if you are a pensioner that has saved a bit of money and are happy to pay more for the better quality food which cannot be argued but seeing as Annabelles is located right in studentville it seems they are alienating a lot of their potential customers"

    "review":"This awesome new cocoa bar  cafe just opened in February According to the John Lewis website theyll be opening more in other locations but Edinburgh has the first I stopped in with my husband and we each had a fancy drinking chocolate salted caramel for me chilli chocolate for him and shared a brownie Everything was delicious Decadent rich and really enjoyable on a rainy  dreary day They have a varied cafe menu with more than just chocolatey treats but well have to try those options another time This is quite the departure from the usual cafetea room you find in department stores and Ill definitely be back YumI first tried some Hotel Chocolat products last year when a friend bought me some yummy caramel chocolate buttons Since then Ive been in love with their products although I must admit Ive only tried a few things due to the price so when I found out there was a Hotel Chocolat cafe in the John Lewis in Edinburgh I knew I had to visit The cafe is located at the back of the store on the third floor so I imagine it doesnt get a lot of passing trade and it wasnt overally busy on the afternoon we visited Now I didnt know before but all the chocolate is made on site which means the place smells delicious You can see the chocolate machine turning and the beans being ground which is a nice touch The counter is displayed with an assortment of yummy chocolate and cake like treats including croissants brownies crispy cake pastries popcorn  it all looked delicious Theres also a menu of main courses and an all day refuel menu The main options to name a few include  mac and cheese pie cocoa dogs and a power brunch  each with chocolate in the recipe  white chocolate mash anyone The all day refuel menu has some more breakfast inspired options included chocolate granola and muesli or toasts with chocolate spreads Being the chocolate lover I am I was truly spoiled for choice but we opted to split the Vegetarian Cocoa Dogs with a Cocoa Balsamic Glaze which had a beer infused dressing on the side and the Chocolate Brownie with icecream and chocolate sauce I also love my tea so I opted for a Cocoa Infused Tea which smelt and tasted delicious with delicate chocolate undertones They have a fab selection of teas coffees and hot chocolates Our teas arrived swiftly but the food did seem to take a while to arrive but was brought out by the chef which did suggest it was all made on site and had been lovingly plated up The veggie dogs were very tasty with a sweet and sticky coating that didnt immediately taste chocolately although the dressing on the side was a bit unusual for my tastes The menu stated this came in a bun which could be swapped for white choc mash but it came in what was more like a toasted ciabatta style roll which was tasty all the same The brownie was the star of the show  the perfect brownie not too cakey or fudgey and the 70 chocolate dressing really intensified the chocolate hit Its not the cheapest place and the veggie dog at 7 did seem a bit expensive but most of the other options were reasonable especially compared to the price of other Hotel Chocolat goodies Id definitely like to go back and sample more of the tasty treats but do hope they decide to open one in GlasgowGreat addition to JL and the cafe is more spacious than it first appears Also worth noting that if you cant be bothered schlepping to Frederick St for Hotel Chocolat then all your needs are met in the store within the cafe here So came here on the promise of GF griddle cakes There are GF options savoury as well as sweet and they are marked as such on the menu so kudos hereI had a salted caramel hot choc  lovely and could definitely taste the salted caramel It probably wasnt my best choice though as chocolate on chocolate is too much for meThe griddle cakes were good Like a pancake and slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside they were yum Two generous helpings of chocolate spread were provided as was a little round of cocoa nib butter The slight saltiness of the butter with cocoa through it was lovely The chocolate spreads were great too but hence the reason Id avoid my drink being chocolate when I have this dish again as it was together all too much sweetness for me and I am all over the sweet stuffSo the decor is all dark wood and chocolate tones and staff are friendly and helpful Despite it being a Saturday it was fairly quiet a good thing so more than happy to return :I crave coffee at every opportunity but I have some friends that apparently are less of a fan Sometimes I want to find somewhere meet up and drink a warm beverage but whose specialty isnt coffee I think Hotel Chocolat is a good optionIts a little bit hidden at the back of John Lewis amongst the clothes but its a nice space and you quickly forget you are in the middle of a department store They have a good range of hot chocolate varying from the usual salted caramel  type thing through to the 100 darkerthandark cocoa which I think might be less about enjoyment and more about endurance Nothing here is sickly sweet though and makes a pleasant change from the sugarladen drinks in Starbucks I like the chilli chocolate myself A coffee chocolate hybrid is available but I think its better just to stick with one or the otherThere is the odd sandwich available but this feels more like a place for a brownie  or pastry than for lunch  If you want to buy their stuff to take home and dont want to go across town to the main Hotel Chocolat store there is a well stocked shop with pretty much everything It can get busy and weekends when there might be long queues but its worth a visit if you want a break from shopping or a change from coffee"

flavor and fresh ingredients No one waiter is assigned to wait on you so you have a variety of waiters which was different for us as Americans but they manage to stay on top of things In the short time we lived there we frequented Zizzi probably a dozen timesThis is another regular of mine we eat out a lot I know its a chain and I know Ive given it a 4 but out of the main high street ones you come across its good You know youre getting something decent and it doesnt really deviate from that The one at OT is great Theres loads of tables although on busier daysnights he smallish kitchen struggles to keep up with demand so be prepared to wait and spaces for those members of the buggy brigade Theyre great with kids and are prepared for them balloons crayons etc We rocked up today a group of 14 of us with kids running around everywhere and I cant tell you how accommodating they are No evil looks or anything which tbh is quite a feat They more or less cordoned off the whole mezzanine level for us which helped hugely The menu is extensive plenty of pizzapasta options specials and meatfish dishes Like I said the quality of the food is pretty good for your high street chain Pizza bases are nice Sauces actually have flavour and the specials change often The prosecco is good in here if you like a bit of fizz Price wise youre looking at around 13 for an extremely large pizza and the pasta bowls are around the 9 mark Would recommend if youre in the shopping centreIt was my first negative experience with Zizzi I visited the Leith branch for the first and the last time The Team who is normally absolutely lovely was just miserable and incompetent on this occasionFirstly two waitresses found it extremely challenging to serve six small tables I worked in hospitality industry for years and I just know from my own experience that even a slow waitress could handle it I could not believe when I saw one of the girls working on that day curly dark hair ponytail who was explaining the bill and charges to customers sitting next to me just stopped that person halfway through and went to a different table to respond to someone elses queries They were not the only confused ones as me and my partner seeing the whole situation felt just uncomfortable Being a student I use quite often the MondayTuesday 40 NUS discount which has never been questioned before After giving my student card to the waitress and receiving a bill with 25 off on it I asked her if the usual 40 offer was available on that day Monday  Ive used it so many times at Zizzi before She just looked at me accompanied by another waitress and said that there were different discounts on different days and she didnt know which one was available at the moment She disappeared for few minutes and came back saying with a tone which me and my partner found simply arrogant that I needed to give her some s code which I have never heard about before otherwise it would be impossible for her to offer us the 40 off option I asked her for explanation on what sort of code it was and she responded Its just a code with s on it I dont know which one and went away to serve another customer Myself being totally confused and embarrassed with this situation checked the Terms  Condition online and obviously could not find the possibly nonexisting code The waitress came back saying that if I couldnt find it she would just give me that discount The same discount which 3 minutes earlier was impossible to be applied Honestly I didnt care about those 34 pounds It wasnt much difference I would pay the full price if she asked me to I felt extremely bad with the way this girl handled the situation with her attitude and the way she was speaking to me  to her customer She was simply arrogant and made me feel like I was the one to blame for the whole situation It was just embarrassing Food was not as good as usually Particularly salmon seem very oily and without flavour However arancinis were really yummyI will definitely visit Zizzi on numerous occasions in the future but there is no way I will ever come to the Ocean Terminal one againZizzis is the kind of place you know what you will get Its not going to be spectacular write home about it kind of food but it will usually be consistent Its the kind of place I would never go as a destination dinner but when grabbing a bite to eat before the cinema its a fairly reliable go toMaybe its just me but Zizzis seems to have fallen slightly out of favour especially since more restaurants have opened up at Ocean Terminal It feels like where you end up when you forgot to book Pizza Express In its defense it does offer a far more varied menu than Pizza Express and there are a lot more pasta and meat dishes We went for their garlic bread with with caramlised onions served on a rustic board Its was better than having dough balls a dish whose popularity I never quite understandThe meat calzone as a main course was a bit of a disappointment It looked OK but the filling was lacking in any particular flavour just a nondistinct tomatoy meaty thing I have a feeling that a more traditional pizza may have been a better option Ive always found the venue itself a bit of a mixed bag You can get nice views out to the water if you sit at the back However in general its in such an open space it feels very much like you are eating in the food court of a shopping centre rather than a restaurant Pizza Express upstairs manages to feel a lot warmer and intimate This is not going to be top of my list to come back to at Ocean Terminal but they often have vouchers and promotions which make it a more attractive optionThis is quite a quirky Zizzi Why Because you can get spectacular views across the Forth on a clear day Whats more if the Scottish weather is particularly feeling nice you can even sit outside and eat Ta Dah although on this occasion the second bit we did not doRight Food  That all important thing we devourThey have a menu from which you can choose 2 or 3 courses for 1095 or 1395  which I think is pretty darn goodI didnt go with the deal option as I spotted my favourite Arancini of course and a cheese dipping fondue on the main menu  We shared this between the three of us and was quite satisfactory for startersMain was ok  Seasoning or depth of flavour was missing for me  It wasnt bad but it wasnt up there  I had the pappardelle pollo fungi  a tomato sauce with mushrooms and chicken We skipped desserts but had coffee It wasnt the best as I had to add sugar and my mum didnt finish her thats saying something massive without saying anything"

    "review":"Perfect location if you appreciate simple but exquisite food that seems to be coming out of your own kitchen thanks to its authentic tastes made with fresh and healthy ingredients Open from 5:30pm until 9:30pm for dinner time and between 12 and 2:30pm for lunch this cosy but at the same time stylish bistro presents a nonpretentious atmosphere where Scottish fine cuisine is prepared for delicate palates This is the right place for who enjoys elegant ingredients as lobster served with a homey and down to earth feelPart of this restaurant includes a fantastic artisan bakery When a team member has a birthday we order a cake which is always freshly baked in the morning personalised for the recipient and delicious Plus the selection is great for the health conscious who want less sugar  our team favourites include apple and parsnip  chocolate and beetroot  carrot and ginger  Yes they might weird but honestly they are truly scrummyWhat an uncomfortable experience  We were really excited to come for dinner here So when our experience was lacking in so many areas we felt quite let down The service by the staff save the GM was abysmal Me and my young daughter were sat While we waited for my partner we were given menus I asked if we could sit in the booths as its easier for my daughter to cope in the booth yet she responded that only parties of 4  got booths I looked to my right and the 2 occupied booths both had 2 people in them Shortly after another couple stumbled in the same waitress attended them and asked them how many were in their party at which they said we arent sure 3 or maybe 4 She seemed flustered but sat them in the  booth This was really annoying to me but I just wanted to have a nice dinner so I decided to ignore it My partner showed up and we order We got our food and the waitress avoided our table like the plague Not even once did she come to see if we needed anything Totally rudeThe food was meh The chicken leg was nice the potato cake and vegetables were uninspired My daughters food totally lacked in flavour  Such a shame with such high quality ingredients to have food that didnt even compare to our Sunday roast The whole experience left us feeling upset and underwhelmed The actual place is quite nice and the music was fab If only the waitress had an attitude adjustment and the menu was revised Such a shameThis is my third and probably last visit to the Edinburgh larder I had bought vouchers for a two course lunch  coffee for myself and 7 friends so we could go out for my birthday The two stars is because the food was nice but the service was terrible actually so bad it I had to laugh They accidentally cancelled my booking on their computer and manually added it back in on the wrong day so when my friend arrived ahead of me they advised that there was no booking I had the email confirmation anyway they found us a table but then gave us the wrong menus for our lunch offer 20 minutes passed before we got a drinks order taken then only half the table was asked before the server disappeared They asked 4 times to confirm the starter order then brought out 1 soup short then had run out of the soup and offered another soup they wasnt on the menu The food took forever and we were in the restaurant an hour before we got our starters and the two course lunch took 2 hours 15 minutes They brought some potato wedges and a bottle of sparkling water to apologise for all the errors The food was nice but just too much hassle and rather put me on edge as the host than let me enjoy my birthday lunchThis is the 4th time we visited Please note that I think the place is lovely the service is super friendly and the ingredients are sourced local and where available organic However we have yet to have an outstanding meal I cant see how such an array of wonderful source of ingredients can produce just OK ish food Is it the chef Is it the quality of ingredients I dont know This visit we have been on a Living Social voucher set meal Offered was a prosecco and a choice of 2 coursed out of 3 starters  3 mains and 3 dessertsThe prosecco was a little too dry and not very pleasant to drink  happens sometimes  personal taste and not their doing of course I may have benefitted from a splash of Crme de cassis to sweeten it up a bit  We got a complimentary bread and herb  garlic butter StandardFor starter I had the wild mushroom soup and which was tasty The bread served was the same as the basket For main we both took the Rump of Lamb with stem broccoli spring onions sliced cream potato and a jus As advised the lamb was served pink The portion was adequate I personally would have loved more of the potato as that was very well prepared and just a 2 square didnt do it justice The bottom part of the broccoli was a little tough el dente The lamb was well cooked and indeed pinkish as promised taste wise however it lacked seasoning which was offset by the jus I did decided to ask for some additional jus as there just wasnt enough to mop up It wasnt the juiciest of meats but I had much worse served in other places So OK The spring onions were for some strange reason not easy to digest or chew I spent a good deal masticating but had to admit defeat The dessert was a selection of ice cream and cookies supplied by Affagato Ice Cream parlour from across the road It was again ok but it was just that tiny bit crystallised it was a bit grainy  the spoon did not slice through but was glaciered and skirting on the surface of the scoop Weird   In conclusion: again I was underwhelmed and dissapointed I so wanted to have a great experience and after giving them several opportunities the Edinburgh Larder Bistro just fails to deliver for meIve only so far been to the Edinburgh Larder Bistro once but I like the cut of its various locally sourced food itemsI was here for the first Yelp Elite event of the year so was lucky in that I got to try a variety of dishes and attempt to guess what they were from my first encounter with pigs trotters I would NEVER ever have guessed thats what they were to really delicious stovies Theres a definite creativity to the dishes here and it doesnt at all seem runofthemill and they have lots of brilliant Scottish suppliers which is always an awesome thing to support Everything is seasonally fresh and the menu changes in accordance so you know youre getting the best of whats out there in ScotlandAs a spot in the west end to pop into for a cosy relaxed meal with friends I would definitely recommend it and in fact I need to be making a booking along those lines very soon"

    "review":"I came in here when I moved into a new flat just around the corner and was hoping to find a gem of a pub where I could come every now and then with a few pals and chill The pub seems to have undergone a bit of an image change it used to be called Banter but now with its more sophisticated name I think it is trying to tap into the office worker crowd that you find on nearby Morrison Street and Lothian Road The pub attempts to look upmarket and is not really the type of place that I like to hang out in I prefer a nicer cosy pub but this really came across as tailored to an older crowd rather than a studentyounger crowdThe pub does have however a pretty impressive widescreen TV that would be pretty cool to watch the footie or rugby on but I doubt there would be any real atmosphere in there4 or 5 real ales on tap decent range of spirits amusing service plenty of seats a couple of tvs for the sport and a reasonable looking menu Apart from maybe having a problem with their air conditioning or extractor fan we were greeted with the strong smell of whatever fish was on Saturday nights menu there was little to find fault with here Could do with replacing their speakers as no point having music on if the sounds muddy Otherwise better then last time as no smell of fishWas it really 2011 when I first reviewed this pub wow that was a while ago So whats changedThe spirit selection has grown to provide a great range of whisky rum or gin some of which are rarely seen premium products The newish Three Hop and Birra Moretti have replaced the Heineken as a premium draft lagers and there is now a 4th guest ale tap so even more choice for the beerlager enthusiast Finally Symonds has replaced Strongbow an improvement on the draft cider front On the food front after taking part in the Tollcross chilli cookoff recommended outing to all those who Yelp in Edinburgh the chilli is really good Chips cooked in beef dripping  they taste great There have been one or two other menu tweaks though the classics are all still inplace and tastyThe prices are still reasonable and the bar itself is still well staffed and pleasant So all in all Lock 25 is possibly verging on a great pub to have a drink or something to eatIf I missed any changes put it down to sampling some of those spirits and the passing of timeJust off the beaten track that is Lothian road Lock 25 is a great pub It has a good sized main bar area and its decor is a mixture between a traditional pub and contemporary bar there is even a small patio which on occasion will catch the elusive Scottish sunGenerally a good pub to sit and have a chat the staff are personable and knowledgeable when it comes to the beverages on offer Stocking a fair selection of rum gin and whisky and with 3 guest ales there is normally something interesting to drink if you feel like being adventurousThe food available ranges from fresh and tasty soups leek and ginger a surprise favourite of mine light nibbles filling burgers with a range of extras normally chilli and jalapeos for me and the pub classics fish n chips steak pie are present and correct Having eaten here several times the food is both tasty and filling useful if you do decide to be adventurous  with your drinkThe prices here are reasonable not particularly cheap but this is in many ways a good thing given the proximity to both student halls and Lothian roadAll in all a good pub to have a drink and something to eat recommendedHeard good things about this pub whch is why I  went in  but I found it pretty rubbish an average beer selection and a semi decent back bar Random clientele and not the friendliest staffnothing more to sayFrom the outside Lock 25 is quite deceptive and looks like a bit of an oldman pub but inside it is spacious modern and comfortable Theres a wide selection of beverages available and a decent pub grub menu What I would say is that this place is quite expensive one round of four drinks two of which were white Russians so a wee bit dearer admittedly came to over 18 OUCH We also ordered food here Id advise not to get the nachos They were 8 and the chilli that arrived was really just watery mince with some kidney beans thrown in for good measure Boak I did not think much of the plate for the cost and wouldnt ever get it again However Lock 25 is pretty inoffensive and my drinks despite costing a fortune were nice There are some good beers on draft too Theres a wee patio section to the rear of the pub where you can soak up the incredibly rare warm Scottish weather should it ever make another appearance"

    "review":"Better than average Chinese restaurant in EdinburghThe Scottish capital and this may not be a surprise is not exactly the British capital of great Chinese food None of the Chinese places in the city even compares to something like the Red Chilli chain in Leeds Manchester or especially York But when youre in Edinburgh and have a craving for things Asian you can do worse than at The Rendezvous Restaurant The Rendezvous is a little to the south of the old town From the Sir Walter Scott Monument eg it is either a short bustram ride or a 25 minute walk down one street basically I had dinner there after a visit to the CAMRA Scottish Real Ale Festival in July of 2014 Drinkswise like most Chinese places The Rendezvous is a diaspora Think some soft drinks and a couple of fizzy lagers or overpriced mediocre wines But then you dont go to a Chinese restaurant for the drinksI had two mains and a starter: a supposedly spicy meat and vegetables soup squid with mixed vegetables and beef with mixed vegetables All of these had one thing in common: A bit more spice would not have hurt It was all pretty bland but obviously freshly prepared and perfectly edible Just a tad too dumbed down for British and European sissiesThe decor is rather elegant ie for a Chinese restaurant It is essentially one big room It was rather empty when I visited but that was an early dinner Service was okay After all this is a Chinese place so you dont expect service flourishesMy order tonight was ridiculously late I ordered at 7 and did not receive my order until after 9 The estimated delivery time was 810 and I understand places being busy but not an hour and 20 minutes late with no phone call to let you know Its that simple I was given an apology but that was it Its simply not good enough especially as I tried calling a grand total of 18 times before someone even bothered to pick up The only reason they earned two stars is because the food was still relatively warmI stumbled upon this place one night after a long commute The restaurants ambiance is great and the waitress attentive The food came out very quickly and was very authentic I ordered the pork and shredded vegetable noodle soup which was a huge portion I made it into two meals and absolutely delicious I also ordered the duck with plum sauce that was pretty good The duck had a little too much fat on it that should have been cooked off I did not expect to find such a gem in Edinburgh Will definitely return for Chinese food when I visit Edinburgh againMy friends and I ordered takeout to our hotel The food was very disappointing We ordered the Chicken Chow Mein Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice Spicy Chicken Wings and Sweet and Sour Chicken The fried rice was very bland and the shrimp tasted funny The chicken wings were fine The sweet and sour chicken however we did not enjoy at all The sauce we all agreed tasted way too sweet and had a odd flavor to it I just cant describe The batter was coming off the chicken and it was very chewy I wouldnt say this is authentic Chinese food because it certainly did not taste like it and my background is Chinese However this is my own opinion and maybe the chef just had an off day But that doesnt account for the freshness of the ingredients as clearly it was lacking Delivery came pretty fast thoughThis West End restaurant holds the honour of being Edinburghs oldest chinese restaurant Or so it claims Its over 50 years old and its become such a local favourite theyre some people whove been visiting for quite a few decades The name is a little bit dodgy but the food definitely isntThe restaurant specialises in Cantonese and Peking cuisine and theres sooooo much choice on the menu its difficult to decide what to have Like many chinese restaurants the desserts menu isnt elaborate and there is something with bananas in it this seems to be a constant in just about any chinese restaurant Ive been to One great sign in this restaurant is that there are actual Chinese people frequently eating there as we all know its most difficult to please the home crowdRendevous isnt too expensive and the food is OK so overall not too badI first went in for the buffet lunch which had a really good selection of food which was all piping hot but some of it had been out for a while and that reduced the quality a bit but with the selection on offer and the price 799 per person I cant complain The take away options are much fresher and at 45 for main dish I really like this option too the sizes are decent as wellThe first 23 times I went in I found the staff to be a bit grumpy and the decor a bit old but the good food kept me coming back especially for take away The last time I went in though all the staff were really friendly which was nice hopefully the customer care is on the up"

    "review":"The staff here really are first class so I do feel a bit bad saying this but the food on offer isnt quite as good as what you might get elsewhere and even though it isnt expensive I cannot recommend this as a place to get an easy dinnerWhere it does do well however is with its convinience  Its right on the bus stop so if youre waiting for a bus it does seem very handy and will tempt you into a saleI must admit Ive only ever been here at the end of a night out and at that point it generally does the job required of it but its nothing to write home aboutI am not talking about food here but how horrible the owner treats his employees I witnessed him abusing verbally and threatening physically one of his employees in front of the customers Wow modern slavery just around the corner never thought I could see that in my neighbourhood Please do not support this kind of disgusting behaviours Edinburgh and Tollcross are full of other chip shopsOh my The deep fried pizza here is amazing The onion one is to die for Like seriously The chips were OK The staff are friendly quite jokes infact"

    "review":"I came here with my brother during Christmas time and it just gave me butterflies to walk in The decorations were fantastic and the whole atmosphere was electric You could have been anywhere in the worldThe whole place is really cool its designed well and its easy to maneuver around The food is good too  pretty standard really I had chicken noodles in sweet chilli and my brother had chicken with leeks He loved it and so did I albeit a little bit spicy We had a bottle of red wine with our meal and my chocolate brownie was the best Ive ever tasted It all came to a grand total of 22  we nearly choked Turns out there was a 2 for 1 deal we had inadvertently signed up for Its a lovely place and Ive been back several times since and never been disappointedDisappointed with our visit the not quite the wholenine yards were lukewarm and the portions varied in size We were a large group who had booked a month in advance but they were totally unprepared for our party even though the rest of the place was pretty quiet The waiter came across quite rude at times and generally acted like he couldnt be bothered Not a complete disaster as others enjoyed their breakfasts but overall felt this could have been a more pleasurable visitThis place is amazing value for money The cocktails are delicious and the staff are very friendly and genuine Everything I have had to eat here has been good The risotto is so tasty The fish and chips are spot on The salmon I had here was awesome Great place for smokers as there is an outside area which is very pretty The whole place has high spec chic decoration and is very cleanI have nothing bad to sayGood drinks and nice selection of beer But the food has absolutely no flavor Two of us immediately reached for the salt and the others burger was as dry as toastIndigo Yard has been one of the drinking staples of the West End scene for a good while and its simple not too over the top bar formula seems to work pretty well Its a good barrestaurant to know about as its slightly hidden away down a side street which firstly makes it more exciting find because it feels like its somewhere not a lot of people know about not possible in Edinburgh plus its pretty big being on two floors so even if it is busy when you first go in youre bound to get a seat before too long There is also a good bit of outdoor seating if youre lucky enough to get a day of decent weather in ScotlandIts nice and chilled out in here so pretentious posing is at a minimum and through the week and on a Friday this gets busy with the after work crowd taking advantage of the deals on wine prosecco cocktails and beer The tall ceilings and light decor make this a comfortable place to sit and banter for a while The restaurant serves up pretty decent food all quite classic gastropub fare and there are often two for one deals on the food too so Indigo can be a good option if youre feeling thrifty having spent all your wages in the first week you got paidweve all done it havent we awkward silenceFor me the prospect of a trip to Indigo Yard and the possibility of basking in its innate coolness always induces a sense of excitement and a desire to throw on something chic Accessed via a cobbled alley a perilous journey for those venturing out in stilettos and situated between the exterior walls of adjacent buildings you would expect Indigo Yard to be one of the citys hidden gems Of course given the venues achingly cool interiors its proximity to the coveted West End and the areas multitude of young professionals Indigo Yard has established a reputation as one of the citys trendiest venues and is favoured by the citys stylish set Arranged on two floors the venues elegant architecture subtly separates the bar from the restaurant areaThe large stonefloored open space next to the entrance houses the bar and its casual patioesque tables and chairs  most of which are swiftly removed on Friday nights as the drove of young professionals arrive for their afterwork drinks  while there is more formal seating behind the bar and on the upper level for diners As night falls the dim lighting bestows the venue with an intimate atmosphere making the restaurant a great choice for romantic meals Not to be outdone by the hip decor the menu is a lesson in stylish cuisine and offers a good choice of Asianfusion dishes and traditional favourites that have been given a contemporary twist If you have never been you cant even imagine what you are missing"

    "review":"The original Vittoria restaurant they have another on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh family friendly and great service The foods good too lots of lovely pasta dishes Generous portionsSeems quite tight for space but like its sister premises on the bridge youll be surprised how big it is downstairsThis is a good place with decent Italian food Might even be the best Ive had in Edinburgh Mind you I come from a place thats fairly awash with really good Italian so its a bit of a struggle to impress me in this arena I like their pastas and they have good pizzas and nice salads And Ill admit I havent tried much else The service has always been friendlyThe best thing here has to be sitting out front on a nice summer day They have a large outside area positioned just right to get the afternoon sun and when its nice out it can be a terrific place for a glass of wine between friends Inside as has been previously noted its a bit tired though Ive seen far worseIf youre in the neighbourhood and craving Italian this would be the place Id point you toI often hear people to refer to Vittoria as one of the best Italians in Edinburgh This could be true however as I dont often go out to eat Italian food I dont have a lot to compare it to Vittoria is a family owned restaurant and I almost feel like I was reminded of this at every opportunity Which is fair enough for them to be proud of their successful family business The menu is your standard Italian of pizzas pastas and meat dishes I had a pizza which I really enjoyed freshly made and crispy with the right amount of toppings not too much and not too little My boyfriend had a calzone which I was pretty jealous of Huge in size and packed full of meat he inhaled it quite happily Me being a pansy little girl couldnt finish a whole pizza so they kindly boxed it up for me Tasted just as good the next morning for breakfast The service was actually really good with friendly waiters and prompt service I will most likely return here as it seems like a safe option for good hearty Italian foodItalian is my favourite food something about the flavour or the portion size just makes me happy I was told about this place last year by my friend Every time we met he would ask me if I had been I was beginning to think that they hired him for PRIm going to say something controversial but the food in Vittoria is better than what you get in Italy Usually the first time I venture to a new Italian place  I get Spaghetti Bolognese Because lets face it if they cant get the classics right there is no hopeThe meat was fresh the pasta wasnt overcooked and soggy and the sauce was nearly a sexual experience The staff were all really friendly too This is a family run place so it feels like your guests in their kitchen and the service was amazingly fastStop reading just goVittoria Restaurant on Leith Walk has been around since the 1970s which I think is brilliant as it makes this a bit of an Italian legend on the Leith Walkcity centre sceneThe focus here is traditional quality Italian food straight up so if you want a hearty portion of your favourite traditional pasta dish or just a taste of something that is wholeheartedly home cooking then Vittoria is your place Being family owned the feel of the restaurant is warm and welcoming and the staff are cheery friendly and ever the Italian charmers You just get that no nonsense community relaxed vibe about the place so you always feel entirely comfortable coming in for a mealTheres an extensive breakfast lunch and dinner menu so you wont be stuck for options even if youre a super fusspot when it comes to eating outThis is a great Italian eatery situated on Leith Walk which offers good wellpriced food and top service  Ive been here a few times with my friends and it always delivers the same quality of experience  The dcor inside isnt the most modern but it still feels comfortable and friendly from the moment you walk  The service is also inviting and friendly an the food seems to take no time at all to reach you from the moment you order  I went for the spaghetti carbonara the last time I was there original I know and it was probably one of the best ones Ive ever had  To top off the great service and food its all quite cheap with mains costing about 56 so you get a decent filling meal whch wont leave you out of pocket  I would certainly recomment Vittoria I just wish it wasnt so far away from where I live"

    "review":"Its a totally surprise hidden in a close Tastes so well Environment and service is perfect Absolute Thai experienceOutstanding food  probably one of the best Thai meals I have had in Edinburgh hence the 5 starsThe restaurant is located in Old Town in one of the closes just off Cockburn Street Given the location its a bit of a hidden gem but definitely worth the visit if youre after some tasty Thai foodThey have a good selection of starters main courses and chefs specials Also some fusion type dishes are featured eg Khua Khun Mae Special in the starters section which is traditional Scottish haggis with Thai style seasoning Sounds interesting but I went for the deep fried king prawns with Thai beer batter served with a homemade mango sweet sauce They were lovely  three large morsels with a tasty dipping sauce which wasnt too sweet For main course I had a duck stir fry Again absolutely delicious  tender and very tasty duck with vegetables Note that they do ask you how hot you would like your foodThe waitress was very friendly and politeDifficult to find unless you know its there This is both a blessing and curse As not many people will take your spot in this gem of a restaurant not many people will visit either The place is small and any group bigger than 6 will dominate the place Id recommend a smaller number in your dinner party 24 will be perfectAs far as Thai dishes go this has to be it I did not have to add anything to the meal to spice it up They have 5 level of hotness and luckily for me I chose a duck with level 4 Hot as that was just about right without making my eyes water too much Taste is IMO authentic as far as I can tell authentic from not Just say very spicy and pleasingly fragrant Service was impeccable very attentive and unobtrusive Id recommend this place to all Thai Luvvahs"

    "review":"This place would be perfect if it were up in the Grassmarket or on George Street Unfortunately for Newington the prices are a little excessiveI started with the fresh mussels cooked with coconut milk fresh lime and coriander Although it was tasty given that it cost almost 6 the portion size was pretty mean to say the least If there had just been a little more to it I wouldnt have minded paying this much but given that in other restaurants in the area this price could get you a main course I did feel a little robbedThe main course was a similar story: Although the grilled swordfish with the various accompaniments was delicious at 1395 I felt as though I should be in a much fancier restaurant than I wasThat said this place is always full not only when I was there having dinner but also every time I walk past If youre the kind of person who is seduced by any menu full of words like bisque and terrine etc then youll love Blonde If youre the kind of person that will happily pay these prices when its in an exclusive upmarket citycentre location that can justify these amounts then this is probably not your type of placeTo sum up although the food is tasty its the kind of place where youll have a 3course meal and still leave feeling hungryMet with other Yelpers for the UYE Christmas DinnerGiving the place has lots of 5stars I was looking forward to it however I feel a little letdown  Like Hamish S Id say the food was hit and missId did enjoy the Duck Parfait with the fig and calvados chutney and toasted brioche the Ox cheeks were lovely  so melt in the mouth but the sauce for me wasnt hitting the spot  To finish off I had the Flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel sauce which was lovely and light but full on chocolate flavour23 for three courses from a fixed menu is a pretty good deal  I opted for a sparkling water as I was driving and had a double espresso to finish off the mealThe service was spot on and friendly plus there werent long waits for the food either considering there were 10 of usKudos for a Gluten free options too as we had a GF diner at our table  Bread was substituted with oatcakes But do offer separate butter with themThe Atmosphere is casual so like Alexandria M says you could go all glam or wear jeans and just go casualGive it a shot just dont build your hopes up from all the 5star reviews  Just enjoy yourselfStopped in for dinner after fringe festing at Summerhall We were walking by and saw a restaurant full of happy people an unassuming menu and good vibes Food is quality service is friendly  a really nice place to have dinnerSunday night prime Christmas party season  This place should have been PACKED  An absolute hidden gem any time of the year but a great option at Christmas with their great value great choice and great serviceIm so grateful that the UYE Christmas dinner introduced the hubby and I to this great restaurant  We loved EVERYTHING  Comfortable setting with a clean fresh yet cosy interior  The staff were efficient relaxed and fun  The menu was fantastic  When I first asked my husband if he wanted to come along he hesitated  Most restaurants put on a stripped down Christmas menu and often replace their signature dishes for turkey and stuffing  When we checked the Blonde holiday menu we were really excited by the wide variety of options which stayed true to their regular menu  but for a great price of 2350 for 3 courses  Other restaurants should learn from Blonde  use the Christmas menu as a way to introduce diners to the best you have to offer  not as an excuse to pass off mass produced roasts at an inflated price But back to our meal  It was hard to choose but we started with the Black Pudding on a spelt salad and the spinach filo parcels  I know my hubby loves anything with Black pudding but we were both surprised by how much he loved the healthier portions of his starter  the spelt and especially the dollop of eggplant cream  Id never get him to try anything like that at home  My filo parcels were delectable  Loads of spinach inside crispy on the outside and on a bed of a light caponatalike sauce that I practically licked off the plate  A big portion of potato salad made this starter feel more like a meal  I would easily have been satisfied with just that but Im glad there was more to comeOur venison and oxcheek mains were both well cooked presented and well balanced with the side vegetables  Only a small niggle with the ox cheek  I was immersed in the soft tender meat  which didnt need a knife as it just fell apart when I was suddenly brought back to reality by a bitter blast as I bit down on a whole pink peppercorn  I use whole peppercorns in my sauces but I strain them out before returning the stock to the pan for the final thickening  Not a major issue as once I realised they were there it was easy to pick them outDessert was a very rich moist flourless chocolate cake drowned in a salted caramel sauce  This sauce was just to my taste  not super sweet with a strong caramel flavour similar to the top of a creme brulee Another plate lickingly good sauceOnly other niggle was the winebeer selection  Not many whites by the glass and the beers were all lagers light ales  I would have loved a dark or amber option especially when venison and ox were on the menuOverall a great night out with great company and a new restaurant to add to our hidden gem list  Blonde we will be backGreat food one of those places who stress on Quality and QuantityVery good restaurant Staff is very friendly atmosphere is great especially for romantic evening with your significant other and food is delicious  Id strongly recommend their Oxcheek"

    "review":"I recently rediscovered the Traverse Bar after an absence of around eight years eek Im getting old Its a place I know exists but always forget about because of the Usher Hall refurbishment the street outside has been dug up and covered in scaffolding and metal fences for what seems like an eternity Anyways I was looking for a chilled place to do a spot of writing the other night and thought Id head on down  I was pleasantly surprised It doesnt seem to have changed very much since I was last in and this is no bad thing: the decor still looks befitting of a contemporary theatres cafe bar exposed pipes wooden floor modern bar furniture the staff were friendly and the menu was full of tempting choices I ordered a portion of Traverse nachos and was suitably impressed I may even go so far as to say that theyre better than those at the Filmhouse controversial A large glass of nice red wine will only set you back 430 and if you order selected dishes between 330pm and 630pm you pay the price of the time eg at 330pm you pay 330 Its a great place to go for a drink or bite to eat and Ive promised myself to not to forget about it for another eight yearsI used to come in here quite a lot but then stopped for no definable reason The main reason I chose the Traverse Bar Cafe in the first place was to get away from the rampant fakery which is rapidly dominating the pub scene in Edinburgh and to get away from tourists This place was the antidote to all that and it decent prices and menus too though the Festival menu they forced on us was a load of balls and I hated itIn the past year I have only been back twice and I must say I am not keen on this a pie a play and a pint crap that they are promoting now This seems like a very dated disrespectful and dumb way to generate business Pushing this underclass fad onto us by tying it to art and expression is completely incongruousSome might consider the decor to be cold and unwelcoming but Ive never had a problem with the naked ceiling I think its quite original Seating is usually comfortable service is usually good and theres plenty of posters on the wall to draw your attention The noise level has never been intolerable and it is a nice place to have a conversation with people It wont be to everyones taste but it is a nice alternative if you are sick of the local pub sceneIf Id to sum up the Traverse in as few words as possible Id be inclined to say: nice wee venue And that really would sum it up Seeing a band in the Traverse bar makes for an intimate and atmospheric affair Bad staff are friendly and the support slot will most likely be a local offering which Im all for I curled up with a gin and tonic and let The Wiyos blissful Americana entertain me for the evening I love how relaxed the venue is but not so much that its a pub gig  Its just that little bit more chilled out which had me feeling perfectly at easeI dont have much experience of live music in Edinburgh but the Traverse is right up my street and very much akin to Glasgows beloved citizen theatre  Ill definitely be checking out the programme regularly"

    "review":"Tasty beers on tap cool atmosphere and music Came for lunch and stuffed myself silly  very generous portions for the cost Would definitely come back again for some more BBQ ribs fried chicken and mac n cheese YummoParadise Palms has decor that makes me feel a bit like Im at a circus when inside It is a good new addition to the area and serves the normal beers but also has a wide range of cocktails starting at 350 and theyre pretty good especially considering the prices Ive been in twice with colleagues and its been a good place to accommodate a group of about ten of us The first time we were seated in the back though and they were a bit odd and said we could only be served food if we say in the front although there were no seats left up there They have a full kitchen and now serve Ninja Buns which Ive previously tried at markets and are great Ill have to come back for food sometime but be careful that Im sitting in the right area I guessI really really really liked Paradise Palms The Man and I came here on a recent wee day out after I read about their famous Ninja Buns We were fortunate to arrive early as they really filled up for lunch which actually quite surprised me The Man got a bloody mary which properly impressed him That appreciation grew when the bartender popped by to see if he was enjoying his drink and went on to explain the bazillions of ingredients which are lovingly muddled into and strained out of the drink to give it a very unique spicy and tangy flavour For our lunch The Man got the fish finger ninja buns and I chose pulled pork I opted for the lunch special with fries and coleslaw so we could share the sidesOn the one hand I was surprised that a teeeeeny tiny pot of coleslaw was 1 but on the other hand it was proper good coleslaw with a sataylike sauce and frankly the 650 price tag for the whole meal is actually a comparatively decent deal for lunch in Edinburgh these days The bun alone is 450 It seems small but is so full of flavour that we both left entirely satisfied and with room for ice cream which is always importantIm quite desperate to try the cocktail list so will have to return to partake in thatIn addition to enjoying the food and drinks we thought the staff were brilliant They were incredibly friendly and you could tell that they all believed in their product and enjoyed what they doI had mixed feelings about the dive bar label  on the one hand its refreshing to not have the whole woodmetaltungsten light look but on the other hand it feels weird to me to create a dive bar For me a dive should happen naturally instead of be created Having said that though the setting didnt actually feel terribly contrivedI would absolutely return both for lunch and hopefully next time for cocktails tooThey have Milk of the Poppy cocktails All you GoT fans need to head over there and try it out Grab a taste of Westeros medicine and btw it is sweet Super milky deliciousness with a spice of nutmeg and sweet dreamsThe bar is a really cool place with funky decor Also its a venue during the fringe so a nice place for a show Not to mention the Ninja Buns Delicious A must try there must trySo overall a great place that perhaps its downfall is how popular it can get2 fun facts about me: I love Hawaii And I LOVE dive bars Im summery Paradise Palms is my favourite bar in the whole of Edinburgh And I like me some barsThe bar is busting full of awesome decor and Hawaiian shirts the staff are ludicrously friendly and a lot of fun plus the food is incredible and really affordable And dont even get me started on their boozy selection Five of your finest Scottish pounds will get you the best cocktail in the country: A Buckfast Daiquiri Seriously this is so many levels of so wrong its right I dont even know where to start Dont judge em till you try emIve been to a lot of birthdays and leaving dos here and weve always had a total blast When I was looking for somewhere to throw an Etsy Craft Party Paradise Palms was on the top of my wish list They were super helpful and let us rearrange the furniture to fit over 20 people in for a big ole craftathon Im really pleased to share it was a total hitThey even let me in behind the bar when I was doing a shoot for my blog Thats a lot of trust and support right there and the photos turned out beautifully  Top Tips: They have a mini record shop inside and even sell vintage Hawaiian shirts They also have loads of fun events on including Drag nights and even host a monthly Bar Boothsale which is like a Car Bootsale only with cool stuff and  A BAR    be sure to check out their Facebook page so you dont miss out on anything or youll regret itFunky interior think multicoloured fairy lights friendly but slightly quirky staff Let down by the portion sizes of the food  the buns are tiny so dont make my mistake and order the sides so you dont leave hungry"

    "review":"The Jasmine is a handily located Chinese restaurant for a quick bite to eat before a trip to the theatre the Usher Hall Traverse and Lyceum are all within a stones throw There is an air of oriental charm about the place it is smartly and cleanly decorated and the staff are efficient and professional I have eaten here a few times mostly at my sisters insistence but cant really find any discerning features everything is nice but nothing is terribly exciting I have never had a bad experience but I have never experienced anything amazing eitherI enjoyed the atmosphere it was tasteful and well done My spicy chicken with cashews was bland and tasted more like boiled chicken with a frozen dinner sauceI love the Jasmine and try to find excuses to go to gigs and plays in the area so that I can pay a visit whenever possibleOk I jest a little  but only a little My husbands family have been semiregular patrons of Jasmine for years and as soon as they took me I could see why A small family owned and run restaurant maybe twenty tables max the decor harks back to the 1980s and the Chinese restaurants of my childhood which instantly makes it feel homely They dont really try and reinvent the wheel here and so what you get is all the usual dishes prepared to a very high standard We visited on Saturday before a gig at the usher hall Im glad I called ahead to check table availability as we managed to snare the very last table for two for the rest of the evening at 1815 and there was a steady turnover of tables large and small whilst we were eatingWe decided to go for the set banquet for two for a change which came in at the amazingly reasonable price of 2080 per head For this we got: chicken  sweet corn soup prawn crackers mixed starters or duck pancakes two mains from a tasty set list of six dishes and two bowls of riceI would describe the set banquets here as classic British style Chinese food The soup was gloopy  delicious The mixed starters comprised spare ribs won tons spring rolls and a sort of California roll thing  plus dipping sauces  yummers We chose honey chilli chicken and sweet and sour pork for our mains and were impressed that neither were deep fried and both contained freshly chopped and cooked veg Tasty and not at all stodgy  which can be an issue at other Chinese placesThe service was leisurely This surprised me given how busy they were but was much appreciated given the volume of food we had orderedAnother fun thing about Jasmine is that you can peek into the kitchen on the way to the loo  amazing to see all the chefs  wok action in motionWhilst Jasmine is wheelchair accessible the loos are not being located downstairs I reckon the public cafe bar in the usher hall could be used a pit stop if these facilities are required Not much else to say here other than I love a bit of JasmineAte here before going to the theatre a couple of weeks ago Probably close to ten years since Id last been in and not a lot seems to have changed although the prices are definitely more city centre than previously and they may no longer have Tennents on draughtThe service was good and the dim sum starter was certainly also good My sizzling chicken was I felt a pound or two overpriced but roughly as tasty as expected from the blurb on the menu It was quite a while since Id been out to any Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh or anywhere else for that matter and whilst Id not rush back to the Jasmine Id say we got what we expected albeit for more money than anticipated"

    "review":"Having quite enjoyed a couple of the chains outlets in London I thought a couple of weekends before Xmas that I should try out the one in Edinburgh Whilst not exactly a mistake this turned out not to be one of my better ideas Service was slower than it should have been maybe they were a staff member down although they were as good as their word inasmuch as we were told a table would be available in 20 minutes  were seated fairly promptly when we returned from having a pint across the road I can also imagine that seating walkins rather than taking bookings all night is a bit harder to do although it may well help generate a steady level of profit Foodwise the 995 antipasti is poor value for money being simply three slices of bread tomato  mozzarella a dollop of bruschetta topping and a few slices of a couple of meats The blob of truffle may be what puts the price up but there are plenty of places in the city doing far more varied takes on the dish at keener prices The wine we chose was a decent drop but on the subject of drinks beware if using tesco vouchers as I was  when they say no drinks they mean absolutely none Whilst I can understand but still disagree that with alcohol I fail to see the point with tea  coffee Wont be back in a hurryBeen to one in England which was fan Dissatisfied by the lukewarm welcome food and service Wont returnMy husband and I were looking for a place to grab a bite after getting back from a tour of the Highlands The restaurant was nearly empty because it was pretty late and we were told to sit anywhere  It took quite a long time to get any service from the wait staff but it was well worth it  I had the insalata spinaci which was absolutely delicious and I was surprised at how well the mustard dressing tied it all together  My husband had the vesuvio pizza  The chili oil added a great taste to it but made the pizza look a little greasy  Even with the oily appearance this pizza was wonderful  The crust was done perfectly and combination of sausage chili oil peppers and basil was great  The food was wonderful at Strada even though the service was lacking which could be due to the time of dayHeerlijke pasta gegeten met zeevruchten Deze was goed van smaak en de bediening was ergvriendelijk Het restaurant is vrij groot en bestaat uit twee etagesSo I understand this is a chain It looked OK but at 9 PM on a Friday it was empty I should have continued walking Service was slooooooooow I ordered at about 20 after nine PM and the entree arrives at a few minutes after 10 PM I then hear a customer seriously griping at the manager over long waits wrong wines and wrong bills being delivered The antipasto starter was good with a few cuts of Italian hams salami and cheese The rigatoni speck I order which was supposed to be like a carbonara comes out Its a small portion a few slices of ham in it the creamy cheesey sauce lacks much flavor and the rigatoni tastes a little undercooked and chewy The place was not terrible but I would not go here againThe delightfully helpful waitress made Strada 3 star rather than 2 star  The Pizza was ok but the menu stated it was veggie friendly but it had parmesan in the pesto which isnt veggie  The lovely waitress was able to custom my pizza to suit  The cheesecake was delicious I got 25 off the food bill by joining their mailing list"

    "review":"We ate donburi and Pad Thai Very quick service food was fresh and tasty especially the Kimchi However it is still quite standard therefore only four starsRecommended if you want a nice bite before or after a Britannia visit or going to the moviesService was fast and friendly  The space was clean new and bright  Its the usual set up of benches and tablesI choose the Prawn Itame  which was a version of green thai curry  It was pretty nice and had the right kick  Kinda brothy too  It was warm tasty and filling  Peach Iced tea came to my rescue to chill my lips from the spicy tinglesill be back i want to try the pulled pork dumplings and the duck dumplings  I might also try the jasmine tea too  that will really go off my radarI like this branch staff are friendly and it saves me from going into town Edinburgh or Glasgowmy love for Wagamama runs true and deep  i know its a chain and we should all support the local indepedent places but i just love a really massive bowl of ramen noodles swimming in a savoury broth  so when one opened up only a mile away from me in Ocean Terminal i was well excited and even more so when Nikki A suggested our dinner date should be thereWe arrived at about 8pm on a tuesday night and were seated right away  the place wasnt busy obviously not everyone loves noodles as much as us but it meant we got great service and a our food arrived quickly  while having a debate over what to eat we ordered drinks and i was well pleased to see plum wine on the menu  so good  it comes as a sort of wine cocktail mixed with sparkling water that takes the super sweet edge offi ended up ordering the pork ramen with the ebi gyoza which both arrived promptly after we ordered  the gyoza was soooooooooo good crispy and packed with juicy prawns  although deep fried it still tasted light and went well with my massive bowl of pork ramen  the pork in my ramen was tender and flavourfull and the only tiny problem i could find was that the broth in my soup was not quite as hot as i would have likedso overally this new wagamama is just as good as the rest  being in ocean terminal means its not as busy as the one on lothian road as its a  bit out of the way  however the lack of people does mean this place lacks a bit of atmosphere but since im really there for a love of noodles i dont find this a problem at all  less people means more noodles for meI echo Robyn Zs sentiments: It does feels better to support independent businesses but Wagamama sure is a great pick for food at Ocean Terminal This was my first experience of the chain and it didnt disappoint I had a fresh juice to start followed by a steamed bun and raw salad and then for main the vegetable katsu curry with pankocoated sweet potato and aubergine and rice on the side  All tasty and flavoursome and fillingService was fast and friendly we had no long wait for service or food and staff were really easy to get a hold of which was refreshing I turned round and accidentally catching eyes with one of the waiters smiled No sooner was he over seeing just what he could do for us Nothing I was just smiling This made everybody laugh  Still it is better to be too attentive than not attentive enoughSolid four stars for Wagamama I dont think Ill find myself a regular but now I know what all the fuss is about and Im sure Ill be back somewhere down the lineI like Wagamama  Attentive quick service in a decent clean setting with fresh and tasty food Good selection of starters dumplings etc and then a choice of curry ramen teppanyaki donburi which you can have various ways prawn beef lamb etc  I have started going back to Wagamama due to their decent kids menu  really nice simple chicken katso with noodles or rice or ramen or yaki soba  Clean simple tastes which kids love  i might go more to the Ocean Terminal branch more if it were not for the excellent Mr Nicks Greek canteen"

    "review":"The chicken wraps here are immensely tasty 3  Lightly toasted and packed full of mouth watering spicy sauces youll be coming back for more messy finger food time and time again  Jugs of tap water are conveniently offered too and the staff seem friendly enough  As with many of the eateries in close proximity to the university campus its generally rammed at lunch times This is all expected with such a tasty lunch break on offerFood was good but mine was really  salty it was a fish and rice dish It ended up being more expensive then I expected which was a bummer since it wasnt a very nice seating  more of a cafe feeling then a nice Resturant  Feels informal but paying the same price for nicer settingTheir cuisine is very tasty No regrets headed into this restaurant I will come again if Im in the areaThe Nile Valley Cafe is a fantastic place to go for lunch and one of my favourite hang outs It is just a stones throw away from the main University campus George Square so it is a very convenient place for students to go for their lunch There is always a queue at lunch time coming out of this small cafe of students wanting to buy their lunch  always a good sign The Nile Valley Cafe offers a huge range of authentic African and ethnic dishes and there is such a wide variety available that there will be something on their menu to suit everyone They serve really delicious wraps for lunch with a whole range of fillings such as hummus falafel babaganoush and mezze as well as the more traditional fillings such as cheese salad and a selection of meats They offer a range of pates and the chicken liver pate is particularly delicious I love their falafel and salad wrap which is really reasonable at about 3 The servings in here are incredibly generous and I find that if I have a wrap from here for lunch I am not hungry the rest of the day There is a lovely seating area downstairs which is a good size where you can listen to African style music The Nile Valley Cafe offers a huge selection of nonmeat options so it is a great place for vegetarians as there is bound to be something on their menu to suit everyone As well as wraps the Nile Valley Cafe offer a selection of soups their roasted red pepper soups is truly delicious as well as a selection of main meals such as fish and meats cooked in a mouth watering marinadeBest falafel in town I discovered this place after a long time in Edinburgh and I am glad I did Their wraps are amazing tasty and cheap a perfect lunch Highly recommend the Africa wrap On my last visit I noticed they further expanded the place as well A favoriteDuring one of my many free lunch hours at the University of Edinburgh a friend and I decided to try this East African cafe by dayrestaurant by night Hailing from West Africa myself Ive hardly had the chance to try authentic cuisine from East Africa and Im sad to say Im still waiting reason being that the Nile Valley offers a great lunch time menu craftily mixing the standard student lunch salads wraps sandwiches with some Middle Eastern elements For all other falafel enthusiasts out there their wrap is phenomenal and definitely rivals Palmyras The other wraps Ive tried such as the chicken and avocado do not disappoint and the interior definitely complements the theme of the restaurant African maps art and pictures for the wandering eye Leaving ground level for the basement is quite exciting but the theme is pretty much the same save for the added darkness which makes it even cosier Students businessmen etc frequent this place at lunch time but Im still very curious to try their dinner menu"

    "review":"How lucky can a girl be This restaurant is literally next to my apartmentBefore I ever ventured in here my friend and I had always assumed its questionable location in a basement could mean two things the place was absolutely horrible and hiding itself in shame or it was a well kept secret with fantastic food Thankfully for everyone concerned it is the latter and I may be tempted to head down there in my pjs one of these daysThe food is really delicious and youll find the staples of any reputable Italian restaurant here pasta pizza as well as some really good seafood What is quite special about this place though are the desserts The owners wife just happens to be polish and I bet you dont find too many Italian restaurants with Polish puddingsThe Sicilian Restaurant is situated right across from the Playhouse but I would imagine many will not even notice it as it is overshadowed by the larger Ferris restaurant which sits next to it  It serves traditional home cooked Sicilian food with great srvice and a calm atmosphere  The waitresses are mostly Italian and are keen to cater for your every need  As with many quality restaurants the menu isnt huge but has a wide and varied selection of ingredients and dishes  I went for the bruschetta starter followed by the pasta Alfredo which was a good filling portion of penne with ham and cream  Both were delicious and everyone I was with seemed to enjoy theirs just as much  To top this off it cost less than 10 per person which was certainly great value  Id definitely recommend coming here especially as it probably loses a lot of business to the larger competing restaurants in the areaVery reasonably priced but trapped in a bygone era the Sicilian Restaurant is a proper curio The food is fine and it exudes a sort of hokey charm but I think there are many better places to go for homestyle fareOverall we said: as a trip to what restaurants used to be like the Sicilian is quite an experience But I dont think thats what they are consciously trying to achieve Their version of authentic homecooked Sicilian is far too constrained by the past for my tastes The place is interesting as a curiousity but lacks the freshness and vitality to warrant a repeat visit"

    "review":"We in our shame hit ths place twice in a weekend always after a night out on the town What ever you may think about chip shops its hard to walk by when you had a few drinks I would say give this one a go it had everything in batter First trip there I had a battered haggis and chips and the second trip was a battered cheese burger and chips Thank god I was there only for the weekend :Saviour  we were out club hopping and realized we had not had dinner and then almost made peace with the fact that we were gonna starve that night BUT we found La Campagnola It seemed like a take away place but  offers excellent food and a few tables to sit down and have a meal We had some fabulous thin crust pizzas wonderfully cooked So whenever you are out late this is the place to go to :A decent chip shop open late most nights and the staff are very efficient Ive never seen chips wrapped so quickly in my life I actually feel its 35 stars here 75 of the time I have been here Ive been happy with what Ive got but a couple of times I went in there was a bit of a funny after taste to the chips which was very slight not too noticeable which I suspect was because the oil was needing to be changed in the fryer and the chips had taken on too much of an old flavour In defence of the shop though friends I were with disagreed with me Anyway I felt this after taste two visits in a row and kind of put me off but on  subsequent visits everything was really niceIve had pizza here a couple of times and wasnt blown away by it better than generic chain places but not as good as many other Italian run places Im sticking to the chips"

    "review":"No wonder this place is always busy it really has one of the best views in the world We took two teens here to eat and they loved it The staff squeezed us in on condition that we vacated before the booking that was coming in later It is a boutique hotel Ive only eaten here and if thats anything to go by Im sure staying here would be great As South Queensferry was a small fishing village parking is really difficult Be prepared to park and walk to the restaurant Even if you dont want to eat this is a nice place to go for a drinkA pretty place for pricey drinks along the water  They have a restaurant angle too but Ive just been for afterdinner drinks The barstaff were a bit snotty when I asked for dark rum and then saw that they had my brand of choice Sailor Jerry and then was told that it wasnt really a dark rum and the girl tried to make me get something else  Thankfully Im not bullied about my booze :pExpensive and a bit out of place in Queensferry but niceI hope to return to Orroco Pier quite soon and give it an upgrade to five star but as I only ate from lunch menu four will have to suffice this time This place has a lovely atmosphere and the decor is trendy and up to date very much like the menu I suppose The fish cake my friend chose was delicious and the mushroom lasagne that I devoured was calarific with butter cheeses and other yummy ingredient  I always spy on other diners food and the burgers looked huge and very good too We dined with a child and were given an extra plate and I found the waiter very attentive but not ott Really liked this place will definitely be going back for dinnerOh dear its down graded the samphire restaurant disappointed with small portions obviously reheated mash potatoes and over use of micro herbs on a steak when we had made a point of questioning forth coming herbs on  the menu   told the herbs ran lightly through the salad  not so  it ruined my husbands steak even though we pointed this out dont like to complain no reaction was forth coming Fault of waitress Chef Us Sorry wont go backUsed to quite like the atmosphere in Orocco Pier It was a semiregular haunt for me on a visit to South Queensferry what with the nice view and warm and cosy space complete with some couches and newspapers However I hate to be a moan but on my last visit to this place on New Years Day I was charged 5 for two mugs of tea Originally they were meant to be presented to me in paper cups but I objected to the idea that Id sit in at a restaurant and get served hot drinks in paper receptacles The barman could tell I was peeved and offered to decant the cuppas into mugs Upon discovering the 5 cost I almost didnt pay for them I hate being ripped off I recognise it was New Years Day but come on guys Five quid for two teabags and milk It wasnt even table service  I had to sort out my teas at the bar GrrrSo boo to the Orocco Pier I wont be back There are plenty other lovely places in South Queensferry that can take my money insteadNot too familiar with Queensferry and after a quick Yelp consultation I chose the barrestaurant at the Orocco Pier hotel to shelter from the storms outside And what a good choice it wasWith ambient lighting polished mahogany floors and a contemporary stylish interior it makes for a very comfortable and relaxing space A large glass front and floortoceiling windows at the back giving it brilliant natural lighting Not to mention panoramic views out to the Forth and rail bridgeThe menu is a classic bistro type affair with a slight bias towards seafood Its varied and has something for everyoneThe food is fresh well cooked and tasty It certainly warrants a strong three star ratingThe extra star however was earned by the staff The service I received was some of the best I have experienced Initially one of my vegan companions ordered off the menu essentially asking for a goats cheese dish without the cheese Our waiter decided that it was not good enough and had the kitchen make up an alternative insteadInitially I ordered the prawn salad billed on the menu as Prawn salad with sun blushed tomato dressing Despite crossing my mind I failed to clarify whether or not this was essentially a Prawn Cocktail something I dont eat When it came it was essentially a Prawn Cocktail Explaining this to our server it was returned to the kitchen with many apologies and replaced with a very tasty customised dish of grilled prawns Unexpectedly we were then offered any drink of our choice on the house as further apology All of this despite being in large part my own stupid fault is certainly impressive serviceOverall its a beautiful spot for something very reasonably priced as well to eat or just have a drink and enjoy the viewsAfter hearing many great things about Orocco Pier I was anxious to visit the restaurant Stunning views aside I felt the menu was poor particularly for a seaside joint I ordered squid to start with which was just calamari with a dip it wasnt very flavoursome and the portion was far too big for a starter for one It was okFor my main I deliberated for some time between steak or the beer battered haddock I opted for the latter believing that a seaside restaurant should be able to do this dish justice Wrong The IPA beer used in the batter was all wrong it tasted like twiglets or pretzels or similar and ruined what otherwise looked like a nice bit of fish The chips had potential to be very nice but werent crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside the way most generally concede to be perfection for a chip the crushed peas were in a tiny wee square dish with the tartare sauce and were cold and tasted a bit like plastic I waited a considerable amount of time between my main reaching my table and the vinegar I requested following suitThe beer batter for me was inedible My friend who ordered the same main also couldnt eat the batterI then ordered a triple shot latte to end my meal and was disappointed further when an overly milky it was pure white latte was presented to me I had to change it for a flat white with an extra shotThe staff were nice one Canadian waitress was excellent and genuinely seemed to care about her diners My only issue with the staff was that they kept interrupting us to ask how the meal was When one waitress interrupted and asked how it was I told her that the beer batter was inedible and thats why my plate looked so full she said she would feed it back to the chef but Im sure she didnt she seemed put out that she didnt receive the standard lovely thanks that so many spit out while gagging internally and praying they can hold it all down until they manage to reach the bathroomThe view really was lovely but I dont think Id go back to Orocco Pier If they cant get fish and chips right Im not eager to try anything else they might offer up"

    "review":"Ive got into a wee routine now when I visit Edinburgh which includes visiting this CostaI like to try independent coffee stores as much as possible because its an adventure but a variety of positive factors keep me coming here For a start its super convenient Being located inside the train station but just on the periphery of the bustling gates you can grab a sit down in their seating area far away enough from the madding commuting crowdThe staff are really friendly and super efficient Youre never kept waiting long and the baristas couldnt be nicer to the customers They seem quite down to earth and genuinely chipper which is refreshing since most people in customer service succumb to the daily grind and look fed up as a consequence Not these guys  they seem very peppyAlong with being nice and keen to help they make kick ass coffee I would recommend going for the large option every time as Costas regular lattes and hot chocolates are gone in sixty seconds But paying the extra 50 pence for a mountain of hot chocolate cream and marshmallows is fine by me Well worth itEvery train journey is made better by a comforting hot beverage so what are you waiting for Get yourself in the queue and kill 20 minutes of a dismal journey with a mood saving coffee and do get the extra cream on topI love costa and its probably my fave coffee shop Really convenient when I am going on the train as I can just take it onto the train Great quality coffeeshotchocolates etc and really nice sandwhiches and toasties Love there cakes also they are very nice Would really reccomend the hot chocolate or latte as thsy are amazing Only downside is that theryre kinda overpriced and sometimes too strong Still love though and If im near I will always go in for oneWould also reccomend the babychino or chocolate babychino they are amazing The chocolate one tastes just like hot chocolate but I dont think it is and it is served with a marshmallow and the baby chino tastes like coffee  but theres no actual cofffee These are really small but good for a quick drink and are only 55pVery good coffee by Costa Coffee Nice people who make the coffee with a smile I become happy with the coffee Thanks Costa CoffeeGood old Costa whenever Im waiting for my train Ill always nip here for a takeaway hot chocolate with extra marshmallows of course My favourite thing about Costa is the fact that they use the huge marshmallows instead of the little ones that melt so quickly you wouldnt even know they were there The large ones taste amazing mixed with hot chocolate yumDue to the fact that its located in the station itll always a winner whether you want a coffee for before or after your train journeyRight I hate to admit it but I fall in love several times a day  Give me a good looking man that makes coffee and I could get in serious trouble And this morning at costa coffee in waverley station i fell hard This lovely friendly up beat australian made being up early in the morning a little bit better What about the coffee I hear you say Or your sugary chocolate twist You know the answer Its costa Its the same as it is everywhere else Good That is exactly the reason it is difficult to review any of these chains you are essentially reviewing the service at the specific branch you went to Going on that logic alone my trip here was very good And i left with another cutie added to the list of coffee making crushes All in all A totally productive morning"

    "review":"Everyone needs their local Italian restaurant  the slightly shabby rustic yet authentic place you always go whenever you want to eat out and cant be bothered with venturing anywhere new When I moved to Edinburgh 4 years ago I thought Id found that in Bar Napoli I was hugely mistakenIn a cheap and cheerful Italian youd expect the staff to be friendly and bubbly  not grumpy and rude Youd expect the red and white checked table cloths but not dirty ones still with smatterings of the previous customer at your tables food Likewise the basket of bread they give you to nibble whilst you wait ages for your food was so stale you could have smashed a window with itYes its cheap But even though a pizza in the evening only costs a fiver its a fiver Id genuinely rather spend on a McDonalds This is the only place Ive given a 1 Star rating so far on YelpIts open until the small hours and for that reason I think so many people go the 2am munchies will drive you to eat almost anything and if what I read in a local newspaper recently is to be believed thats precisely what you risk doing when you eat hereUHOHI was going to give this little midnight feast a good review until I read the papers a few weeks ago They were closed for being horrifically unhygienic  having the lowest standards ever seen by an inspector and  people were surprised nobody had died from eating here  If thats a reason not go to I dont know what isHowever if its 2am and youre desperate for food Bar Napoli is your placeas soon as it reopensSeems like Jenny L beat me to the punch here but being as we ate at Bar Napoli at the same time its not really a massive surprise to see that weve both awarded it the same number of starsIts been a long time since Ive felt like I was genuinely putting somebody out longer still since that person was a waiter The waiter in this case literally threw our cutlery at us and wouldnt give me any pepper Im not a believer that service when dining out needs to be all posh and la di dah but I want to at least be treated like Im welcome in the establishmentThe food was very meh  my Carbonara was over egged over egging the pasta is now certainly going to be a stock phrase of mine and relatively tasteless a shame for my favourite pasta dish to be so carelessly treated The girls pizza looked good although it was served in the most confusing manner possible toppings divided into quarters with them both getting two each and I get the impression that the on site dough is probably one of the best things about this placeThe price however was reasonable with four of us eating for around 20 and if youre drunkenly stumbling by youd be better spending a few quid on a pizza here than at a greasy kebab shopId be prepared to go back again and get the feeling that certain dishes there are probably spectacular Its definitely the case that better service would almost certainly add another star to the above rating on this occasion though we couldnt get out quick enoughIts pouring with rain Its 11pm Its Sunday We just wanted somewhere for a quick late night supperThe first place we came across that was still open was Bar Napoli Judging from the exterior and the dcor inside we assumed we wouldnt be treated to anything near haute cuisine  this place has a feel about it that suggests youre going to get averagetook food And the menu is superscarilyridiculously long They cant possibly prepare all those mealsWith this in mind we opted two very simple dishes  ones that ought to be very hard to get wrong And it was perfectly fine Sure the pizza was a bit bready and perhaps our pesto pasta was just a touch on the oily side but it really was a better option than the late night eateries around the corner offering kebabs Surprisingly pleasant Wouldnt think of coming here for an actual dinner though but for a very late night supper its about rightBar Napoli is a staple of all my visitors Edinburgh experience If youre looking for the best fine dining and Italian elegance then Bar Napoli may not be for you BUT if youre in the city centre and looking for a bit of little Italy with welcoming Italian hospitality a bustling open kitchen and a mountain of dishes to choose from  then this is your placeThe menu is so vast that it can be an experience in itself just choosing what you want  particularly recommended is the mussels with thick crusty bread or something completely indulgent like the carbonara And the service is warm and considerate The food is simple with some dishes being better than others but I love going for the overall atmosphere and for some good old fashioned Italian comfort food One of the great features of this spot is that it is open until the wee small hours and keeps serving until late even on a week dayI have been going to this place for the last 20yrs since I was a kitten As far as I am aware they have never been closed for any environmental reasons although according to my mum they did receive a bomb threat from one of their Italian neighboursThere are a number of mixed reviews so thought I would share mine I have only ever been at lunchtime 123pm they do a fixed price 2 courses  ice cream real for 595 and house wine for under 10 a bottle Its real food and great value recommend the spaghetti bolognaise  or pizza and sit upstairs  A great place for a leisurely lunch on a SaturdayConnie  her husband also own Ciao peep  grande cru upstairs"

    "review":"A last minute decision to go to Zizzi while staying over in EdinburghA great choiceFood was lovely  all 5 children cleared their platesThe staff were lovely  so friendlyThis restaurant is now on our will be back listZizzis is an often overlooked Italian restaurant group particularly with the dominance of this area by Pizza Express  I visited their restaurant on Fountain Quay a couple of years ago and had a very enjoyable eveningThe location is the first aspect of this restaurant that is striking  It is situated at the canal basin that marks the end of the Union Canal which links Edinburgh to Falkirk  This area was developed relatively recently and befits the fashionable image that people would now associate with the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh  The building that houses the restaurant is primarily glass in construction and this affords diners a great view of the canal basin and the moored boatsThe food is particularly good  Prices are comparable to its competitors and the quality of the food is great  I was there as part of a large group and never at one point did I feel that anything was taking too long or did I impatiently have to catch the eye of the waiting staff  The kitchen feels like part of the restaurant and if youre looking hard enough you can actually see your meal coming togetherThis is a great restaurant  Its a shame that it doesnt get more attention and I would recommend it as a great meal out along the same lines as Pizza ExpressFor all of Edinburghs numerous qualities it sorely lacks a good authentic pizza establishment Sad but very very true Saying this Zizzi in my opinion is definitely the best of whats on offer Very thin crisp bases and a wide range of gourmet styled toppings make this a place you can come and enjoy your 10 pizzaand yes you can get takeawayyes zizzi is a chain but there is nothing wrong with giving a chain restaurant a good review if they provide good service and tasty food  this is exactly what this zizzi did for eight hungry people on this past friday night after being told we couldnt order food in hyde out for reasons unknown to us as the cook was clearly making food in the kitchen we headed to the next closest option and lucky for us it was this zizzi  we we first came in the waiter that greeted us seemed a bit put out that there were eight of us for a table without reservations although they were only moderately busy with empty tables available  luckily for us the guy set a table anyway and we were shown to it with our drink orders taken by a lovely and friendly waitressi really have to compliment the waitress on her service for us  she was lovely and polite and helpful the entire time checking on us after the food arrived but not constantly being around or disappearing for long lengths of time  after such poor service at hyde out i was really pleased that this girl was so attentive and friendly well done to zizzi for hiring herthe food was also very lovely  we had an assortment of garlic breads to start my favourite being the tomato with pesto although the garlic bread with cheese was also quite tasty  i had a rustica pizza for my main with auberinge rocket olives sundried tomatoes and mushrooms which id subsituted for the peppers drizzled with pesto  it was awesome and the perfect thing to line my tummy for the drinks to come in the night ahead  i also shared a really lovely sauvigon blanc that was fruity and fresh and so enjoyable :so yes a chain restuarant but this place had good quality food and good service    its a bit of a shame that its tucked away behind cargo but this didnt seem to stop people from finding it  so well done zizzi for proving that chain restaurants can also provide a lovely and tasty mealI went here on Saturday to meeting with the only people that I would generally goto such a place with with my Parents sister brother in law and their two kids This is because if Im eating out  I want to go somewhere special preferably somewhere that does beer and also because they were paying I was pretty much ok with itFood is good Pretty wheat heavy Pizza pasta garlic bread etc  luckily Id just been out on a long ride so was feeling like I deserved it I had some weird half calzone It was good though There is a lot of spice going on in their stuff sometimes though which Im not 100 happy with Sometimes it just seems to be a bit OTT However the staff are great they dont mind kids its big enough that I dont mind the fact that there are kids and its in a central location So  basically  good for a quick lunch etc but I aint taking a date hereZizzi is one of those places you never really plan on going to Ive recently had to relocate to the Fountain Court apartments that sit across the canal from here and we decided to grab some food We had our 2 month old in tow and the short distance appealedI can honestly say that I enjoyed every minute of the Zizzi experience in the past Ive never been that fussed The pasta was super fresh and full of flavour the staff were amazingly helpful and they even had some guest Italian beers on which for a chain shows a nice commitment to choiceItll never be a world beater but dont rule out Zizzi for a decent Italian  meal"

    "review":"The St James centre is fine At one end there is a big John Lewis which is one of the biggest department stores in Edinburgh Apparently the Glasgow John Lewis is bigger but the one through here feels bigger brighter and airier There are some other shops like Next River Island Ryman Boots Sports Direct and Millies Cookies but they are a tad smaller than the flagship branches on Princes Street There is a car park attached to the centre but it is a bit more expensive than the Omni across the road The centre has 2 entrances there is one at the end of Multrees Walk which has the posh shops like Harvey Nicks and Tommy and there is one at the end of Princes Street John Lewis has its own exit but you have to go up 2 tall escalatorsa slow lift to get to the main shop floor They are actually demolishing the whole centre except John Lewis I will actually miss this place but the new development will be 5 stars when it comes outLots of different shops to explore but building is an eyesore and could do to be redeveloped in near future  great city centre location at top of Princess StreetSt James Centre does the job This mall is a nice alternative to shopping on Princes Street They have several shops for clothing shoes jewellery and my favourite barbers in Edinburgh at Razor Sharp those guys are the best They also have a nice and large John Lewis Sports Direct and several other shops that I frequent like Rymans Boots and the Post Office There is also a great tailor on site as well she is great too just down by the GreggsI know that the mall itself feels a bit small inside with cramped shops and its nothing to look at architecturally but for me it gets the job done It isnt a place that is highly impressive but it does have a pretty good selection of shops to choose from which makes a stop here worth it if you are looking for just about anything This mall is about convenience and finding what you need so you can get what you are looking for and get on with your day No nonsense Thats why I shop at St James Centre Yes it does get crowded for a portion of the afternoon but in my view this is like most shopping centres in Edinburgh and is certainly not out of the ordinary My only real gripe about this mall is the food court Or what appears to be the food court Frankly going up the escalator to see one food option and no one up there is a bit discouraging They should consider remodelling that area and adding options if they want people to eat up there In the end this mall serves its purpose without much fanfare and glory And because I dont spend endless hours shopping anyway that works just fine for meA lot of people give this place really bad press in my opinion much more than they should Dont get me wrong a lot of the time its deserved: from the outside the building is without doubt one of the ugliest things Ive ever seen in my life And it is true than the vast majority of the time you can usually find what you need on Princes Street which is only 2 minutes walk away And yes this place is definitely where all the cheaper chavvier shops hang outBut at the same time there are lot of things about this place that make me shop here sometimes Edinburgh city centre being what it is most of the shops on Princes Street are so tiny that they all have two branches spread along it You dont have to be a genius to work out that its really annoying when the HM that youre in doesnt do jewellerytightswhatever it is you need and you have to trudge half a mile along the road Especially when its snowing sleeting or raining which is about half the yearNot only are the shops in here bigger in size a lot of the bigger names that didnt manage to nab a spot on Prnces Street are in here like RepublicAlso I love John Lewis Although I feel as though Im cheating on Jenners by just saying that all of the bigger department stores along Princes Street all belong to the House of Fraser chain so invariably if one of them doesnt stock what you need then the other probably wont either The Debenhams on Princes Street is too small to be of any real use to anyone so if its a big department store you need then its defnitely worth a visit hereJust dont wear too many ayers when you do I dont know why maybe its for the benefit of the ridiculous number of baby chavs being pushed through here at any given time but the heating in thi place is always on max  not great when youre carrying loads of heavy bagsAs much as some Edinburgh residents feel slightly embarrassed about the St James Centre and its run down appearance because lets be honest by modern year 2000 onwards standards this building is no looker I still find myself in here more often than not when I need various bits and bobs as it actually has a decent range of shops that seem to cater to my retail needs just fine Its just not somewhere youd want to get stuck in for too long as the lighting or lack of is a bit depressing so it always feels slightly dingy when youre wandering aroundTo its credit however it does have some of my favourite shops for thrifty impulse clothes buying If you give Internacionale a browsing chance it often has some good wee buys to be had although admittedly not always of the best quality Theres also Republic Dorothy Perkins Accesorize Bank River Island plus other shops not of the fashion variety and of course the big John Lewis for all your department store desiresIgnoring the fact that this modern building looks like it was built during the worst of 1960s concrete mania  St James Shopping Centre is actually very good despite needing a bit of a lick of paint and a face liftIt has a much wider selection of shops than that of the Prince Mall across the road from it including a large John Lewis and various other chain stores that can otherwise be found all over the city if you just had a look However this isnt a problem as I tend to find that if I am shopping with a purpose then everything I need is here  in this select combination of shops I can find literally everything I want Yes if I just fancy a wander about Princes Street is the place to head to  but when I know what I want and where to find it it has to be St James"

    "review":"Odd to find this place unlisted on here but then as it had been closed for a good while despite it apparently being somewhere you cant go wrong with by Bite magazine a previous listing may have been culled Either way it has reopened under new management and with a bit of a facelift so it starts with a clean slate The redecoration has been well done  manages to maximise the views across The Forth to Fife The same positive note however cannot be struck for the service in the bar In mitigation I think I wandered in on possibly the first night of opening but none of the staff seemed to know whether they were serving at the bar waiting on tables stocking the bar taking dinner bill payments from customers or what Consequently the bar area became a bottleneck diners were heard to be complaining about a number of issues and getting a single pint took about ten minutes The menu though looks inviting so Ill happily revisit in the Summer and see if things have calmed down Having now revisited for the purpose of having dinner I can safely say that things in terms of service have improved  our waitress last night was very efficient My companion  I both ordered steak from the probably necessarily limited evening menu and we both felt that the serving was slightly overpriced for the size but had no complaints about the cooking itself The brioche bread  butter pudding was of ample size  moreish if not exactly a summer dessert Some work still to be done then but for the time being things seem to be adequateRecently completely refurbished and under new management  The food is pretty good and the view is amazingI really like this place   It has a great view of the water and I would totally describe this as a gastro pub  They had a delicious crab appetizer on parmesan crisps and their soup of the day was a butternut squash with parmesan  I think I died and went to heaven  It was delicious  Much of the rest of my trip was spent dreaming about their butternut squash soup  The staff is also really nice  RecommendedA splendid wee place with lovely views it hangs out over the beach at Newhaven and consistent gastropub fare Very family friendly and they pull a decent pint The soups the nachos the fish and chips and the fish pie are always winners Perfect after a stroll through Leith or along the Granton breakwaterOld Chain Pier Leith Edinburgh Started with the Cullin Skink Soup which is a cream potatoe and fish chowder of sorts and absolutely divine on this cold day in January Coupled with an amber ale and bread I couldnt be happier Also Vicky was helping me and she was soooooo nice and hospitable Excellent atmosphere and food Worth the travel or a swing by I had the Shepards Pie as my main delicious If I live here it come back this will be my main spotGreat view of the sea and sunset  The fish and chips were fantastic The mussels were really good not over cooked Ordered the pork and apple burger and that was ok Wait staff were great"

panacotta was light and delicious sweetness But dont let me forget the wonderful cozy modern yet homey atmosphere with such kind and sweet welcoming guests Not toe mention it has a little outdoor terrace in the back which would be perfect for summer dinings and warm nights This place is a must go for great British food and simple dishes with a cornucopia of flavoredLike the Terminator Ill be backStaying in Edinburgh for a weekend I was looking for a place to eat GOOD scottish meatTo be honest I am a huge red meat fan but not a regular consumer so Im very picky on quality Harrys Bar  Grill had good reviews on Yelp and it was very close to my hotel so I took my chanceI was expecting a restaurant but I arrived in a huge bar with a restaurant area All of this in the same room So it can be VERY noisyBeef on the menu does come from Scotland and it was amazing I asked for a sirloin cooked on the grill: I cant remember last time I ate such quality meat Unfortunately the sides are bad: too salty greasy That was quite of a disappointmentStill the place is really nice and the barman is talented he gives very good advice and will be able to make you a cocktail outside of the menu  if you ask nicely I found the place quite empty for a Staruday night to be honest Did not really understand whyA nice place to go out with friends mostly  because of the noiseHarrys Bar has had a muchneeded makeover brought to us by the team behind such similarly transformed locations as The Fountain and Sligh House The result is a very good restaurant Gone are the days of slightly dodgy Salsa nights and in is the nowubiquitous bare walls and filament bulbs that every restaurant and its dog goes for nowadaysI first attended for an amazing Yelp event featuring suppliers Gilmour Butchers who showed us how to butcher meat which was then cooked on Harrys Josper Grill to perfection YumMost recently I returned with Kip S to use a very welcome Itison voucher  The deal entitled us to a glass of Prosecco a main and a side each To this we added starters and a bottle of house red which Id tried at the steak event and was very good Starters wise Kip had scallops and I had pork belly Oh my goodness the pork belly was divine complete melt in the mouth stuff and Id return for that aloneFor our mains Kip had rump steak and I had whole seabass to which he added chips and I went for champ The chips were chunky and crisp and the champ was deliciously creamy Im told the steak was very good although not quite as good as the ones from Blackwoods Josper I enjoyed the seabass but not as much as I would have done a steak It was my own fault choosing a whole fish as it required much fishing out bones from every mouthful Not pleasant and it makes me wonder why restaurants bother serving it at allIt was busy for an early Saturday evening we ate at 630 but Harrys were advertising that they were showing the Rugby World Cup and there had been one of the semifinals on earlier that day so I imagine it was a little bit of a rugby crowd hangover But not drunken louts these were people dressed smartlyAll in all Ive been impressed on both occasions Ive visited and its definitely going on my list of good places to eat in the West End I expect to return before too longWell said Elizabeth H Indeed Harrys Bar and Grill is a hidden gem in the West End of Edinburgh Apparently a previous version of this bar with different management staff everything was poorly run and generally bad to visit Well theres no evidence of that at all now Harrys is a classy comfortable and welcoming place in a central location in EdinburghThe staff are excellent servers are friendly bartenders are knowledgeable and chefs produce some excellent food Prices are above my typical range so Id only visit as a particular treat but the food tastes great The menu is interesting as well not just your typical fayre that you can get anywhereWell worth checking outIn short: 99 Nailed itSo a few months back I went to a big ol yelp event here Amazing canapes divine cocktails and a ton of beer You can read about it in detail here: https:wwwyelpcoukbizyelpeliteeventthereturnofteamninjaedinburghSo of course I had to come back twiceI decided my poor girlfriend who missed out on the event deserved a date night here Naturally I had to get a repeat of the chocolate orange old fashioned for us both before we had a little explore of the rest of the cocktails Note of interest these guys do a lot of cocktails mega cheap during the week if youre into thatTo start I had the bread and dips very nice indeed and suitable light as a starter and my lady had the fishcakes We both thought they were lovely but the side salad was incredibly salty Im a man who likes a salty dressing quiet at the back but this was a little much even for me For the mains my lady had the lamb shank with celeriac mash I got a little taste of it was it was gorgeous Melt in the mouth lamb with creamy mash yum yum yum My burger was sadly a little underwhelming I felt like I was being punished for my cowardice by not ordering a steak or the chicken For desert Im struggling to remember what we both had because Im a bad elite who doesnt write his reviews soon enough after going somewhere Im pretty sure my lady got the flourless chocolate brownie on my recommendation as Id tried it at the elite event I think maybe I had the panna cotta They were both certainly excellent although I guess my desert hasnt stuck with meI came here again this weekend and was amazing to find it deserted on a Friday night Im not really sure where these guys are going wrong publicity wise because what you get here is quality stuff Tell your friends people"

    "review":"This is a nice wee pub thats perfectly situated on our walk home from work  We had been eyeing it up for a while not sure what to expect and going to other pubs instead until we recently gave it a tryThe pub has a nice bar area with committed and friendly locals and attentive staff  The bistro area leaves a bit to be desired with its canteenish looking tables and chairs but I guess that bit appeals more to families staying next door in the Braid Hills Hotel  We opted to eat our dinner at the bar and it was solid reasonably priced pub food  I got a gigantic fish and chips for something like 8 that had well cooked fish but unfortunately under cooked chips  For 8 though it was a steal considering the fish alone was too much for me to finish myself  The Man got mousakka which he thoroughly enjoyed  Ideally the bistro has extensive outdoor seating and some great views so definitely worth a visit in the summer  In the mean time Im pleased to have a perfectly positioned pub to grab a pint a dram and a bite on our way home after a long week at workBest nonchippy fish and chips Hands down I visited the Buckstone Bistro recently on a Sunday afternoon for lunch I had the fish and chips and they were the best I have ever had For reals This comes from someone who when they first arrived in Scotland only ate fish and chips and drank Guinness for an entire week I received a large portion of fish but the fish presently differently  four or five rectangular chunks of deep fried fish The fish was very tender and melted in my mouth The batter complimented the fish well It looks like Buckstone Bistro has recently been refurbished The decor was modern and included pinks purples and pewters There were many families who were also around for lunch when I visited They have a decent size patio outside Im going to make a point in coming here for lunch on a really nice day Perhaps take the bus up enjoy a sunday roast or more fish and chips and walk down the hill back into town Id recommend this place if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city core"

    "review":"An extremely busy little coffee shop with a great selection of nibbles Keep your fingers crossed for a seat when you drop in They have more seats round the side of the counter downstairs They have wifi but its very slow Well worth checking outFantastic little Portugese bakehouse  Great coffee and the pastel de natas are worth the trip aloneThis place is bigger than you might initially think as it has seating downstairs as well The Portuguese afternoon tea is a good option if youre a cake fan although the pastry on the custard tarts we had would have been better if a bit thinnerThe service is really good  the staff are all very friendly so it certainly comes across as a real asset to the neighbourhoodOn my way here today I could already taste the sweet flaky pastry and creamy custard filling of the Portuguese tart Id been longing for and I wasnt disappointed  Ive not managed to find anywhere in Edinburgh that makes these since I moved from London a few years ago Their wee shop is on Leith Walk family owned and run and has a colourful interior with deli and freshly baked products available to buy It was busy and buzzy with a mixed bag of middle aged coffee socialists a few hippies and students scattered around  There are tables available inside and outside  I sat on both during my visit as it was a typical unpredictable Edinburgh day : I ordered a flat white coffee with my tart which was actually very very good which surprised me a bit as this place is not pretentious at all A pleasant visit and I think a bit of treasured gem  I was impressed But Casa Amiga you had me at Portuguese tartGuys if you want to try the best pasteis de nata Portuguese egg tart in Edinburgh  This is the only place to go  I used to buy a lot of them from Nandos but I have stopped it as this is much much better  OK fine it is not as good as the original one ie Pastel de Belem in Lisbon but it is pretty darn good  I am a loyal fan the Portuguese egg tart here but I have to say honestly that the quality may have dropped a slight little bit from when they opened a year plus ago  However that said it is still the best egg tart you can find in Edinburgh  Besides that they also sell plenty of sweet cakes pastries and Portuguese food  Coffee here is good and strong just like how I like it  They dont really advertise their egg tarts from outside so please go in and browse around  They do finish quick  The best time to buy the egg tarts is about 8ish to 9am when it comes out fresh from the oven  Nothing beats a warm Pasteis de NataIf I want a warm pastel de Nata and I often do then I head to Casa Amiga There is lots more on offer but those little custard tarts and a decent coffee are all I usually want Friendly staff and WiFi"

    "review":"Tried this place for dinner as it was recommended by a good friend Had a browse through the menu online and thought hmm interesting why not Boy was I wrong I would not return to this place even if you paid me The idea behind it is great and unique However the quality of the meat was appalling Went for the full Mongolian feast The barbeque was a good concept All the meat was very hard and difficult to chew and yes I have tried the types of meat before and it is not meant to be THAT hard and tasteless The worst bit of the meal was the OCTOPUS I grew up in a seaside town eating seafood this was by far the worst octopus Ive had in my life It wasnt fresh at all  couldnt even bring myself to swallow it Dont bother having any dessert but if you are avoid the creme bruleeMongolian barbecue merriment abounds at Khublai Khans You play the key role in preparing your food choosing from their infamous selection of meats some of which are culled from South African safari parks so in many senses you can be the author of your own culinary misfortune Overall we said: I think that Khublai Khans is fun and different and for a large group for say a birthday where the birthday boygirl gets to sit in a throne and wear a crown it would be loads of fun but I found it to be much like the ones I went to in the States lovely but not on my general list of places I will pop into on a regular nightVisited this place on Friday for dinner the place seemed a little quiet at first but it soon got busier as the night went on  It was quite a new way of dining for me: experimentational eating  You pick the starters and desserts from the preplanned menu but the main courses are constructed by yourself  I chose Smoked Mackerel Pate and my fellow diner chose Kangaroo Haggis for starters  Both were a tasty introduction for things to come  I should warn you this place isnt for the faint hearted if youre not prepared to try new things then stay clear  I however always like to try things at least once before I reserve judgement  As say this because there is a wide range of unusual meats on offer like camel ostrich wild boar kangaroo zebra crocodile etc although when we went there was no crocodile on the menu due it only being served when they are killed for its skin  They do still have the usual meats chicken etc on offer for the less experimentalAnyway for the main course you are invited to choose from a selection of noodles or rice a variety of veg spices sauces and meatsseafood  You mount these up in a wee bowl yourself  I became quite cunning in stacking the veg round the edge to create a deeper bowl and load more food in  :P You then pass it on to a friendly chef who cooks it on a Mongolian barbecue in front of you I enjoyed this element of having fun with your food The only draw back would be is that because you are creating your own dish and own mix of food that you have no one to blame but yourself if it tastes bad  We shared Golden Syrup and Orange Pudding and Mars Bar Cheese Cake for dessert  The pudding was light and yummy but the cheese cake was just to rich and sweet for me  All in all it was a fun dining experience although I advise you not to pile all the different meats into one bowl to try them all as you then never know what you are actually eating after its been cooked  ps Take an extra layer with you too I found it a little cold in thereSo most interesting discovery of the week: Camel Is TastyIt had been a good 2 or 3 years since my last venture to Khublai Khan down at the Shore so I was glad to see some very positive changes from this already interesting eatery Firstly they are now open MonWed as opposed to only prolonged weekend evenings And second the already exotic selection of meats had been expanded further with the addition of camel baby octopus and mixed wild game rabbit venison  pheasantFor those that dont know Khublai Khan is a Mongolian restaurant in the Leith area If the Mongolian origins arent enough of a twist the way they present dinner certainly is Starters are done in an ala carte manner the customer selecting from a bunch of predetermined dishes such as Kangaroo Haggis or Wild Game Enchiladas both worth a try particularly the latterMain courses are where Khublai Khan think outside the box Upon arrival you will be seated at your table each place at which is allocated a numerical token and matching placemat Once your starter is done and dusted take your token with you to the buffetstyle table grab a bowl and get to work preparing your own dish from the multitude of ingredients sprawled before thee:1 Choose your base: rice noodles or beansprouts2 Choose your veg options include carrot peppers onions spring onions beans and many more3 Next come the herbs spices and sauces The concept here is that there are a plethora of sauce recipes on both the placemats and the wall above the buffet Follow the ingredients on the recipes to construct a tasty dish or create your own its entirely up to you Although make sure you dont add Thai Mix and Curry Powder to the same dish whoops4 Finally my favourite part: the meat This is where Khublai Khan  stands out amongst the Shore crowd The meats on offer vary from the usual chicken beef or pork to exotic seafood like calamari and shark all the way round to the downright mental such as ostrich springbok and kangarooOnce your bowl is full shuffle yourself on over to the cooks area where you leave your bowl and numerical token After that you can either get back to your seat and patiently wait or if interested stand and watch the cooks at work cooking up a storm of mixed dishes on their huge hot plateThe trick is to sample as many of these unusual dishes as possible so customers are advised to add small amounts each visit to the buffet Having been a few times now I can testify to that As Ron Burgundy would say Mmm this wild boar is good but it is fillingMongolian Feast option includes a set starter and dessert with the ALLYOUCANEAT buffet sandwiched between and comes in at about 20 The staff all seemed pretty savvy on my last visit a sociable bunch who were happy to encourage and get involved with the banter of each individual party Good craicAn absolute bargain and a complete must for the adventurous diners out there"

    "review":"For my first experience of a kebab I was suitably impressed And I wasnt even drunk This takeaway just looks like your average takeaway and even has a fruit machine That makes me chuckleAfter never having a kebab we went here one Saturday night because it always smells so good when you walk past We both had the special which was about 8 each Quite expensive But it turned out to be on of those silver dishes with pita bread filled with every type of meat imaginable Chicken lamb beef and that weird stuff they shave Im not sure what meat that is With lashings of sauce and salad it was a huge meal Neither of us finished it but it was pretty damn good  The meat was tasty and tender not the chewy tasteless crap I was expecting The menu also offers pizzas and chips too and it seems quite popular as there was a constant stream of people going in and out while we waited I would think the true test of a kebab is if it is edible when sober Therefore this place passes with flying colours"

    "review":"Just opposite Cineworld in Fountainbridge Wing Sing Inn provides a truly Chinese experience in sometimes amusing ways  Their menu for example features appetising items such Water Swamp Morning  glory in Malaysian style and Salt  Pepper Fog Leg and when we phoned to place our order they answered initially in Chinese and even when persuaded to speak English had a brusque manner that made no concession to conventional notions of customer serviceNevertheless this did not detract from our enjoyment of the food they delivered  Me and my friends steered away from the more umm unusual sounding dishes and stuck with things like Pak Choi with Mushrooms and YuHung Aubergine which were excellent and came with delightful garnishesThe many Chinese customers who frequent this restaurant bear witness to the fact that Wing Sing Inn despite its cheesy name is the real deal for authentic Asian cookingGreat Chinese restaurant sit in or takeaway They dont have things like sweetcorn chicken soup but they do serve seemingly authentic Chinese food given the number of Chinese patrons regularly seen here Give it a whirl  its like going on an exotic holiday without leaving your cityThis is a restaurant where its all about the food The menu may have a few spelling mistakes some of the food isnt what youd find on other restaurants menus and thats its appeal They still do mainstream food but hey why not try something differentThe staff are very welcoming food to table time is about 15 mins and service is good The decor isnt amazing but as I say this restaurant is all about the food Go now you wont regret itWe thought we would try a new place close by and loving Chinese food I picked this one We called ahead to make a reservation but I dont think it was necessary as when we showed up they just sat us without asking our names It is a very simple interiors and I would agree with what someone else wrote it is all about food The menu is in english but lots of what they use Id never seen before so it isnt a traditional takeaway with the normal sweet and sour etc Also make sure to ask if their is meat in the dish as the on the veggie page over half have meat in it although she did ask me if I was OK with meat and when I said no she made it vegetarian We ordered the squid with chili and I ordered an eggplant dish but found they were out of eggplant Drat So opted for a tofu one We thought we would start with two and if we were hungry order more but one main each turned out to be enough The food arrived quickly and the squid was served sizzling on a hot plate It was fantastic very well cooked and had such an amazing flavor I could have eaten two plates of that The tofu one was nice sort of like hot and sour soup It was very nice The service was good and the food even better so I will certainly go back I think they also deliver but it would be a nice place to go with a group as they have lazy susans for larger tables so you can share If you like Chinese food to sitin I would recommend this placeI havent eaten in here so I can only comment on the takeaway food Which was splendid What I do love about this place is the nearly totally incomprehensible menu Most of the time you have only a very slight idea about what youve ordered The food is almost wholly proper Chinese with a little section at the back titled western dishes  this features sweet and sour lemon chicken etc The menu includes frogs legs weird little dumpling things quite a bit of pork and a variety of other authentic dishes What adventureI went for some kind of aubergine dish to take out I had no idea what Id ordered But it was AMAZING So so tasty Will definitely be ordering from here againIll have the spare ribs followed by the and theIgnoring the obvious lack of grammar and spell check on the menus this place really rocks when youre looking for an authentic Chinese experienceIt has to be one of my favourite sit down Chinese meals in the city its authentic from the hello sir what you like today when you walk in to the bye bye sir see you later sir when you leave with a full bellyThe clientele is very Chinese which is a good sign for me and the food even more so They have the traditional chicken fried rice type food and also more authentic pig intestine goulash Needless to say I went for the former and wasnt disappointed Staff are friendly and food is tasty For this side of town its a top choice and it makes a great meal before you catch a flick at Cineworld Highly recommended"

    "review":"I rarely give bad reviews and maybe on another night Id have a different story but this was my experience:I came in on a Sunday evening The entire bar was empty and about half of the restaurant was open not very busy is my point I wanted food and I was told by the bartender that I couldnt order food and that they were slammed and the current wait was over an hour Ive never been told I simply cant order foodBizarre So Id love to give a some thoughts on the food but I cant I had the Innis  Gunn intro flightfour beers the lager original rum finish and toasted oak Depending on your tastes they were okay The lager was my favorite wasnt a fan of the others and I dont often dislike a beerThe bartender told me not to bother with the drinks menu because an entire page of drinks was not available Overall it seems like the place is disorganizedAdditionally the bar was sticky and gross and again completely emptyThe vibe was cool the space is funTake it for what its worthIm sure if youre able to get food your night will be much betterExcellent scotch eggs and haggis donuts Lamb was also excellent bangers and mash or fish pie are also good Large beer selection and a fun looking barGo here for the beer not for the food The fish and tartar sauce was really bland we were disappointed The womens toilets were nearly out of paper only one out of four stalls had paper However the server was good Overall there are much better places to eat in this cityLoved the Lamb shank It was very tender and smoothI also really enjoyed the idea to have not too many dishes and focus on the beer pairing with foodIG lover already so was happy when my Brother said we were going here before a gig Great food and drink surprised to see other Brewers ale and beer which is great The only thing I cant stomach is the price I love a pint of draught IG but 680 or thereabouts All the drinks seemed very expensive but Ive been told thats just what you pay in Edinburgh centre now The pub next to Usher Hall was day light robberyLove coming here Best place we went to in Edinburgh Their lager was straight from a fresh keg and outstanding Best lager in town by far Loved their Scottish egg Definitely recommend coming here"

    "review":"Expensive food Below average service I stopped into Frankie  Bennys for a midevening dinner and I have to say that I walked away pretty unimpressed When I came through the door no one was there to greet or seat me After about a minute of standing around like an idiot I was just about to turn around and walk out when the bartender actually came out of the bar to reluctantly seat me How nice of him to do that but somehow dont think that is how its supposed to go Anyway after sitting down I order an appetiser and a soft drink while attempting to connect to their free wifi After a few minutes of fiddling around with it I realise that they want not only my email but a password and login ID in order to get the wifi service Annoying But because I got the feeling I would be there a while I give in and do it And the wifi was slow and unresponsive Of course  The appetiser was garlic and cheese bread It was good The dinner was a calzone That was good as well The time needed to get those items Over an hour Yikes Ive got time for dinner but not 23 hours for it Just a side note: They were NOT busy Not to delve into too many details this was by far my most expensive meal while in Edinburgh And not nearly good enough service or food to justify the expense Also this place had a very corporatecookiecutter restaurant atmosphere which doesnt feel authentic Italian or New York at all Not that I actually expected that I cannot see a scenario where I would come back and eat here I certainly would not recommend Frankie  Bennys to any of my friends either In fact they would laugh at me if they knew I went hereTerrible food terrible service We ordered a burger chips and onion rings The burger was so over processed it resembled cardboard the only decent food was the chips The wait staff was slow even for European standards We had to practically tackle our waitress after 12 hour of trying to get her attention to pay our bill Last time Ill try this chain anywhereStarters ordered: Mushrooms with Garlic and Cheese Bacon Cheddar Potato SkinsMain Courses ordered: New York Calzone and Chicken Penne RomanaDesserts Ordered: Cinnamon Waffle with Blueberry Ice Cream and Hot Brownie with Brownie Ice CreamCostLunch Special: Starters 250 main courses 695  desserts 250This is an AmericanItalian restaurant comparable to an Applebees back in New York Eaters can find a selection of starters main courses and desserts It is a casual diner with friendly service our waitress was very accommodating to our needs The mushroom starter was SO GOOD like I used the garlic sauce from this for my potato skins its obsessive The Chicken Penne Romana was decent It had bacon pepperoni chicken and arugula I love all the the ingredients listed so I enjoyed this Everything else was just average The taste of the food was alright without the lunch special prices the food would be super over pricedWell if you comps this place to both American and Italian restaurants this FBs can hardly compete against them After having few pizzas and seafood it was clear that FB tries to compromise between these two kitchen styles without succeeding in neither There are definitely better pizza  pasta places out there and seafood seemed to be typical frozen stuff that food industry is pushing into home freezers In summary the food we had was nothing special that I would not be able to cook myself Regretting that we ate in this place as there were better places nearbyIts just an average restaurant The waiter was nice and polite The atmosphere is just as any other American restaurants We have a group of 6 so I can taste 6 different dishes in one time Spaghetti pomodoro was not as good as I thought The tomato sauce was very dry There isnt even sauce in the plate The flavor of it was light I wasnt very sure where the tomato flavor is Spaghetti carbonara was better But again the dress is very dry  I couldnt see what dressing was in the plate again Even if we added much cheese on top of it cant really add any flavor of it ham and mushroom pizza was the best of the day even if the scorched a little bit All other pasta taste really the same I guess the main reason is that the dressing is too dry The hamburger was not juicy Another thing was that the waiting time was sooooo long Go there if you really have time There are a lot of restaurants near there and taste almost the sameThis is one of the times I wish I could give a negative star After waiting waiting for 6 min 38 seconds yes I time it when I walk up to hostess station unmanned We sat our selves at the bar just to find out the bartender was going on break and after our drinks were done Then he pulled up a char next to us I cant brave this place is so poorly run Food was ok but I would never come her nor give it another chance"

    "review":"This place is so pretty from the outside with the wrapping windows and the warm wood tones One day I finally had time to stop in and I got a bar table and ordered the tuna It didnt say appetizer and for 9 I didnt think it would be but there it came three small medallions of tuna on some sparse but tasty pickled vegetables It was really damn good and I wanted more but decided against spending 18 for a bit of tuna  The staff were very nice  When they said they could not do a soy latte they were cool about it and I took a regular one I was there for about an hour and they didnt pressure me  Stay classy Galvin They do have wireless though they say it is spotty which is trueReally enjoyed the seafood They probably serve Edinburghs best scallops I have a few allergies and I would like to thank the German manger who handled all my questions very well Great serviceThe other evening Mason R and I went for a three course dinner before he headed off to the States for a while The ambiance was really nice and the staff were very friendly However the meal itself didnt really stand out The starter was a chicken roulade with roasted vegetables  the presentation and the vegetables were excellent but the roulade wasnt that flavourful For the main I had coley on a bed of mashed potatoes The fish was fine and the dish came together well but compared to other places I wasnt blown away The yogurt pane cotta and the cheese course were both wonderful Overall the meal was lovely especially for what we paid on a voucher However if paying full price I would have given it three stars since the service was also very slow and not that attentiveEach bite full of flavor Cant go wrong with any selection Fresh takes on your typical dishes Thoroughly enjoyed my meal start to finish Well doneA bit hard to find as the hotel is huge The food was of a very good standard  I had delicious salmon for starters a lot of salmon and a tiny pancake extremely tender lamb with average baba ghanoush and good Eton mess Would not probably recommend imam with yoghurt for starters  it was a bit hard to eat as there was very little bread The service was a little below par for a venue of this level in terms of knowledge but they made up for it in enthusiasmLive Jazz on Sundays and great set menus during the week Sunday roast was a highlight and enough beef for 2 Also where else gives you two massive Yorkshire puddings as standard Galvins was a real treat and we loved it"

    "review":"My wife and I ate here while on our honeymoon and we loved it The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and helpful and the food was terrific My wife has a serious nut allergy that extends to chickpeas and lentils which make Indian food difficult But the manager at Vinyasa went out of his way to help us find some dishes that were completely safe and delicious If you are looking for great Indian food in a well run restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere I highly recommend Vinyasathe boyfriend and i were in need of dinner while on the southside of town the other week  since we hadnt had a curry in ages Vinyasa came to mind as id read a few reviews and thought it was about time to give it a try  the restaurant is located on st marys street so in a good location for tourists especially those just across the road in the travelodge  but its clear that this place isnt just trying to attract the out of towners as the interior is very chic with friendly waiting staff and a good variation of curries on the menu  also the prices are pretty much the same as most other curry restaurants in town so clearly not been hiked up for the tourist tradewe were seated as soon as we arrived as the restaurant wasnt too busy but became busier as we ate our dinner  the menu has good variation but not the overwhelming amount of options that some other restaurants may have  we opted to skip a starter and share some poppadums with a pickle tray instead  i ordered the chicken katmandu and the boyfriend went with a chicken jalfreziour poppadums arrived quickly with the pickle tray and two cobra beers  i feel like its pretty hard to not make a good poppadum so hard to comment on these  but the pickle tray had nice spicy onions a tasty mango chutney and my boyfriend confirmed that the lime pickle was also quite goodour main dishes arrived fairly quickly attributed to the restaurant not being too busy and we soon had our chicken curries in front of us with pilau rice and a basket of garlic nan  now i like a bit of spice in my curry but not so much that i cant taste the flavour of the dish  i felt that the spice in my katmandu was judged very well as it was warming but i could also taste the coriander cinamonn and other spices in it  the pilau rice made a good accompainment and the nan bread was garlicy and soft so very good for dipping in the curry  my boyfriend seemed equally pleased with his jalfrezimy only real grip with this place is that for two main dishes a rice a nan some popppadums and two beers the bill was 40 which seems a bit steep to me  the prices on the main dishes seemed reasonable about 10 each so it must have been the side dishes that added up so quickly  but the food was quite tasty and the service friendly so its hard to really fault them  its definitely good to know that this place open especially as it will come in handy when were needing a good feed before a festival night outVinyasa is charming and elegant without being pretentious Staff is friendly But the foodthe foodoh my the foodsome of the best indian food I have hadand Ive had a lot Full marks for VinyasaGreat food and friendly service I had a vegetarian dish with garlic nannthe nann portion was big and the curry spicy and fillingMy friends and I went to Vinyasa last night and based on the otherwise great reviews it seems to have been a pretty off night for this place My food honestly was excellent However the experience of eating at Vinyasa left much to be desiredI have never experienced nuts in a tikka masala and I said as much to a lady in our group who has an allergy Shortly after receiving her meal she began to feel the effects of what we think were hidden pine nuts and had to take Benadryl and go homeThe bill was a disaster the staff completely forgot a five pound note that we paid with and they refused to give change It took 15 minutes and multiple trips up to the counter to sort out the bill The staff continuously apologised because it was a busy night the restaurant was half full Even if it had been completely booked I dont think that is an acceptable excuse for poor service and an accidental poisoningThe food while very good was ruined by a completely unacceptable dining experience and we will not returnThe good people of Vinyasa looked after us very well and couldnt have been more attentive Menu suggestions were well judged and the food was excellent Theyre relatively new but have created a lovely family run restaurant in the heart of Edinburghs Old Town I had lamb which I often do with Indian food and it was lovely  tender and full of flavour"

    "review":"One of the most beautiful and grand barscafes Ive been in Really welcoming staff as well which put you at ease despite being in such formal surroundings it was a real joy to come and have a few drinks here The cocktails themselves were surprisingly well priced as well given that they also offered free snacks of nuts and crisps etc and they were exceptionally well made Without a doubt a 5 star hotel and a 5 star barI did afternoon tea here this past weekend and it was splendid My mom and I wanted to have a big grand tea on our first trip to the UK together and figured the Waldorf Astoria would be the place to do it While the tea was pricey 27 pp I feel I did get value for my money The waitstaff at this hotel is incredibly friendly too Since we were there on Valentines Weekend there was a harp player serenading us with beautiful music while we nibbled on everything The assortment of baked goods and scones were DELICIOUS and the sandwiches were also lovely For an extra 12 my mom got a fancy glass of champagne with her tea Like I said it is expensive this is clearly a special occasion tea but I thought it was lovely and would return for a special occasion or maybe a birthday tea like I saw some other ladies doingI love afternoon tea with the love affair starting at the Top  The Savoy and the Ritz in London  Therefore its been a hard slug to find comparable experiences in Edinburgh and usually after doing some research checking menus and reviews  I dont even bother trying  One of my turnoffs is when the chefs try to get too creative with the savouries  I LIKE FINGER SANDWICHES  So when I check a menu and it lists crostini openfaced sandwiches anything warm I dont even bother anymore  So when a friend wanted to do tea we scoured the menus and the Peacock Alley came tops for a traditional offering We entered the Tea Room from the main reception and instantly felt like we were highclass  I love that this space was converted from an external courtyard and all the exterior stonework and fancy moldings are sill in tactAlthough the space was gorgeous a wee niggle was that the chairs were low and the table small with a cross bar that meant we had to sit with our legs sideways A bit awkward and uncomfortable for a marathon of tea drinking sandwich nibbling and cake devouringThe tea selection was also impressive with a large choice of premium teas which I was delighted to discover were available at no extra charge  So of course go big or go home  We both chose a fruity white tea blended by the Waldorf  As the table was so tiny we were hoping it would come in one pot and save space but no  we each got our own pot as the premium teas are loose in a pot with a brewing chamberWhen our tiered stand was elegantly placed on the table we did a quick doubletake No Scones  The server smiled  the scones are served warm and brought out once we finish the sandwiches  So where most places serve a tier of sandwiches a tier of scones and a tier of cakes we had 2 tiers of cakes and scones on their way  scoreThe sandwiches were tasty and satisfyingly traditional  Another wee niggle  not enough sandwiches  We like many diners around us couldnt finish all the sweets can be boxed up and taken home  I would have preferred 2 or 3 more sandwiches and only one tier of cakes  This is one of the things I miss about my London experiences  the sandwiches were all you can eat  with the servers refilling the tray at your request  maybe this is an option elsewhere in Edinburgh  still lookingServing warm scones was a nice touch but they were a bit dry and oddly flavoured  We had 3 mini ones  plain citrus peel and nut  I would have preferred one moist fruity scone as the plain was boring and I dont like citrus peel  Despite the little niggles  this is so far the best Afternoon Tea I have had in Edinburgh and wouldnt hesitate to come back after I try the other 2 at the top of my todo list"

    "review":"i really like cosmos despite having one let down when i went there for lunch with 3of my friends last year when the staff were not very nice and the food was not fresh however i would definitely recommend going for tea at night time as it is so much better i have been 3 times to this place and ive only had 1 bad experience with it when i went to lunch there is a huge range of foods including: roast beef  Yorkshire pudding only at night so nicerange of pizzalasagne garlic breadduck pancakesvarious currys  naan breadchicken nuggestsricesoup nachostacos sea food sushi etclots of chinnese food spring rolls beef chow mein prawn crackersand LOADS morethey also have a huge range of deserts including a brilliant chocolate fountain which had marshmallows and others sweets to dip into this is only on at night though which is one of the reasons why i recommend going then they also have chilled cakes and mini trifles as well as ice creamcones a huge vary of fruits and fortune cookiesthe staff apart from that one ocation were very helpful and came to collect your plate whenever you were done then you could go back up and get more foodaltogether i think the price is decent for the amount you can eatthe place is clean although just a little crammed and another thing i like about this place is that you can see the cooks making the food in front of yourecommend for all ages and i would give it a 45I want to start off my saying its one of the most aesthetically pleasing buffets Ive been too Service was fine pretty irrelevant since its a buffetId say no particular choices were super impressive A lot of the meats have sat out a bit it could depend on the time of day since we went late on a Monday nightMy favorite was the hibachi grill since food obviously is most fresh and is served to order Something about the high temperatures of the grill gives meats and noodles a nice char flavor the best Im a big lamb guy and the lamb is just so so Once again it was a bit dry having sat out for awhile I attached a pictureFinally dessert was probably the best The banoffee cake was unlike anything Ive ever had being from America I really enjoyed this Im sure you could find it better at a fresh bakery still good thoOverall not quite as nice as it looks Slightly pricy for dinner but lunch is a bargain I think its worth a try since this is my own personal account I attached a few photos to help you make your decisionBoy did this place surprise me I was skeptical at first to be honest as our culinary journey in Edinburgh was disappointing so far The atmosphere was nice although on a Friday night it was quite noisy and was fully booked We didnt book online because we decided to go last minute and our 45 minute wait turned into a 30 minutes which was okay I loved the variety here as they have antipasto a teppanyaki grill sushi lots of Chinese and Indian food as well as Pizzas and Pastas Everything looked freshly made and items were being refilled quite often The food was mediocre but the variety of desserts definitely made up for that They had two chocolate foundations as well as fresh cut fruit pies cakes pastries pancake station as well as creme brle and even macaroons Kinda disappointed they had such a limited ice cream selection though The staff were friendly but they seemed to be overwhelmedTheres food and a ton of it  So much choice and you can keep coming back and fill your plate up  I had the thai green chicken crispy prawns spring rolls prawn crackers crispy pork on pancakes slice of pizza slice or two of bread  All very ok  nothing wowsers but tasty and cooked  The desserts were meh  Thats that said  Synthetic cream in probably freezer cakes  Also i was quite full from all the savoury crap and unlimited juice refillsIts very busy mainly because its the easter holidays and this seems to be a cheap place to fill yourself upIts ok I guess but i know Id go to a indie over this next timeIve been to many Chinese buffets over the years but this place is of the radar it international Prices are reasonable matching your average Chinese buffet and for all you can eat it works out better value for money than youd pay for a main meal in any other edinburgh restaurantI tried booking in advance as is suggested by everyone and the waiting list was a week long luckily we just chanced out luck and just turned up and got seated straight awayTables are unfortunatly crammed in every direction just so everyone can get there fillWith such a selection of food its difficult to sample it all but everything I did try was hot fresh and bloody amazing My favourite part was the chocolate fountain dessertHonestly even if youve not booked try your luck its totally worth itFirst off this is a buffet restaurant despite any bells  whistles attached to it so that in itself should temper your expectationsWith that in mind I got exactly what I was expecting when in for lunch on Xmas Eve and have no complaints  there was plenty of food available Italian Indian Chinese Thai etc and a decent range of desserts should you still have room after two or three visits to the main dishes Soft drinks are bottomless tooThe staff arent massively evident save to initially bring you glasses and take away dirty utensils so wed a minor wait trying to attract attention so as to pay up  be advised  any noneaters will still be charged 2 to sit with you one way of avoiding folk trying it on I suppose"

    "review":"Remember when the librarian used to tell you not to eat or drink in the library Well you can at Colonnades a truly beautiful setting to enjoy afternoon tea surrounded by books The food is pretty good too although the sweet tray was a little overwhelming for me Excellent teas  I had both the lapsang souchong and the DarjeelingThis restaurant will give you the best high tea experience in your life This is not an exaggeration If you are looking for delicious tea fresh home made sandwiches amazing sweets out of this world home made scones in the most beautiful setting you can imagine you must come here The tea is the best Ive ever tested its delicious and originally made just for this restaurant The variety of teas available to choose from its also very impressive  And they allow you to choose as many teas as you would like to try with your food The sandwiches and salads were out of this world delicious Everything is made from scratch at this restaurant and you can really tell the difference from any other high tea place The sweets tray is also super unique and scrumptious The scones were light and perfectly baked The setting is a gorgeous beautifully renovated library next to the Parliament And then there is the service so outstanding Everyone is extremely attentive and friendly I had Carolina and Francisco as our servers and they made my experience very special Again this place is a must for any tea lover and discerning food critic I highly recommend  itI love going for afternoon tea but if you are looking for a seriously indulgent afternoon tea experience you need to visit Colonnades It is seriously impressive Set within the beautiful Signet library you are served up a four course afternoon tea in the most beautiful surroundings None of the tables are too close to each other and everything is beautiful  you are made to feel very special and treated to a little bit of luxury Two waiters attended to us during our visit We booked the afternoon tea online which was 2500 each it is usually 3000 and on arrival we found out that this included UNLIMITED TEA You could literally try as many different pots of tea as you like and they encourage you to do so and be creative And if you are not a a tea lover this also includes coffee and hot chocolate The first course was a small cup of onion  thyme soup I thought this sounded a little strange but wow  it was one of the best things I have ever tasted Creamy delcious and the perfect portion size The savoury stand arrived next with plenty of amazing treats to choose from Think that beetroot meringue doesnt work THINK AGAIN It was so beautiful and the small beef wellingtons were equally as tasty There was also a gorgeous savoury cheesecake topped with pesto which I could have eaten all day Again portion control was perfectThe sweet stand was what my friend and I were eagerly waiting on and we were not disappointed An clair that tastes of parma violets It happened There was a beautiful champagne jelly that was just melt in the mouth There was far too much and our waiter very kindly agreed to box up my leftover treats to I could take them home And they didnt just come in a simple box  they were boxed and placed in a lovely reusable bag making them so easy to carry around PERFECT And finally the experience was ended with a lovely lemon sorbet that cleansed the pallet and just rounded off a beautiful afternoon Offering me unlimited tea probably isnt the best thing to do I tried the Signet Blend which was beautiful and very much like a strong version of Tetley The Jasmine tea was really nice too I wanted to try more tea but I was literally full which is a pity All of the teas are served in gorgeous teapots with separate strainers which I did want to take home with me  everything was so beautiful At the surrounding tables couples were enjoying a romantic afternoon tea and families were celebrating milestone birthdays I completely understand why they chose to visit Colonnades The staff do an exceptional job and nothing is too much trouble If there was a way to give 6 stars I would immediately I cannot wait to visit Colonnades againAfternoon tea is an extravagant treat and one of my favourite indulgences so I feel very excited to say that I may have found the best one in Edinburgh Located just a stones throw away from the historic Royal Mile of Edinburgh lies the Colonnades tea room set within the beautiful Signet Library Theres a real sense of occasion when you take Afternoon Tea at Colonnades  as you walk through the hall the main room opens up before you with beautiful Corinthian columns towering above diners and old books lining the walls and galleries handwoven carpets and mirrored tables reflecting the ceiling detail It really does feel a very special and awe inspiring place for teaThe recently opened Colonnades tea salon is part of Heritage Portfolios collection of stunning venues Their afternoon tea will be served year round alongside light lunches and cakes and the menu will change seasonally depending on what is available often featuring produce grown by the team in their gardens in LeithStarting with the tea  there is a good selection on the menu with their own Signet blend too not to mention coffee and alcoholic choices too Fans of last years Pommery champagne bar will be relieved to hear there is still a huge choice of champagne and cocktails on the menu I tried a Lapsang Souchong and as the refills are free I also tried a Russian Caravan blend which smelled like a summer evening by a campfire The staff were so welcoming and friendly offering suggestions on the teas and patiently explaining every course in detailThe Colonnades afternoon tea is slightly different to many I have had They have made as much effort with the savoury course as they have the sweet Each course is treated as a full course in its own right The Savoury course arrived all on its own with three tiers yes all three tiers of beautifully presented goodies including an Aberdeen Angus mini burger on brioche bun a flaky hot cheese tart with caramelised onions fruity mini prawn cocktail with mango salsa and a Shetland Salmon tartare on oatcakesI thought it couldnt get any better after the savouries but then the sweet course arrived with another three tiers of deliciousness My favourites included an incredible mini lemon meringue tart a passion fruit clair and a mille feuille with Perthshire strawberries and grahams organic cream They really did look and taste perfect My partner is a chocolate fiend you cant leave anything in the house and expect it still to be there the next day He was head over heels in love with the Belgian chocolate and sea salted caramel tart I always order the fruity puddings but I have to agree that this little treat was something special If they were available to order Id be there waiting to collect The chocolate ganache was rich and creamy the caramel just salty enough to balance the crunchy pastry tart case  Wow"

    "review":"Havent been here for a long time However I remember the food quality being as expected I used to order the pita with chicken and olives which was not bad Not bad for a quick lunchWhile I can see that other reviews of this place have loved it and given a high number of stars to prove it I have to tell you that I am not one of them I had an awful experience here and all the five star reviews in the world really wouldnt do much to persuade me to come backThe Cafe was empty when me and my girlfriend arrived which for a sunny saturday afternoon was somewhat odd As we entered the members of staff who were clearly using the cafe as a private members club for themselves instantly threw us cold looks as though we had no right to be there and then dissapeared out of view for the next five minutes At this point my girlfriend and I wanted to leave because without saying a thing the staff had been rude beyond beliefWhen the staff did reappear they did thier best to ignore us as they took our order of what I felt to be over priced Turkish food When it did arrive it was slammed down onto the table and regrettably wasnt even very nice at all Further more the fruit smoothy that I had ordered was worryingly thick and disgusting and I took no more than a few sips before I left it We paid and left within 20 mins of entering with half our food untouchedLooking at the previous reviews I can understand that we may have just entered on a bad day where all the staff were ill or something but really it should have been better than thatDeciding to have a quick post exam snack I spotted Cafe Turquaz as it was one of the few places I havent tried on Nicolson st I eyed a tasty slab of apple pie and ordered a coffee This I admit is not especially Turkish but was nonetheless ok  Coming with squirty cream which I find a little tacky and a spoon  I swiftly lapped it up The coffee was average too and the saving grace was my lucky snag of the big comfy sofa immediately found upon entranceReading from other reviews the Turkish food sounds pretty good Ill stick with that next timeA great place for a quick cup of tea but not if your looking for a meal I grabbed the most disappointing and pathetic looking bagel of my life out of here 365 for something the size of a cheerioThe cake that followed was superb though a lovely rich chocolate slice The coffee is ok just okLocated on busy Nicholson street is this little Turkish cafeI went into Cafe Turquaz with a friend and ended up just having coffee and cake Despite what the other reviewers found the quality seemed to be fine The staff werent the chattiest but were not unpleasant either The prices were average I have yet to try their more substantial food It looked appetising howeverAdmittedly Cafe Turquaz has a hard time competing with the many established and high quality cafe and restaurants on Nicholson St It seems to be holding its ownIm giving this place a 4 star rating Firstly because its the only place in Edinburgh Ive not felt like theyve given me food poising after eating there The waitresses were lovely the food was quick and yummy  I strongly suggest the pancakes with bacon and ask for fried eggs with itinstead of bacon is a veggie so good Tip Id steer clear of their scrambled eggs They lack flavour and are watery I also has a Berry Blast Smoothie Very yummy Very fresh All in all the best place Ive eaten in Edinburgh"

    "review":"Nepalese food because of the nature of the country it comes from is wildly varied  and in some places odd and confusing However this works excellently in favour of the Yak  Yeti restaurant  because for the most part it will be like nothing you have ever eaten before  perfect for when the thought of the same old italianfrenchchinese food just doesnt do it for you any moreA unique cross over of what tastes like thai food and indian food the Yak  Yeti has an excellent menu with a range of dishes so interesting I ended up speaking at some length to our friendly waiter who was knowledgable and patient with me about what each dish tasted like When my Pokheli Methi Murgh arrived it was beautifully cooked and delicious if unpronouncableMy over all experience of Yak  Yeti was that it was a fresh new restaurant that succeds in providing something different and tasty for a mealI had never tasted Nepalese food before I dined at Yak and Yeti and I was not disappointed I had no idea what Nepalese food was before I went and Im still not too sure now as a lot of the dishes on the menu were Indian such as Chicken Korma and Vindaloo I had a fish curry which was gorgeous it was cooked in lots of spices and was full of flavour Yak and Yetis menu offer a wide range of dishes and there is an impressive veggie selection as well The food is extremely well priced with starters costing around 3 and main meals around 6 and best of all they offer a 15 student discount The decor inside the restaurant is very authentic and modern and the staff were incredibly inviting and charming Yak and Yeti also serve delicious cocktails and they do takeawaysI really couldnt fault Yak  Yeti as the food is delicious the service is friendly and quick and the general ambiance of the place makes you feel relaxed and at home  Ive been here a few times with some friends in my second year of uni and every time weve left stuffed with Nepalese food and content with the whole experience  The menu has a wide range of meat poultry and vegetarian dishes all of wich are authentic to Nepal and have their own unique blend of spices  The last time I was in I went for the lamb gurkhali khasi which is a traditional dish of the region and tasted amazing  With boiled rice a naan bread and drink the whole meal came to tenner which we all throught was great value for moneyIll hopefully come here again soon as its service food and atmosphere are all faultlessWhat a surprisingly tasteful and affordable delight of a restaurant I am thoroughly impressed with the set meals for one person I ordered a thali plate and it was so full of so much food for about 5 Unbelievable I will definitely go back to this place it is worth checking out for sure and its easy on your wallet It doesnt taste like you are paying a low price for the food either The tastes were robust high quality and non greasy They offer these Nepalese dumplings that they can steam for you instead of fry Highly recommend that dish I also like their soups and their friendliness This is one of my favorite restaurants in EdinburghWe actually ended up going to this restaurant because all the other restaurants were closed We were hoping to find some Scottish food I was so glad they were open The food was simply fantastic and the service was 5 star I think the owners name is Monty We talked to him quite a bit while we ate It was absolutely incredible If you are in Edinburgh dont miss it There were a total of 9 of us including one 6 year old child I live in San Diego and really miss this restaurant I wish there was one hereGreat IndianNepalese food The staff was very friendly knowledgeable and fast when my wife and I popped in the other evening They offer a wide variety of Indian cuisine with some Gurkha dishes as well Complementary with the meal they brought us a variety of sauces to dip a dried bread chip into not sure what it is actually called Very nice while we waited and tasty Yak  Yeti has some cool choices of local beers I tried the Gurkha and was very happy with it If you like really spicy make sure to emphasize it We will be going back"

    "review":"If like me youve endured many a wintry day strolling around the sites of Edinburgh and find yourself yearning for scrumptious finger food ample amounts of cerveza and the inviting warmth of a rustic candlelit environment you can do no better than to venture up the quaintly cobbled Cockburn Street to find Viva la Mexico Although the notion of authentic Mexican cuisine in the middle of the Scottish Capital soundswell a little farfetched wait until youve dipped some crispy calamares into a spicy chipotle mayonnaise dip and lapped it up with a chilled Modelo Especial then the idea of authentic Mexican food in Scotland wont sound so outlandish With some truly cracking enchiladas and equally tempting sizzling fajitas Viva La Mexico is a sure bet for a flavour packed evening with friends and family alike Unless your planning on dining with a large group 6 and above in which case I would advise booking via phone its usually possible to get a table on an adhoc basis An average meal Food and drink is around 20 per head so it shouldnt be too hard to rally some amigos huddle around a table and savor the delights of some Mexican food that packs a flavoursome punch Oh and make sure you order extra refried beans a trusty accompaniment for any wholesome Mexican dishLocated on the very interesting Cockburn Street just next to the Royal Mile this Mexican Restaurant was a pleasant and refreshing surprise It offers a very good lunch deal offering Sopa del Diaa type of bean soup with a main of  Burritos or Chimichanga or Tacos Del Pollo or Enchiladas with a choice of chickenbeefpork or vegetable fillings all for 550pounds And the portions are very satisfying as wellIts a very colourful shop with tall walls covered in mostly Zapatistas photographs In the evenings the downstairs room is available which is a little more cramped but a little more romantic if you get a window seatoverlooking New Town Book before hand for a Saturday night if you are a group The staff are super friendly tooAside from the refried beans and rice our food tasted pretty bad one dish even tasted exactly what I imagine a wet towel would taste like GAG We were seated in the basement and the service was pretty slow not sure if they forgot us a few times I ended up feeling quite sick from whatever I did intake  was not a fun experience at allThe table legs were uneven and the table surface was sticky  not a good look guys not at allArriba ArribaMexico has landed in Edinburgh with Viva Mexico one of the best Tex Mex places I have had the pleasure of going to The staff are great the dcor brings all the vibrancy I expect when I think of Mexico and the food is amazingDuring the day you can choose from their lunch menu which is surprisingly generous offering the Sopa del Dia soup of the day with a choice of chicken  beef  pork  veggie burritios tacos enchiladas and chimichanga The burritos are awesome definitely go for them but the other stuff is really good as well Moving onto the evening it is a good idea to book a table as it fills up quickly I was always a bit sceptical of Mexican restaurants as I thought I could just make it myself but Ay Yay Yay how wrong I was Well I can make Mexican food but just nowhere near as good as these guys The camerones king prawns in chipotle sauce are de puta madre lets translate that as absolutely spiffing darling and the fajitas are pretty damn fine as well The atmosphere is really good here it is always vibrant and the staff are really friendly It is pretty good value as well for the quality of the food on offerIf all Mexican food is as bueno as this then definitely Viva MexicoMe gusta mucho Viva Mexico Es increble y me hace om nom nomMy debatable Spanishskills aside Viva Mexico ticks all my boxesTasty authentic Mexican food Like quesidillas to start mmm gooey spicy cheesy meaty goodness And a burrito for main mmm meaty spicy meaty cheesy goodness and some tasty vino roso to keep my tastebuds cool Friendly staff efficient and take the time to care but also leave you alone enough to enjoy the meal Fun but stylish decor inside bringing some mexican sunshine to a cold and windy EdinburghCentral easytofind 5 minutes from North Bridge and Waverly Train Station yet not overly popular Ive been here for lunch with family evening datewithgirlfriends and itd be great as a premovie date dinnerMexican food is hard to come by in Scotland I only know of a few restaurants in both the big cities but Viva Mexico do it and they do it wellThis is the only place to get mexican food in Edinburgh as far as Im concerned Yes the place is decorated like a Tijuana gift shop but everything was so delicious Im willing to overlook that  Theres a pretty standard selection of yum yums: nachos tostadas enchiladas chimichangas etc  The bar also serves up a delicious frozen strawberry margarita in addition to several mexican beers  If youre looking for tacos that consist of pita bread filled with rice curse you Chiquito then this may not be the mexican food for you  But if you hail from West Coast and would shoot a baby penguin for some decent guacamole youre in luck"

    "review":"Timberyard is innocuous from the outside easily passed unnoticed at the bottom of Lady Lawson Street but as soon as you open the huge glass doors the stylish interior and vibrant atmosphere make for a very warm welcomeInside is a very chic stripped back rusticindustrialwarehouse environment With the bar in the middle of the main dining room and a large blackboard on the back wall with rotational beers and cocktails written on it The open plan dining area is huge tables are well spaced offer plenty privacy but also retain an intimate feel There is also a tranquil courtyard a perfect space to enjoy the sun with a drink in handThe food menu is meticulously assembled with a dedication to local seasonal produce and sustainability they even filter and bottle their own water But more than that it has a very nordic feel think Nomaish with plenty foraging pickling smoking and ingenious ingredient matching but also combining classic French technique with a nod to traditional Scottish dishes as well The food most definitely delivers the promises it makes on paper Timberyard is all about flavour flavour and flavour Everything you will eat will be a taste sensation I promise In addition to the quality of the food the presentation is beautiful Each dish a work of art The drinks options are of the same high standard offering a very comprehensive wine list creative and unique cocktails and a good selection of beers Service is faultlessly smooth Staff are very friendly striking a perfect balance by being attentive without being intrusiveI think Timberyard offers pretty good value for money Some of the larger dishes arent inexpensive but the menu is made up of bites and small plates as well offering a unique sort of tapasFrenchNordic fusion Complimentary fresh bread complete with whipped crowdie butter celery salt and juniper infused pepper and afters of mini lemon meringue biscuit tuiles and white chocolate cylinders also adding to an already spectacular first impressionIn summary Timberyard is an awesome place to enjoy fine dining in a relaxed casual environment with a great buzz and without fine dining prices mostlyNow this place really floats my boat Before I start its a belter The restaurant itself is stunning  reclaimed wood dominating the tables small number of art pieces and would you believe I even noticed the radiators Yes the radiators We opted for the 6 course tasting menu and paired wines we couldnt quite bring ourselves to do the 8 course menu All food is seasonal and local so it is constantly changing We had raw venison crab duck trout lamb or halibut for the fifth round so we had one of each and topped off with a refreshing sorbet and buttermilk biscuit The wine pairings were clever including non fermented sherries through to cider through to small batch hand crafted reds and whites We couldnt fault a single thing  Now finally the service  we must have had 6 servers possibly more throughout the evening and every single one as courteous knowledgeable friendly as the next one In truth this made the evening they have it down to an absolute tea Now theres always a bit of a niggle with any restaurant and this is no exception so I want to ensure this review is balanced and not completely gushy  the gripe at this restaurant  was the paper napkin Yes beautiful antique cutlery sat on top of a paper napkin Other than that simply spectacular we will be backWent for a fancy meal for a special occasion because it had been recommended by someone who had a Christmas work night there Was kinda disappointed was although the ambiance and barn like decor was unique  it was very expensive we got the tasting menu that you cant really work out what the dishes will be because all ingredients are listed out   much like the Kitchen and Gardeners Cottage and portions were small so we left still hungry  Good for someone with adventurous tastesnot for the faint of heart  as there were unusual cocktails combinations including things like charcoal cocktails pigeon and heart  Left with something more to be desired but good for that rare occasionMy first foray into foams of the food kind Interesting and unusual flavours but totally mouthwatering to delicious Love the old timber yard warehouse transformation into an uber cool crowd restaurant that isnt intimidating but welcoming in nature and oozing with wooden wisdom and style The small entrees allowed us to choose a few to get a real sense and taste of the place I had the Pea bite and the Halibut for main but it was the dessert plate that took my breath and tastebuds away Strawberries in many different ways ala a roll upa foama meringue a sweet haven of delight You dont go here hungry but ready to experience the chefs offerings and the future of Edinburghs fine dining spotsAmazing atmosphere kind people and the food yummy Had the mackerel which was beautiful as well Great whiskeys tooI want to give 32 stars for them mostly based in my vegetarian experience there The meat eaters were way happier with their dishes so I guess it was not a wise idea going there to try their vegetarian 4 course menuThe most disappointing dish was the one I had highest expectations it had caramelised   onions some root vegetables I cant remember now and one of my favourite ingredients: black truffle And for mine and everyone else surprise this dish was just lacking so much flavour that we could believe the shaved black truffles tasted like dried potatoes and that really shocked us since truffles are difficult to disguise in a dishService was good but quite slow as we were catching up with my sisterinlaw that havent seen in a while we didnt really bother about the long waiting time for each dishWine list was quite small and expensive The best part of my dinner was the strawberry dessert Really yummyBe aware that you will need constant explanation about the dishes we didnt know more than half the ingredients listed there the staff was helpful though"

    "review":"They arent the only Korean restaurant like they claim Shilla is a much better alternative but Im not sure if they offer takeawayAnyway Korean food is lovely if you havent tried it alot fresher tasting than Chinese or Japanese food a nice moist flavor which sounds off but youll know when you tasteThis place is ok if you are in the area but a little bit expensive for what youre actually gettingThere is now more than one place to acquire Korean food in Edinburgh But not many Ong Gie is one of themA fairly new addition to the Southside area Ong Gie has some competition considering the number of takeaways and restaurants nearby for its mostly student clientele Near to George Square and the main library many a student will pass this takeaway on their way home from evening study Being something a bit different gives Ong Gie somewhat of an advantageNot bad for a lazy takeaway especially if you want something a bit different but with room for improvementIve tried takeaway from here a couple of times and its always been okay There is a reasonable menu with quite a variety to choose from but once it arrives its not always as exciting as the menu make it out to be Service can be a little slow but on the whole the staff are friendlyThis gives Ong GieI accept that its had very favourable reviews but it is infact one of the poorest take aways Ive ever hadMy girlfirend ordered the chicken curry which consisted of chicken cubes in a watery sauce that tasted like those artiificial curry sachets you get with curry and chipsI ordered deep fried chicken in a soy glaze with a hint of chilli but there was no flavour at all apart from oil salt and gloopy onions The chicken itself was very small chicken drumsticks with no meat on themso overall it felt like what we ordered wasnt what we got and what we did get wasnt good qualityClaiming to be the only Korean restaurant in Edinburgh Ong Gie is situated very close to the universities central libraryThe food here is ecclectic and suprisingly good I really wasnt sure what to expect with Korean food having never had it before but it is tasty and the menu also has a nice balance of vegetarian and meat dishes to keep everybody happy The prices are also reasonable but getting your food either delivered or for you to pick up is a tad on the slow sideOther than that Ong Gie isnt a bad place to go to  and being the only Kerean restaurant in Edinburgh it certainly has a unique selling pointBig place that will accomodate a group  Has good service  Not my favourite Korean place but good optionOng Gie is a decent Korean takeaway situated near Buccleuch Place and offers friendly service and good food although the prices arent really that cheap  I came here with some mates in December last year as an interesting alternative to the usual Indian or Chinese takeaways and we certainly werent disappointed by the quality of the food  Korean food is similar to Chinese and Japanese cuisine yet there are more things like kebabs and dumplings  I went for the barbecued beef which was served in a delcious mild sauce with fried riceThe food didnt take long to be prepared and was filling as well as tasty  It did cost about 10 per person though which isnt cheap considering it was just a takeawayOng Gie is an excellent Korean eatery but it comes at a price to match"

    "review":"After reading a great review of this place in ion magazine I decided to check it out and was not disappointed Me and my girlfriend had the mussels to start with which were amazing We then followed it off with 2 huge sirloin steaks and some of their homemade chips After that we could not manage desserts We had a great time the staff are attentive and polite and I could not recommend this place highly enoughMy husband and I and our travel mates spent our last evening in Edinburgh at Blackwoods My only regret is that we didnt find it sooner We started our visit by meeting the young german chef and seeing the Jasper a coal fueled oven Then a starter of mussels which were so creamy and tasty we ate a giant pile of them Dinner was no disappointment I had the lamb chops which were seasoned to perfection and then slowly smoked in the Jasper It is worth the trip just to taste the tender smoked meats from the Jasper Although I wasnt offered a taste from either my husband who had the ribeye or our travel companion who had the pork I was assured that it was pure smoked heaven I was given a taste of the chefs special salmon ravioli served with fresh spinach and roasted cherry tomatos It was as wonderful to taste as it looked We were all pretty full but the handmade deserts we saw in the kitchen were impossible to resist The lemon tart was lite and tasty Both tart in flavor and sweet at the same time I had the benofee pie Its crunchy graham cracker crust banana layer and cream were to die for We all left the restaurant full and a little sad it was our last evening in Edinburgh The service is friendly and attentive The price is within reason for such a wonderful feast  Should we ever pass through Edinburgh again it is a must doThe Edinburgh Voucher Royals went out for a date night this time to Blackwoods Bar  Grill  They boast about having a out of 2 in Edinburgh Josper Grill This is like cooking an charcoal barbecue indoors We were previously unaware that this place existed and after finding a dining voucher online for a steak main  sauce and sides On arrival they were very pleasant an courteous Took our coats and bags We were asked to choose which table we wanted The place is small 20 covers max The wall were covered in dark brown textured wallpaper The lighting was minimal but well placed It oozes class and sophistication We were duly introduced to the menu the specials and  the missing   replacement dishes The wine list was small but well sourced I also liked the fact that they had 9 wines by the glass 3 red 3 white 2 rose 1 prosecco The bread was served with oil  vinegar dip and 3 kinds of butter one of which was a very tasty hazelnut butter after ordering we got served an amuse bouche of josper grilled fillet steak  celeriac foam That Was DeliciousWe decided to share a starter We selected the Lobster Tarragon Ravioli with Thermidor sauce Very tasty and outstanding though possibly a little thick on the edges  It went well with their prosecco For main we had the same: RibEye steak MediumRare with Green Pepper  12yo Scotch sauce Skinny Fries and a side of Bone Marrowwe asked for mayonnaise however they didnt have that so they suggested to use a Bearnaise sauce for our fries  interesting yet tasty alternativeMy steak was cooked slightly rarer than I would have liked but it was good Yes good  not wow outstanding or fantastic Good Definitely in my top 3 for a good steak Missing was the charcoal flavour like we had on the amuse bouche fillet it was possibly too subtle same issue with the sauce again I like my flavours a little bolder and this was again slightly too delicate I am sure the chefs are very accomplished as you could tell by the way all was presented and prepared We had some espressos afterwards It took a while for our bill to be presented and in turn trying to pay  they did apologise for that In all this was a very successful datenightWhat a delightful dinner experience We had found some excellent Groupon vouchers for this place Its very inviting and comfortable definitely one of the nicest places I have been to in Edinburgh Its not very big so always good to make reservations ahead of timeWe started with the breadbutter with olives They marinate their olives and they are really tasty Wee one couldnt get enough of them That was followed by a wee haggis bomb with mango chutney This was a pleasant and welcome surprise All the food is sourced locally direct from farms when possible which is very impressive We both got sirloin steaks which indeed tasted barbecued they had a side of barbecued pumpkin All very tasty cooked to perfection Getting this barbecued  food is a very big treat since it is practically impossible to get anything freshly bbqed in this town The manager was very friendly and offered to have made a special childrens dinner for our wee one She got some breaded chicken goujons with some divine mashed potatoes and roasted parsnip with roasted carrots All really good and toddler approved For desert I couldnt help myself I got the chocolate  hazelnut tart with pistachio ice cream Yum The ice cream was to die for Excellent food made even better by a wonderful staff and the bathrooms are really very luxurious Couldnt ask for more Will definitely be keeping an eye out for vouchers for this place and you should too Absolutely delicious We stayed at the Nira Caledonia for 3 nights and had complimentary breakfast in this restaurant We also had dinner here one night and it was extremely enjoyable The mussels were the best we ever had We also had the ribeye and pork chop which were scrumptious The staff is so kind and helpful and we loved the ambience Highly recommendThe OH suggested this place a while back after reading a review in Ion So when I got to choose where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner this seemed like the obvious choiceWe arrived slightly early  ordered drinks from the bar while we waited for our table The staff were friendly  attentive and we were given a choice of tables as they werent fully booked While we pondered over the menu we were given a basket of fresh bread with some interesting butters to try  strawberry  mint apple and sea salt They were different but not really to my liking I prefer my fruit garnishing my drink We shared the scallops for starter as we were both having steak for main course The scallops were lovely  perfectly cooked They were also the biggest scallops Ive ever seenFor main I had the fillet done in the Josper he had the rib eye  we shared sides of veggies  chips It was awesome I loved the smoky flavour from the Josper the mushrooms were earthy the chips triple cooked  It was by far the best steak Ive had this year After a short break we had dessert I had the chocolate fudge  he had the cheese Both were lovely  I want to go back Soon"

    "review":"Its a pity that this restaurant is hidden off the beaten track because the food here is very tasty and the service is very good I have only been to three Thai restaurants but this is by far the best one I have been to and the food has been consistently good on the four times I have been there I have found a firm favourite dish in the red curry which always tastes deliciousThe restaurant provides good value for money with the servings you get and also offers BYOB which is an added bonus on the walletThe dcor of the restaurant is pretty simple but this shouldnt take anything away from the fact that this is a hidden gem in EdinburghWhat an adorable gem of a place this is After some futile hunting around for a restaurant we spotted this place down a wee side street off the Kings Theatre Got to admit we didnt go in with high expectations but goes to show how poor my judgement isWe shared some vegetable spring rolls to start then SR had a Pad Prik Kink with chicken and I opted for Pla Rad Prik Monkfish and shared some steamed rice and fried noodles I will note that the noodles didnt work with the monkfish  steamed rice much better THe SR loved his chicken but had major food envy for my prettily arranged asparagus and monkfish the fish in a light batter had a fantastic sauce  intensely sweet intensely sour intensely spicy It was an intoxicating combination tempered with the blandness of steamed rice Prices were reasonable the staff pleasant enough it was BYOB but we didnt care and we were delighted absolutely A hidden gem indeedAbsolute Thai is a great Thai restaurant just right off the main road My girlfriend and I both got curries Red Curry and Jungle Curry which were quite good save some minor complaints This is the first Thai restaurant weve been to since moving from the United States so Im not sure if this is the norm but: the curries were completely liquid like a broth whereas the Thai curries were accustomed to are typically a bit thicker and creamier The menu did say they contained coconut cream but I did not notice any cream Still overall they were very tastyThe restaurant is small  maybe 8 tables in total  but we felt the service was inattentive There was only one employee working and it was nearly impossible to catch his eye to ask for water and for the bill It wasnt that he was constantly running around but he was never looking up If it wasnt for that Id give Absolute Thai a hearty 4 starsThis is a lovely little restaurant off the beaten track Staff are friendly  the food is delicious  great fresh  spicy flavours BYOB is a bonus too so you can enjoy with your favourite wine or beer We cant wait to go back next timeOk ok I went back to Absolute Thai and got their Tom Kha soup It was excellent Bumping up from 3 stars to 4"

    "review":"After a week in England and Scotland I declared I just want a taco  I was tired of pub food and fries chips and Taco Mazama was a welcome sight  I had a chicken burrito and a steak taco and they were exactly what I needed  The food is pretty simple standard fast food Mexican along the lines of a Qdoba or Chipotle  I only wish they had tortilla chips to go with the salsa and guacamole  I thought the price was outstanding for the amount of food I gotBeen meaning to do this review for a while This will be short and sweet as the place is TINY and not very complicated in terms of menu and such Ok  I was looking for a bite to eat one day before class and had walked past this place a million times and finally I went in Mexican food that reminds me of America is hard to come by here so i wasnt expecting much But I was pleasantly surprised when I eat here Basically you choose what you want in your burrito or whatever  they make it you eat it Nice an simple I had chicken burrito with the works They even threw guacamole and sour cream in for no extra charge Was quite pleased with this burrito as it reminded me of street food vendors in California Food was not the best I ever had but was still tasty Prices I felt were a bit steep for a single burrito But otherwise bueno and I will stop in again when I am hungry and on a time crunch Place is Aok in my bookBetter than other Mexican food Ive had in Edinburgh I got two tacos and I enjoyed them both Especially with the avocado sauce it perhaps singly made the tacos jump from eh to ah  Its a small place no atmosphere and the two guys were speaking another language which makes me a bit uncomfortable I cant get food to go because I have no where to go with the food I live far away and a park bench is not always inviting I might return and scarf some tacos but I wont hang around Now Im on the hunt for a great taco in a cool joint AnyoneI was lured in here for lunch by the gluten free sign outside and was very pleased with my decision On a gluten free diet I thought Mexican food was beyond my reach but this is not so at Taco Mazama Reasonably priced food the options are pretty basic tacos nachos or wraps but you can mix and match fillings kind of reminded me of a Mexican subway Not the place to go for a fancy meal but for a cheap lunch or dinner which tastes good and caters to a range of dietry requirements you cant go wrong They even had a chart indicating which meal options contained gluten dairy eggs nuts etc which made life so much easier You definitely need at least 2 wraps or tacos for a meal as theyre quite small but when I visited they had a deal on for 3 wraps so that wasnt a problem : will definitely return as they make dairygluten free eating easyBland and small is not how I ever want to describe mexican food ever again Sadly this is why we will be walking past mazama in the futureAfter a day of soaking in a few fringe shows I decided to stop by this wee shop to recharge my batteries my sustenance of choice was the pulled pork burrito Blah Just no I mean if youre looking for a cheap meal thatll fill you up then by all means this place is for you But heed my warning this stuff in BLAND The only flavour I got was from the jalapeos It tasted like a jalapeo on white bread Seriously do yourself the favour and pay a few more pounds at El Cartel around the corner It looks quite interesting from the outside but the interior is sparce the bainmaries are tiny and the staff do not look all that interested in what they are serving you  If youre looking for Mexican food around this area there are a few others to consider but please do yourself the favour and just avoid this one"

    "review":"I stubled across this place on Leith Walk by chance as it isnt obviously signed nor is it well established yet in the area  Its aiming for a fresh Mediterranean feel as the owners are Italian  Inside its clean and light with a small number of tables and an impressive deli counter with fresh ingredients  The service is friendly and the menu offers a good selection of cakes sandwiches and Italian specialities like pizzas calzones and pasta dishes  I had a ham and pineapple pizza which only took about five minutes to be prepared and tasted amazing  The base was nice and crisp and the topping was delicious with good quality cheese  Not only was it tasty but it was filling too and only cost 4Its a shame Elm Rose doesnt do more business as it offers friendly quick service and great food at reasonable pricesWhilst out and about today I stumbled across this little cafe situated on Elm Row at the Calton Hill end  I decided to give it a try and was not disappointedThe inside is small with around 5 or 6 tables set out each with a couple of chairs  The right hand wall was occupied by a drinks chiller with a chiller doubling as a counter at the back  They serve the normal cafe range of items  drinks small cakes and no doubt paninis and sandwiches as wellStaff greeted me with a smile and though I only bought one small piece of cake I would love to be able to go back and sample some more of their food  I find the shops on Elm Row are so easy to miss as they are set back from the road but if you venture in youll find gems like thisThis is the sort of handy little place youll want to keep coming back to  First impressions can be everything and they ticked the boxes for meThis cafe recently bought over from an Italian no surprises here has the most tempting counter of food Situated on Elm Row I would personally rather grab a bite here to go or eat at home as it is quite small but the quality of the food cant be questionedThe staff were extremely friendly and a woman who worked there assured me thered be a change of menu by the following week if she could be bothered I appreciate the numerous specials boards outside the cafe as the food changes quite often and doesnt start to bore the customersTheyve got a clever lay out as they offer ciabatas baked potatoes baguettes wraps and rolls which can be finished off with any fillings you choose yourself from the counter The baked potato with chicken filling I had was really good and to top it off they are quite cheap as wellI found this lovely little caf on route to a yoga class on a sunny Saturday morning desperate for some caffeine and a minimal breakfast which would complain if I spent lots of time bending over and touching my toes Elm Row Caf and Diner is filled with personality every wall covered with interesting things There is a well stacked bookshelf in the corner by the counter and a world map on the wall by the door with a request to pin where youve travelled It has a few tables but still feels small enough to be comfy in you are there on your own I struggled to make my mind up but ended up with an Americano and some yoghurt coated raisins which were very satisfactory The menu was vast though featuring a variety of hot and cold snacks and even Turkish coffeeGood place to grab a bite  A colleague raved about their baked potatoe which I tried and was positively stuffed  Had a Mexican wrap today which came with salad and coleslaw  Tasted great would recommend as also have prompt serviceA good place for a lunch bite  They have a few small tables and plenty of sandwiches salads and soups to choose from  I liked the buffalo chicken wraps the falafel and the soups    I found myself going back there a few times when I was staying in Edinburgh recently because the owners were friendly and the food was very good and freshly made"

    "review":"Situated in the picturesque students union building Teviot the Library Bar not to be confused with the Library Cafe is one of the nicer student bars operated by the Union which makes it a little bit more expensiveIts aptly named as there are old valuable looking books encased in glass cabinets spanning the two floors of the bar The food served here is quite wholesome and though there are snacky options such as nachos and duck springrolls they also serve a range of impressive pasta dishes and I would certainly recommend their burgers big and juicy with a generous side of chips and saladThe bar is extremely cosy and is richly decorated maybe a bit strange but the first thing I picture when I close my eyes is A LOT of polished wood Its also great for events as Ive been to a university ball there This is one of the few university cafesbars I would recommend to the average Edinburgh tourist because the food here rivals that of any other in town especially for the price and I could spend hours in those comfortable chairs maybe even fall asleepWithin Teviot there are a number of bars and the most popular has to be the Library bar It only came into existence a couple of years ago when it was decided that Teviot needed a new classy bar Since it was open I have to say it has become one of my favourite student union barsSpread over two levels with a spiral staircase connecting the two the Library Bar has a rustic old library look with a slightly more modern looking bar The majority of the bar is dominated by dark wood furnishings and many many books in the glass cabinets The bar opens really at midday when you can order lunch food is then served till quite late at night The food is good for a student bar but at times service has been slow and sometimes the food has not been as hot as it should be However apart from that drinks are at student prices and additionally you can order cocktails which are slightly more expensive The bar has acoustic open mic nights a quiz night and you can play board games ranging from Risk to Trivial PursuitThis bar is always lively during semester time and does not disappointFirst off you must be warned: Do not eat the food here Seriously I mean ok that might be a bit too harsh I may have got them on a bad day but they managed to overcook the pasta to the point that it crumbled in my mouth In a bad way Also dont order a Bloody Mary They dont understand what it is Im fairly certain the last time I did what they gave me was tomato juice with black pepper And thats it But as far as university bars go the Library Bar is the best one Its also the one that looks least like a hole Its got lots of pretty old books lining the wall But beware Youre not allowed to touch Theyre such teases To be completely frank the best and possibly only good thing about this bar is that its really cheap You can get a pint for about 250 And their range is ok I mean could be better but not totally disappointingThe Library Bar is one of my favorite hangouts in Edinburgh First of all its a bit sprawling and has two floors which makes it easy to find a place to talk more privately with a bunch of friends Also the decor is amazing  the rooms are lined with bookshelves hence the name which makes everything feel quite classy Drinks are a bit pricey and it can be difficult to jostle your way through the crowd to the bar Its worth it though The pizza is also quite goodWhy didnt my college have one of theseOkay maybe thats because we have a puritanical 21 year old drinking age and our exorbitantly priced universities would rather give bonuses to administrators than subsidize student boozing Whoops I think I just answered my own rhetorical questionBut what a place The food is three stars on a good day but very cheap as are the beverages The old woodpaneled spaces have a grand feel to them and the little spiral staircase on the end charmingly connects the two floors I came with a grad student friend and we were back again a few days laterUno de los bares de la Unin de estudiantes Lugar con ambiente indescriptible Me recuerda a las historias de Harry Potter Por la noche mucho mejor con las luces tenues iluminando las vitrinas llenas de libros Los platos son contundentes y abundantes Y no est nada mal de precio Hacen descuento a estudiantesLos Nachos chili beef deliciosos al igual que la hamburguesa de la casa la Library burger Gran variedad de bebidas a precios nada excesivos Definitivamente ste es mi punto de referencia en Edimburgo y estoy deseando volver"

    "review":"Ive never understood why Papilio is never busy They do great lunch and dinner offers and is in one of the main student areas Cheap food  students  perfect But whenever Im in here theres never an atmosphere But that doesnt put me offThis Italian restaurant is really traditional in style and taste You can tell that everything they make is made on premises and tastes really fresh As a consequence the service is a bit on the slow side but the food is delicious Hearty food Ever since my first visit Ive always gone for the Spaghetti Carbonara I know adventurous and I always have it because it is so delicious Their portion sizes are just right and everything looks delicious My mum highly recommends the Smoked Salmon pasta and she has good tastePapilio is one of the finest Italian restaurants which I have come across in Edinburgh Located in the centre of the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh it is a great place for students to go to for their lunch or dinnerThe place is quite small inside the restaurant but it gives it a cosy rather than a cramped feel and the decor is very authentically Italian with a Italian music playing in the background The atmosphere is really friendly and lively inside and the waiters were lovely and highly efficient in their service Papilio offer a wide range of authentic Italian cuisine on their menu including Pizzas pastas and risotto as well as steak and chicken dishes I had the pizza pescatora with shellfish which was delicious there didnt skimp on the topping which was good and there was lots of cheese too  yum  My friend had the spaghetti carbonara which looked amazing and she said it was lovely The prices are also excelled in Papilio and I think you would be hard pushed to another Italian restaurant in Edinburgh with the same high quality of service and delicious tasting food Papilio is now my first port of call when I fancy an Italian meal in EdinburghExcellent food and friendly service in this unpretentious Italian restaurant I had a delicious melanzane al parmigiano to start followed by a pizza with asparagus and prawns my companion had garlic mushrooms and chicken with a blue cheese sauce Couldnt quite manage a dessert each after all that Coffee was nothing special but then I dont go to restaurants for the coffee Their lunch menu is an especially good deal and from the chatter I overheard between waiters and patrons they clearly have a lot of customers who keep coming backDidnt make a reservation but they were able to slip us in It was a busy Friday night  Food and service was outstanding  I recommend you reserve a table for dinner just so youre not disappointedWhen my friend suggested we go and try this place I decided to do a bit of stalking first and look at their website  partly because I didnt know anyone whod ever been here before and partly because it was a distraction from revising for my finalsTheir website looked really upmarket with promises of amazing service and dedication to preparing the best and freshest food etc etc so I was expecting it to be quite priceyI wouldnt have minded paying twice as much as we did for the food if not more our meal was that good We went for their 3 Course Set Lunch offer which will set you back a grand total of 650 a head  and this place is now my favourite Italian restaurant in EdinburghIts nothing fancy but then it doesnt try to be: from the second you walk in you immediately pick up on the familyrun authentic vibe and it makes you feel really relaxed I love italian food and Ive been searching all over Edinburgh for that perfect little local Italian place the one you go to when you cant be bothered to cook but still want to go somewhere you know will be good yet cheap Ive lived here for 4 years now and I think I can stop lookingPapilio is one of several Italian restaurants located on Bruntsfield Place and fairs well in comparison especially in terms of value for money  The service is friendly and inviting from the moment you walk in the front door and cater for your every need with making you feel encroached  The majority of the food is cooked to order and it takes a while to arrive as a result but is worth the wait without a doubt  I have only tried their dinner menu but I noticed that they serve a three course lunch throughout the week for less than 7 which looks an excellent dealTheir menu has an unually wide selection of dishes  There are different pizzas as well as pastas ranging from gnochi to ravioli but they also serve veal steak and fish cooked in a variety of sauces  Further they give an assurance of the freshness and quality of their ingredients which is backed up by the amazing flavour of the food I chose and would definitely recommend the Penne Della Cassa which had spicy sausage in a creamy tomato sauce  Papilio certainly deserves a look as it offers great food and service at surprisingly low prices"

    "review":"Corner Pizza is a decent place to grab a decent pizza and the prices are pretty good as well although there are other Pizzerias in the city that do give better value for money However if you live local then its a great place to go to The restaurant does not do deliveries but if you call them up you can preorder a pizza so that is ready when you get thereWhen I came here I ordered a 12 pepperoni pizza and it was 6 which is pretty good although the pizza was more greasy than normal and I used a tissue to absorb areas of excess greaseThe drink prices here were also pretty expensive so I decided to go to a local offlicense to get a drink there instead Corner pizza also do other food items as well such as kebabs burger chips and a range of Ben and Jerry ice creamsIts not the most healthy food in the world but takeaways rarely are but it tastes great and the service is friendly We often pick up last minute meals there with the kids They love choosing the toppings Great value too"

    "review":"This is a clean bright chippy that does all the usual plus kebabs and pizza The chips are consistant and the large fish great value Always plenty staff and they deliver A long time ago this used to the a great wee pub called the Bluebell They used to do a great steak pie Porty has a few chippys but this is the only one Id useBeing so close to the sea Portobello is obviously going to have a fair few fish and chips shops to choose from and this is a good one to go for and located on Portobello High Street it is only a couple of hundred metres from the beach front I have been here twice and the chips are always really tasty and the portions pretty good The batter on the haddock can be a bit greasy but it provides good value for money The restaurant itself is very spacious and you get plenty of room to be comfortable in your surroundings if you choose to eat in The restaurant does not only do fish and chips but also kebabs pizzas and baked potatos so will cater for most peoples tastes The place also offers a delivery service if you cant bring yourself to go there in person"

    "review":"middling italian fare on the grassmarket you could do much worse in the UK  think bella italia but you could also do better its a fine place to enjoy a slightly better than average italian meal on a sunny dayI have been twice to eat at this establishments and twice I have left disappointed No  I dont have a horror story from the place or that the service was bad Quite the opposite our waiter on both occasions was just fine nothing too specialIts that I left feeling I had a rather mediocre over priced meal I am no great cook but I hate it when I order a meal only to be presented with something  I can easily make at home for a 16th of the price I like to order stuff I usually dont have often and I was disappointed at this place as it falls in the mediocre range of Italian restaurants I suppose it just falls back on all the tourists it gets because of its location and doesnt try and compete with some of the other truly excellent Italian restaurants we have in the City However just because you are in a touristprime location doesnt mean you should slack on your menuPlus the Italian song on repeat gets tiresome The interior feels a bit tired and in need for a bit of a revamp There are some other better eateries in the area so I wouldnt bother too much with this place unless something dramatic happensI visited Gennaro Ristorante about a week ago and came away feeling like it could be doing a lot better  Its a pleasant familyrun business which aims to provide value for money authentic Italian food for locals and tourists alike  The staff are friendly and it offers a nice setting to relax and enjoy your meal in  We sat outside and the food didnt take long to arriveThe main problem was that the menu just didnt offer anything we have all seen before  It only had the standard pizza and pasta dishes the most adventurour of which was a mixed seafood tagliatelle  I went for the pepperoni pizza which was quite nice although the cheese wasnt rich enough and the sausage was a little frazzled  Our meals came to about 650 each a little steep for what they wereI went to Gennaro Ristorante one day for dinner several months ago and I thought it was fairly average I was cold wet and hungry that day and would have eaten anywhere and so I didnt have high expectations of a fantastic meal but I was still pretty disappointed with this place The outside of the restaurant looks really good and inviting but inside I thought it was pretty dull and our tables definitely wasnt clean The menu offered a good choice of authentic Italian dishes including pasta and pizzas I had a ham and mushroom pizza which was pretty tasteless and they skimped on the toppings and the cheese  never good Most of the main courses are priced at around six pounds which is fairly reasonable and the portion sizes are fairly generous I complained to the staff that my glass was dirty and they apologised and brought me a new one  which still wasnt all that cleanGennaro Ristorante is a pretty average Italian restaurant but there are much better Italian restaurants in the city which are worth visiting insteadWow  bad reviews We split the chicken They split it for us and subbed for a second salad Portions were huge And it was flavourful Waitress had an edge but we liked it overall They were open late which was a plusAmazingly cozy and friendly I loved the busy atmosphere and the food was superb and delicious They served this peppermint like tea with lemon was so amazing Their bruschetta and pasta are so mouthwatering Dinning with them three nights in a row is something I will never regret Keep up the great work"

    "review":"My friends dont know sushi please apply Jenny Ls disclaimer here also as it turns out I am the ignorant oneIm hungover and need to have something tasty for lunch which is actually my breakfast Im torn between a huge bowl of pasta or sushi my health conscious side says go for sushi dont risk sending your body into carb lock down  even if those meatballs do look awesome So sushi is the choice dcor in this place is attempted modern Japanese schoolgirl prints and mangaesque patterns I dont find that offensive service is fast which is good because hungover Tom has little patience I opted against a bento box and went ofr a mixed sashimi plate which also came with Miso The Miso is good I ordered an iced green tea it wasnt so good The Sushi comes in good time and I devour it like the homeless kid in Santa Clause the Movie just without the fingerless gloves and the snow and Im not homeless just hungoverThe food was good not a bad sushi experience by my standards but certainly not ground breakingIf you wanna eat japanese food you must not go there That is not taste in food And many people come herebut i think most of them are tourist U waste money on there You live or tour in edinburgh you just go another way  If u have to go to japanese food restaurant you can go yosushi not yessishi It is better Trust meBefore I delve into the thick of it heed this warning: for reasons I will disclose shortly this post shall be marred by subjectivity and a greedy unquenchable imagination Ill explain I met two thenandnow friends and a notthenbutnowsortof acquaintance at the joint in question for a bit of innocent hobnobbing and knickknacking les mots darting from this to that to the other thing The constellation of our discourse however would have but a lone especially luminous star cluster paling all others This specimen: Italian food Mouths watered and eyes leaked as our MVP titillated the gray matter with tales of eating whatever they eat in Italy Pining for memories and words that werent mine lusting for sensations hitherto undreamt of anonymous unnamed I waited for my udon Now you see the dilemma Any meal following such an evocative and exquisite foodrelated encounter with a past that is not yours is sure to mar the foodrelated consumption at hand This was Im happy to disclose only partly the case The udon of YES SUSHI held up well enough in the fight against my greedy imagination But it wasnt Italian foodReally really wanted to give you a three star but couldnt bring myself to but I will get to that  I was pleasantly impressed with the food it wasnt crazy good but still tasty I went for the all you can eat sushi I was sad the all you can eat menu wasnt as big as I hoped and I went for the cheap option  they have to save some money or people like me would eat them out of home but that was ok The food was presented nicely which is huge for me Sushi just tastes better when its pretty The prices were reasonable so I cant complain there Ok the thing that got me and call me crazy  I felt segregated from the rest of the restaurant because I am not asian Just throwing it out there not being racist or trying to offend anyone or anything I just felt that way When i walked into the establishment the people that were there were all Asian and sitting at various tables near the kitchen  which is where I wanted to sit but I was given a table  as far away as possible I then noticed a few Asian couples come in and given tables near the kitchen and where all the action was I though naw Im being silly but then another nonasian couple came in and were given the table directly next to me and my girlfriend  There were plenty of tables near the kitchen and but they were placed as far away as possible as if both of us couples had the bubonic plague and we might start  spreading it and sending Edinburgh back into the Middle Ages  So thats why I couldnt give the third star   My girlfriend felt the same way when I mentioned it to her after we left If you want decent sushi though dont let this deter you it was good and I will be coming back not just to see if Im segregated again but to try the buffet again as wellApparently in Glasgow you can get sushi to takeaway everywhere or so it would seem if you listen to my visiting sister In Edinburgh I think the choice is more limited I know theres Miso  Sushi but it doesnt deliver to my flat so on our way home from a book festival event we popped by Yes Sushi to fulfil her cravingsThoughts  well its a lot bigger inside that the outside would suggested but diners are pretty crammed in and the famous hot pots they serve mean they have electrical cables all over the floor Itd be a much better and safer idea to ask an electrician to install more sockets or even sockets at the tablesPrice wise the sushi isnt too bad but a lot of it seems pretty expensive  I ordered one of the selections from the front page of the takeaway menu which cost nearly 14 It was nice several types of sushi and some sashimi but not lots  certainly not enough to justify the price  My sister was pleased with her choices but again not cheap Everything tasted good mind and if I was in town I might be inclined to pop in for food especially as the hot pots looked interesting but I wouldnt go out of my way  but it did fulfil our sushi needsThis review will take the form of a note to myself reminding me what to order if I find myself at Yes Sushi again:Agedashi tofu  disappointing Dont get it againAvocado maki  goodMiso soup  okVeggie gyozas  good enough to eat againIn summary a very hitormiss vegetarian selection Service was fine Atmosphere a bit fastfoody for my tastes The search for my favorite Japanese restaurant in Edinburgh continues"

    "review":"Visited this spot in Hanover street during a couple of its previous incarnations and always thought it was a nice space so was looking forward to seeing what theyd done with it If youre looking to go over the weekend Id suggest you book in advance It does seem to get pretty busy and as a result we ended up in the backroom which can feel a little removed from the action Im not sure why the people who arrived no more than two minutes after us were able to secure a table in the much bigger brighter and more atmospheric main room after looking a bit dissapointed at being stuck in the back Ive decided life is too short to make a fuss over things like this though The lunchtime menu was smallish the prices were cheap and the food was simple no nonsense stuff with plenty of flavour The only criticism Id have is the size of the portions which left me wanting more My sausage tomato and butterbean stew cost less than 5 but Id happily have paid more for a bigger portion Id go back to The Dogs again since there was more than enough on the menu Id like to try I think Ill be ordering a starter next time too unless those portions get bigger thoughRequested a Chefs choice meal  it was great  We had the braised lardon and prune stuffed lamb heart for appetizer and Albion fish casserole and skirlie and bacon stuffed pork belly  all were very delicious For dessert the lemon posset was light and tasty  a perfect end to a wonderful mealIf this was my mum reviewing The Dogs itd be getting 5 stars Im pretty sure shes its biggest fan Me I really like it but not loveIve been a couple of times before and been turned away without a booking before too  which speaks volumes as to its popularity in Edinburgh Last night though despite it being a Sunday during the festival we were lucky and secured a table for four after just turning up in hope We were told we couldnt order food for 20 minutes but drinks and bread were fine and Im fairly certain it was less than 20 mins when the waiter returned to take our orderMy dad was the only one to order a starter their Big Fat soup of the day  pork and vegetable And my was it big and fat It was so thick that it was more of a stew than a soup and he commented that had he realised he wouldnt have ordered it  fearing hed be too full for mainsSister had an amazing looking fish and chips HUGE fish and I stole a deliciously fluffy and crispy chip mum had rabbit rissotto dad had the Albion fish stew and I went for braised rabbit The fish stew was entirely fish no seafood and as a result not only very filling but also rather samey  although admittedly very nice My rabbit was okay with the accompanying dauphinoise cake a particular highlightAnd then to puddings Mum is a massive fan of the lemon posset and it once again lived up to its reputation Glorious But the berry and apple tart dad and I ordered was more of a disappointment The flavours were fine and the aniseed custard was subtle But it was so cold it was verging on frozen Cold tart and cold custard It just didnt work and the freezing cold fruit was actually starting to irritate my teethAlas too we were in the small room and through no fault of The Dogs were fighting to talk over the next table Very loud Fringe typesSo all in all The Dogs is still a good restaurant and my mum probably still loves it but its not perfect and the fruit tart let down an otherwise pleasant mealThe Dogs is a great solid go to restaurant in the new town Always lovely of  an evening after work hours when the place is busy and full of buzzing conversationI especially love going here in the winter months when the decor helps you feel cosy and the food comforts you from the inside out A great place for a carafe of red wine while the nasty Scottish weather blows about outside the big New Town windowsThe food is modern hearty fare with a nice take on Scottish produce The menu is small but with enough choices for meat lovers and veggies alike and everything I have tasted as been delicious The steak is a big favourite served simply with garlic butter large wedge fries and a grilled tomatoReservations are good to make on Thursday Friday  Saturday evenings and it is great for taking out of town visitors before heading out on the townLoved the decor of the place and the food was pretty good The hake fillet was beautifully cooked as were the ox cheeks The mushroom risotto however was a bit lacking in seasoning and flavorThe restaurant consists of a large beautiful sunny dining room and then a small back room with poor lighting where all the foreigners are seated When we got to the restaurant there were plenty of tables available in the bright sunny area and we also had reservations The host seated us in the back room with 4 other tables operated by Americans Later he seated a Russian couple in the room who actually complained that they wanted to sit in the other room The host insisted that the room was only available for people who made reservations but in the next 30 minutes or so the room had cleared out and there were plenty of tables available  Although the food was good I would not recommend this place to any fellow Americans as the seating segregation left a poor taste in my mouthWe found th dogs via lonely planet Looked like and interesting menu and they had vegetarian haggis  we didnt wind up getting it but we went because we were curiousFirst the food: just ok Sort of a variant on heavy meat and potato pub food Satisfying and somewhat  hearty but nothing earth shatteringly new or wonderful I had the pork shoulder pie it is cooked in a small casserole dish a stew o f pork shoulder with the standard carrots and what I think might have been butternut squash It came terrifyingly hot and very watery I was expecting the broth in the pie to be more saucy It was rather bland too took lots of salt Really kind of an average beef stew with pork instead wound up mixing the potato crust in and then after about 15 minutes it cooled off enough to eat and resembled stew MehThe steak was steak and ok Standard Kind of expensive for flat iron steak 7a cheap cut normally The pea and bean soup was actually very good we all thought Nicely doneAtmosphere: we ate early 5:00 and it is a big room on the second floor with a few too many tables in it Bare decor no music one waitress and no bartender Kind of weirdOk now for the 2 stars they really mishandled an easily better handled situation when our server who was nice enough otherwise knocked in to my wifes hand and caused wine to spill all over her No rushing to get bar towels or napkins no apologies or offers for help not even a visit from the owner or a formal apology in fact she had to ask to have her wine taken off the ticket No offer for a free desert really kind oft related us like it was our fault at least that was our perception It seems as if someone there can cook I just think they need to bolster their execution Ok place but if you are searching for new or clever you might be let down"

    "review":"Id heard nothing but good things about Nandos in the past but never actually visited one I have to admit it was a pretty enjoyable experience The Fountain park branch is only a few minutes walk from my flat so made it an easy choice for Sunday dinner when feeling too lazy to cook The place was big enough that we didnt have to queue to get a table but not so cavernous that it ruins any atmosphere Being a bit of a chicken wing fan I went straight for the portion of 10 with a side of chips I am Scottish after all My partner has a quarter chicken with sides of rice and coleslaw The staff member at the counter asked if wed visited Nandos before and told us we were very brave opting for the hot sauce as first time visitors Were fans of spicy food though and would probably have rated this more medium than hot Just a pleasant amount of heat with plenty of flavour If theres not enough heat in the marinade for you they prvide bottles of sauce of each heat level to take to your table so you can spice it up til your hearts content The wings were perfectly cooked with the meat just falling off the bone Chips are chips and I cant think of anything exciting to say about them With topups of your soft drink also included and a takeaway service available Ill be more than happy to become a regular at NandosHaving been to Nandos in the past albeit quite a few years ago I pretty much knew what to expect here and certainly as far as the quality of the food and the general service were concerned Ive no complaints I do not however think that the restaurant is particularly good value for money  12 for an ordinary sized wrap with two modest servings of riceveg is steep The pricing structure across the board is also rather bizarre Where else charges 301 for a beer never mind that one of them is Super Bock which Oddbins practically give away not that its a bad beer in any way Possibly this is due to the recent vat change but it strikes me they could either have absorbed that or repriced in a more sensible manner rather than littering the menu with pence amounts of 13 26 64 etc On this visit they also ran out of knives and those on the go looked rather less than totally clean although that could have just been dishwasher smears and they could do with a larger soft drink dispenser as on busy nights it appears to run out of content on a regular basis due to the free refills available For 2nd tier fast food I would choose the La Tasca or TGI Fridays chains above NandosIt is a testament to Nandos that despite this being one of the bigger restaurants it has that there always seems to be long queues to get a table As Mark says this is the first option people opt for when they go to Fountain Park and there is a very good reason for this because the food is so tastyI can be a bit of a pig when I go here my usual choice I go for is the 12 chicken bathed in several layers of chicken peri perisauce with this I usually order a side of chips and a corn on the cob You can get garlic bread as a side but I would suggest against this you only get a couple of slices and it really doesnt provide you with good value for money This meal comes to around 9 but considering a meal at Burger King costs around 6 the few extra quid really is worth it and puts them a cut above such fast food jointsI like Nandos as its reasonable and very quick if you are trying to catch a film The staff are a mixed bunch but on the whole nice I think that they are just young and not so used to dealing with customersNot great for vegetarians but if you like chicken youre sortedStill on 4 Stars just  that is solely on the strenghts of their chicken They taste good very good The menu has been amended to include some more meats and vegetarian dishes They introduced beef and chicken thighs The service is friendly helpful and efficient The tables are clean not sticky as I originally noticed in my previous review I like the refillable icewater and bottemless soft drinks Their sauces include new varieties Garlic Lemon Wild Herb which are tasty and hot Their fries however have taken a battering  see what I did here  they were a little limp and soft with minumum of peri peri salt Still a great contender in the Edinburgh Wings quest  If there was one perhaps I should start oneThis place is magical I wish we had this back in the States Chicken is always perfectly seasoned and tender to the bone Potato mash is flavorful and filling Coleslaw is great as well I originally waited about a month to eat here even though I live right across the street from it and once I finally did eat Ive been craving it ever since"

    "review":"Im a fan of momandpop restaurants particularly where you go in and the people make you feel like family and are friendly  Starving for hot meal I dashed across the Meadows to Hongs a tiny Chinese restaurant located about 2 blocks south of Melville in the quiet Marchmont area  Sandwiched between produce stores and boutiques Hongs offers a cozy dining room for table service along with takeaway  carryout service  Their menu is extensive and wellpriced for the portions  I recommend the combo special which is just under 7 pounds and includes a can of coke giant bag of fried chips dont know the name but theyre tasty an entree plus rice  having a penchance for spicy foods I inquired if they would make a particular dish spicyand they happily obliged  The wonton soup is solid but the chicken mushroom dish which also includes scallions was great  Ill definitely go back whenever Im in the area and if not theres a cheap delivery service for only 1 poundReally disappointed in my takeaway from here I ordered a Chinese dish of chicken spring onion and ginger and asked for some garlic to be thrown in which it wasnt and my girlfriend ordered a Thai dish Both looked exactly the same  colourless and gloopy My Tom Yum soup was only half full and contained nothing more than some decent stock but only two prawns The worst part of my meal was the boiled rice which was dry hard and brittle Probably the worst rice Ive had from a take awayAll of these negative points is really down to the place cutting corners and presumably heating things up in microwaves I think the rice was heated in the oven because it came in the foil tray When you get spongy chicken and colourless veg in microwaveable dishes you know its not going to be good AvoidMy new local takeaway I was recommended by a friend and can say he was not wrong good food with reasonable prices not had it delivered thats why I have not given 5 starsOne hungover Sunday morning read early evening I leapt read fell out of bed and brightly made my way to the kitchen to make myself a gourmet dinner using a Heston Blumenthal recipe read shouted at my flatmate where the hell are the takeaway menus As a rule I have been mightily unimpressed with the Chinses takeaways in Edinburgh they are overpriced and I always think Ive accidentally received an extra soup before realising its my poor little beef chow mein trying desperately to keep from drowning in grease However fear not my trusty beef noodles with Hongs you will be safe from a slow greasy death I have finally found a Chinese takeaway where I dont genuinely fear a coronary attack after a binge The dishes are well cooked flavoursome and there is a huge variety However the best part is the price chow mein or to be fancy udon for 450 that grease must have gone to your head boyo I hear you say but nay my friends I speak the truth There are also meal deals for 3 or 4 people and a family meal and cards are accepted To cap it all off theyve dabbled successfully I might add in the Thai market Although a more limited menu and slightly more expensive than the Chinese the food is excellent and considerably cheaper than other Thai takeawaysPopped in a couple of times now after a colleague reccomened this place on the strength of there salt and pepper chips We rocked up last night after few polite drinks at the argyle and decied to try out a few more dishes The veg tempura wasnt on so that was s bit disappointing but we went for vegetable fried rice and asked to make this very spicy This was great really nice and the chef didnt hold back on the spice The much discussed salt and pepper chips were great They seem to be chips stirfried with veg chillis ginger and soy sauce It sounds wweird but it is actually amazing well it is once you have had a few beers The other options we had were quite standard fair Spring rolls etc All in thumbs up Worth popping in now and again for some standardish chinese foodMarchmonts Best ChineseI believe this is the case but my research hasnt been all exhaustive Its on one of the most eclectic streets in the area which includes the great Argyle Bar an awesome fruit shop a wee coffee shop a yoga place and a sauna I drink in the argyle quite a bit and normally need some form of food when Im heading home Hongs is my preferred location As Shona F said their ribs are pretty damn good and Im a fan of all the usually I think the secret is in their sauces  they do a really mean Peking sauce and the chilli salted chicken wings are the bomb  the portions are really good also though not cheap it is value for money"

    "review":"This is my favourite Chinese eatery in town I was fortunate to live close by and visited it since its opening day It was much less busy then and I had interesting conversations with the friendly  hardworking boss about life That was when I found out about his wealth of experience as a chef and the fact that his famous beef noodle soup is of a secret recipe The thick  chewy noodles and dumplings are all handmade with manually operated noodles machines from scratch and the beef soup has been boiled for hours on end I visited the eatery less frequently after moving away but the recent change of menu is drawing me back more frequently again Some of my favourite Chinese dishes such as stewed ribs and mapo tofu are featured and they are absolutely delicious Definitely visit this place for a hearty meal at a good valueI have been coming here since its opening This is the best Chinese I have had ever The noodles are delicious and really authentic I have taken my friends here from China and from Singapore and they love it as well This little cozy place gets the Asian seal of approval The owner puts on a one man show waiting cooking and running the whole operation He is really sweet and makes the place feel so homey and inviting The menu is great I personally love the DanDan mein noodles with peppery sauce and the zhajiangmian noodles with soybean sauce The guo tie fried dumplings are also an all time favorite here He also as some really traditional dishes like jellyfish and a fungus dish All in all they too are delicious So if you havent already figured it out Tasty Noodle is an amazing one man show for everyone to have a glimpse into the street foods of Chinese cuisine and just absolutely tasty foodThis place used to be a Korean cafe Ong Gie that I enjoyed frequenting until it upped sticks and hopped across to the other side of town The space lay empty for a while so I was excited to walk past and see the lights on and the window steamed up againFirst things first this place is teeny I make a point of sizing up my restaurants based on how many beds can fit in the room and this is definitely no more than two double bed territory There is a downstairs which was used by previous owners for seating so it may be available for larger groups but Ive never been down there in its latest incarnation Decorwise its back to basics  tables stools chop sticks and thats about it Homemade noodles and dumplings are the focus of the menu You can keep a watchful eye on the chefwaiterowner its a oneman show prepare your meal as the dining area looks straight into the kitchen Hes got skills I can only aspire to knock up a hot bowl of steaming noodles in the time he does Before you know it theyre on the table This makes it the perfect spot for a quick pit stop between shows during the FringeService can be a bit awkward as the owner speaks very little English If you have any queries about allergies etc youll likely be out of luck On my first visit this also resulted in a dish being ordered incorrectly Luckily this had a happy ending as said dish turned out to be awesome kelp in a garlicchilli sauce Almost every time Ive been in at least 2 or 3 of the other diners been eating or have ordered the beef noodles I think these must be developing a following from the local Asian student population so theyve been nudged up to the priority item for my next visit My only niggles is that Ive now tried to order the whelk dumplings on three occasions and each time they havent been available I have a suspicion its a case of the menu being in need of an update but the language barrier stops me from being able to verify Im always on high alert when a venue uses superlatives in their name but on this occasion its more than justified  Tasty Noodle it isThis is a lieOrders: tomato and egg noodle Fee:  6 Waiting time: 5mins Taste: the noodle was a little salty But this is hand made noodle chawing ducilitily which belongs to north of ChinaAlthough I think chef should put some sugar in tomato and eggs it still make me full and happy Atmosphere: As many Chinese noodle restaurant its decoration is very simple The pepper oil and vinegar are exactly setting on table like Chinese wayBacking wills: if I have time I will go there every weekendPS: I love Chinese food"

    "review":"Now heres a pleasant surprise Following the checkin of a regular Yelper I came across this place thanks again SaraDisclaimer: I love Eastern European and Russian foodNow that weve got that out of the way Ill also say its not everyones thing you wont necessarily get the complexity or presentation as you would from say a French restaurant but after a night out or on a cold day you just cant beat this type of food for me and whether it be Asian Eastern European or American fatty has never said no to any type of dumpling NOMThe gentlemen that served us was super nice and made us feel at home Im not sure if there hours are different but us and several others were in far past the closing hours on Yelp for our particular evening and there wasnt even the slightest hint of please hurry quite literally the oppositeIf youre familiar with this type of food then just head on down the dumplings pierogi were top notch and everything else we sampled was spot on as well traditional bigos borscht mix of salads  I honestly cant wait to get back at some point We even made room for one of the waffles which was also great and a good way to close out the mealThe place itself isnt too large but suitable at the moment there was work going on the building on the outside so it was a bit hard to actually see the place initially but hopefully when its done it will stand out a bit and be easier to spot My only gripe is that no cards are accepted but the foods too good to let that stand in the way they also dont serve beer or alcohol but while a slight inconvenience it really does save you money in the end and they let you keep a few in their fridge while you work through your meal If this isnt youre type of food then I doubt this place will convert you but if youre generally a fan or havent tried it yet and are looking for a different type of comfort food then do yourself a favour and give these guys a chance its five stars for me no doubt but I can see four for many others I wont hold it against them :Had a delicious meal here dinner crpes potato pancakes chicken Devolay rolled stuffed with spinach Well prepared each dish cooked personally excellent flavor Really enjoyed our dinnerMy boyfriend and I decided to eat here during our visit to Edinburgh and it was a fantastic experience We called ahead to reserve as we saw from reviews that the place was fairly small We neednt have worried however as it wasnt crowded perhaps because we were eating a bit later than usual We were warmly welcomed and the waiter was extremely attentive and helpful  wonderful service We had read reviews about crpes but it seems the menu has recently changed to focus more on traditional Polish dishes This obviously wasnt a problem for us given that we came to try Polish cuisine as neither of us was very familiar with it We opted for a starter of haggis filled pierogi and beetroot soup with the chicken roullade and the tasting platter for mains The platter came with three different salads pierogi yes we knew this when we ordered the starter  pierogi is delicious stew sauerkraut and chips We shared the plates and by the end we were ridiculously full We couldnt bring ourselves to fully finish the salads as the portions were so generous We couldnt even entertain the idea of dessert even though it sounded fantastic from the description we were given On the way out we were given some magnets to choose from for a souvenir I choose the one with the image of the yellow bench that is outside that has the inscription By sitting on this bench I am open to conversation with a complete stranger The Yellow Bench is a really lovely charming restaurant with fantastic food and is a great introduction to Polish cuisine Youre missing out if you dont try itHad classic sweet crepe and the polish tea which is  black tea with honey and lemon piece there Not much seats in there looks like about 4 or 5 table Good place for drop by and have some drinksNow this is my type of place Edinburgh you are getting to look all the same The inspired British food cough is no longer cutting it and every new bar that opens up looks a lot like the last new bar that opened up Yellow Bench doesnt They have promised that there is indeed a Yellow Bench to be on display at some point Where else can I get an authentic Polish meal where you know the recipes come from a homemade Polish Mom kitchen There were amazing weird little salads and perogies and delicious potato pancakes and I was just happy as a clam The best part is its not horribly expensive it feels homey and the food is not constructed its a MEAL Its made with love and fresh ingredients and if the waitress had shouted into the back to ask if they had a replacement ingredient the chef would have come out and given us a random selection of whatever they had because its small and its quaint and its Polishish still Yelp Sometimes not often but sometimes you fuck places up Do not ruin this place for me I will murder you in your sleep that is a mock threat Yelp Legal Team see here: http:wwwyoutubecomwatchvQEdXhH97Z7EThis place is adorable and homelike and friendly and delicious and I love it and I want to bring everyone I like here and no one I dont likeYellow Bench has a Yellow Bench outside It does when its open For this reason I marched straight past it when it wasnt quite open yet and realised too late that I had gone too far and so from being slightly early to meet Sara C I went to being slightly late But no matter The bench was there when I returned and bears the charming legend BY SITTING ON THIS BENCH I AM OPEN TO CONVERSATION WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER Theres one of these outside Zupa too One weekend when I have a free moment I intend to go and sit on that benchBut anywayYellow Bench is a sweet and small establishment on Leith Walk with a splendid line in Polish food Theyve got a creperelated checkin deal of which I totally need to take advantage sometime since they also have a mighty fine crepe menu and I am a sucker for those flipping flippies On this particular occasion however I had veggie golabki a beautiful and flavoursome medley of vegetarian yummies and rice all stuffed into a cabbage leaf container kind of like a floppy green burrito covered in yummy sauce This was my first taste of Polish food and I confess I might be converted  It was deeLISHSo Yellow Bench you are yet another lovely thing that I have found in my new neighbourhood hat tip to Sara C and I am very happy to be living near you thank you"

    "review":"So I have ventured back into Jashans twice this year and all I can add to my original review is that the hotter curries have improved enough to warrant another star I have had a vindaloo and a madras and there were subtle differences in the flavour and just the right difference in heat tastyThing is while I am happy to say the restaurant has improved this could be bad for my waistline as I live just round the corner Oh well it is always good to have another option for curryWe recently moved to this part of town and are venturing to try to find our new local spots for lazy night take out I love Indian and would argue it is something that never tastes the same at home but my experience at Jashans made me think differently We called on a Friday night and granted probably the busiest night for takeout but there phone manor was very rushed and not very organised as my boyfriend was passed to two different people and then someone tried to dial out while we were on the line They said delivery would take an hour so we opted to collect it as I was to hungry to waitWe order garlic naan butter chicken potatoesokra and onion bhaji It did come well presented and neatly packed but needless to say the food was so disappointing It didnt taste bad but it certainly did not taste like Indian food Mine was suppose to be medium but was super oily and had no spice or real flavour to speak of It was like tomato paste and oil had been partly mixed in but nothing else and the okra had no flavour I dont eat meat but I tried the sauce for the butter chicken and it tasted just like honey and no spice there either My boyfriend said the chicken tasted overcooked and he was no impressed with my dish either The naan was very dry and lacked any hit of garlic which was super disappointing The onion bhaji tasted nice but could have been crispier It did some with some nice sauces but not sure what they were some sort of mild chili sauce maybeOverall it wasnt a good experience and for over 20 it definitely wasnt worth it As nothing made an impression on us we arent keen to go back and give it a second chance I read the reviews beforehand and since they are seem fairly positive I was surprised it was so far from the taste I was expecting I would not recommend this place to anyone and will continue my search for good take out near byit was sunday night it was late it was cold it had been snowing on and off all weekend neither me or my boyfriend could face cooking dinner so we decided to finally try jashans which had opened up down the street from his flat a number of months ago  we phoned our order in and headed over to pick it upi was a bit shocked entering the restaurant itself as it really rather quite posh looking  all rich sumptious colours and dark wooden tables  i was definitely impressed perhaps less so when we had at least three different waiters come up to us to ask what our take away order was  um we already ordered and we are just waiting for the food now it also took about three attempts to pay  about 10 minutes after our arrival though we had paid and the food was brought to us and we hopped in the car to head homei unpacked the items which included poppadums onion salad garlic chicken green herb chicken saag aloo pilau rice and a peshwari naan  i did like that the food came in tupperwares which meant for less chance of an accidental spillage while carrying it from car to flat but i found that the food was barely on the hot side more warm moving to room temperatureto be fair the curries were perfectly nice and i really enjoyed the naan it was lovely and coconuty and sweet but without that weird hideous orange dyed coconut colour that you usually get  but i felt like this place fell short of the other amazing curry houses that edinburgh has to offer as i can really only describe my meal as nice and not overly memorable  it was also a bit more expensive than i would have expected for a takeaway  so sadly its only AOK and i may encourage my boyfriend to order from a different establishment the next time we opt for an indian to take awayJashans it is you not me Over the last few weeks I have been making an effort to try new and different curry places sadly this has had a knock on effect Jashans just isnt as good as many of the options on Gorgie or Dalry road which are both easily within walking distance and deliver to the area Im going to do a bit of a deconstruction so here are the places that for me Jashans has got it wrong:1 The takeaway set meal  normal practice if a set meal is offered in an Indian is to provide a starter a classic curry the ones everyone has heard of and some sort of rice or nan offering This is not the case in Jashans It is just 1 standard starter main side and rice  plain nan The lack of variance means you wont take advantage of the set meal very often2 It is expensive All the curry shops in the area are cheaper and most are at least as good or more likely better for example 325 for pilau rice one of the most expensive I have seen3 Still on rice I just dont like their pilau something in the flavour and tried the ghee batt 350 for rice fried in ghee with onion as a replacement Sadly this was a clean white colour that tasted a little of ghee but didnt look friedOk that is my big three but I have an overall sense that Jashans perhaps believe they dont need to compete being the only Indian on Slateford Road and hey they seem to have got away with it this long Thing is I have no issue walking an extra 10 minutes heck it might even make the curry a bit healthier or so I will tell myself The curry itself is still ok but this curry lover has found better options so I doubt Ill be backI do love this place but Im only going for 4 stars as this review is based on takeaway not the full restaurant experienceIt has been opened now for about a year and replaced Oscars on Slateford Road There is a restaurant which seems to do pretty good business I popped in before 7 on a Friday for a takeaway and it was pretty full which is always a good sign with lots of other popping in to collect takeaway tooTheir takeaways are awesome First visit at New Years was for meal deal for 2 and we added extra bits pakora naan extra rice on to make it a meal for 3  seriously there was tons of food even feeding three with pub munchies meant there was still another meal and a bit left for another day Meat is cooked amazingly  we had a chicken korma and there was a lamb dish with mint whose name escapes me I would never order lamb normally and didnt intend on even trying it but it was awesome Totally melt in the mouth gorgeousness I tried to look for it last night but probably missed it on the menu due to tiredness and starvation so I opted for a chicken dupiaza It was lovely subtly spiced tomatoey sauce with huge chunks of tender chicken and slices of red and green peppers and onions  yum I ordered boiled rice to go with it and when I opened the bag at home not only did I have my order but a 2 little tubs containing a chopped onion salad and some mango chutney I think this is a Jashans thing as there is always some kind of salad and sauce thing that comes extra which is a nice touch So yep Jashans is worth checking out There are deals on for the restaurant on Sundays and lunchtimes during the weekif you fancy a bargain lunch treat The staff are lovely and the restaurant is really nicely decorated very modern but with lots of red orange and gold accents to reflect the Indian and Bangladeshi themeI was really happy to see a curry house open on Slateford road in part it always struck me as odd that there are 4 now 5 I think Chinese style takeaways or restaurants yet no IndianHowever Jashans is a mixed bag I cant fault the quality of the meat and the milder curries are decent however the spicier dishes lack any differentiation outside of an extra chopped chili or some chunks of garlic they all use the same base sauce giving no depth to the flavour Perhaps the demand simply isnt there for the spicier dishes and thus when one is ordered it is an exception however this doesnt excuse that it  feels like there is a lack of care in these dishesJashans is ideal for those that enjoy milder curries but if you are looking for something a little hotter madras or similar there are definitely better places"

    "review":"First time trying this place as it is a bit out of the way  Went here for anniversary dinner as we are avid sushi lovers  We ordered the snow roll the most unique and tastiest roll we thought the salmon set spicy tuna roll rainbow roll spider roll red bean ice cream and green tea mochi ice cream  This was more than enough food for us and we enjoyed it all  Presentation was nice and service was quick and attentive on a busy night  There were lots of Asians there which is always a good sign of authenticity  Food and service was great so will be a place Id return However I did get a very upset stomach that night but it  could be completely unrelated as my husband didnt get sickWe went here on a Saturday night and it was quiet and tranquil Having been to Kanpai several times as well as Sushiya and the terribleyetoverpriced YoSushi Aji beats them all on value and service Its a tasteful casual neighbourhood sushi place with immaculately fresh fish and generous portions Its also BYOB bringing our four rolls and complimentary amuse bouche to just 25 Sushi dinners are affordable now The rainbow roll was gleaming and tasty the spicy salmon had big chunks of salmon not day old fish like some spicy rolls and a tempura sweet potato roll was a humble and surprising star The wait staff were attentive but not intrusive In short this might just be our new date night restaurant  so glad its in the neighbourhoodAji offers something that Edinburgh has needed for quite some time  good reasonablypriced sushi Edinburgh has a small number of good sushi restaurants but most are clustered in the West End and most are relatively expensive The variety of sushi offered is on par with the other good sushi restaurants in the city ie similar to Sushiya but not quite as great as Kanpai My husband and I ordered a range of sushi and maki and found it all to be fresh and wellpresented High points included the octopus nigiri not rubbery as is too often the case spider roll especially generous portion of softshell crab and surprisingly to me the tempura sweet potato roll The latter was indicative of their having made an obvious effort to appeal to vegetarians and meateaters alike by providing a significant number of vegetarian options If there was one minor criticism to be levied it is that the miso soup which in the interest of full disclosure was on the house was a bit too salty What stood out to us above all was the quality  and quantity  offered for price We ordered the amount of sushi that would have usually satisfied us elsewhere and were surprised at the size of the rolls and nigiri We hope very much that should this restaurant become as successful as it deserves to be based on our experience this will not changeWe had no complaints about the service either as both our waitress and the proprietor were friendly and helpful In particular our waitress sensed that we had overordered and asked us if we still wished to get our last portion We gratefully cancelled it as we were stuffed but will definitely be back for more soonFinally as Aji does not yet have a liquor license customers are permitted to bring their own alcohol for the time being  take advantage of this while you canA great sushi place in Edinburgh Sushi restaurants tend to be too expensive for too cheap but Aji hits the nice medium of quality and price I just stumbled upon the restaurant with my friend one day and decided to pop in for dinner Its cash only btw We order the 2 person set meal which is about 35 for 4 courses The first is miso and some tidbits all of which are yummy Then we chose tacoyaki or octopus balls as the second course I normally dont like octopus but that was pretty good 3rd course was sushi with spicy salmon rolls This was great I normally dont like the raw part of sushi and actually eating nigiri but this was nice Although the octopus was a bit dry but for me it worked better The spicy salmon was delicious though a bit too much spicy mayo but the Japanese do like mayoFinally a red dragon roll It was huge and so much food especially since at this point youre super full And eat piece is huge no one could eat the whole thing in your mouth But this too was yummy Its a nice little place that reasonably priced with good quality food I recommend :"

    "review":"Went here with a party of seven and were seated relatively quickly  This place has a fantastic wine selection and a full menu We ordered some delicious appetizers meat plate buratta cheese bruschetta and then turned to entrees  everything was perfectly cooked and just the right portion  The tiramisu and panna cotta didnt last long on the table  Would definitely recommend if youre looking for good Italian foodExcellent Italian restaurant in Edinburgh Old Town You go down stairs for the restaurant and it has an wine cellar feel to it and certain rustic ambiance Food was very good We shared four different types of antipasti dishes I had the Italian sausages for the main which were a tad bit salty The while bean stew with pancetta was filling and delicious Overall good comfort food  High score is for the wine list Ordered s Pinot Nero Pinot noir from Chine which was very good for its priceFabulous food great service great atmosphere and reasonably priced The wine we had was recommended by Peter a fantastic bartender and was delicious we finished an amazing meal with the chocolate and sherry dessert option That was my favourite part YUMWe didnt love the food that much Nice wines though and dessert was very good tooThe thing we didnt enjoy at all was the fact that it took them forever to serve the food They have a very slow service Meanwhile their music list has only a few songs that we had to listen over and over again while we waitedWow this was some find recommended by a good friend Went for dinner recently and can tell its part of the well known Crolla family empire Service is attentive and you feel like being part of the family as options on both food and drink come with a personal recommendation The advice on wines was attentive and somewhat patient I had a very tasty Tuscan bean soup followed by veal Milanese The real attraction though is the stunning collection of wines including my own world favourite from the Bekka Valley in the Lebanon Chateau Musar This was a good 2004 version and such is the investment in this proper enoteca they do this and 11 other wines by the glass dispensed by a very 21st century piece of kit Lovely vault style setup reminded me of many a city of London wine bar without the rampant profusion of secret trists in each corner This is Edinburgh after all Will be back probably with a few more friends and with an eye on the private room which looks perfect for a 1014 strong gathering Oh and the courtyard and fact that it sells cigars will be a major plus through what passes as the summer up hereI arrived on a rainy night with some friends and the soft lighting basement location made for quite the ambiance We enjoyed a wine flight as explained to us patiently by our waiter thereafter we ordered the charcuterie and some sort of a prix fixe menu that made me feel classier than I am In fact the entire place made me feel classier than I am but I suppose a good restaurant should offer that type of experience something unique but attainable Divino Enoteca is fancy but not too fancy its subtle and extremely enjoyable"

    "review":"I was embarrassingly excited the first time I ordered a takeaway from here mainly because of how much I love japanese foodWhich is why it was such a letdown when it arrived eventually It took over an hour which is pretty excessive for a weeknight and especially since they charged for deliveryThat would have been ok if the food had been worth waiting for Im no expert on how to cook Chinese or Japanese food but when you put the hot spring rolls that my flatmate had ordered in with the sashimi in the same box the sashimi has a habit of having started to cook and be lukewarm and rubbery by the time it arrives I dont think Ill ever get a takeaway from here againUgh thats all I can say Im current staring at the nearly full chow mein box on my kitchen table from No1 I had a forkfull and I was doneThe food just tastes bland inside each noodle there is a hint of flavour but its encased in a 2mm thick layer of grease Seriously disappointedI agree with Fiona about the amount of time they take even though it was Saturday night they still took like 25 minutesI dont know what I should do with this tub there is enough oil in here to solve our global energy problem Might give Saudi Arabia a wee phoneContrary to Stuart and Fiona I actually thought this place was okay but just okay  Having said that I went in in person so I cant comment on the speed of delivery  The place feels quite nice inside its also a restaurant so its got nice music playing and pretty stylish decor  The menu seemed bit jumbled up and disorientating as there were so many different dishes some of which with the same description  Eventually I settled on the crispy shredded pork with egg fried rice which took quite a while to be prepared  When I got tucked into it it was certainly crispy even tough  The sauce was quite nice and spicy but the meal as a whole was pretty average  My mate ordered a bag of prawn crackers on the side for his meal and they were somehow soggy  I doubt Ill be going back but I could have just had a substandard experience as the restaurant itself looked quite busyI liked this place but be warned its now closed  I tried to get food here a few days ago but its been turned into a new pizza place that looks quite cool so hopefully their pizza is niceThere are two types of food I am really particular about: Mexican and Chinese I think it has something to do with the fact I am a Californian by birth so I know how amazing both can be This place was a disappointing from the word go but I was so hungry I didnt care The wait staff was rude the food was horrible the decor sucked It was just a giant slice of lose Oh well One less restaurant I have to eat at in EdinburghOK firstly a disclaimer  I cant exactly understand BritishScottish Chinese food i mean HOT CHIPS  WTF  being used to your more authentic Chinese food from Hong Kong I was trying to keep an open mind We had the chicken chow mein beef and black bean egg fried rice and I had the equivalent to mapo tofu pork and tofu spicy Food was good  my Edinburghbornandbred friends said it was really good in quality and taste Yes its not traditional but I dont think thats what theyre aiming for or what the local palate demandsThe tofu dish I did have had small slices of pork in it as opposed to the moretraditional minced pork however Im assuming this is again a regional variation : catering to local expectationsService was fine as were the prawn crackers served before and fortune cookies served after our meal Place was busy with both eatin and take away orders which is always a good signIn short food tasty hot and fresh Service fine Reasonably priced Still dont understand the hot chips at a Chinese restaurant :P"

    "review":"The Clay Oven is an authentic Indian restaurant which serves a fully halal menu  The decor inside is nice and has a kind of enclosed feel which adds to the atmosphere and makes you feel like youre having a proper South Asian experience  The service however is pretty bad I came here with two mates a few months ago and the waiters basically ignored us for for about two minutes when we first came in and then seemed indifferent when were giving them our order for takeaway  I ordered the lamb ramaya  one of their specialities apparantly with rice and a naan  The food seemed to take an eternity to arrive and when it did they just dumped it on the counter and walked off without even acknowledging that it was ours  When we got it back to the flat the food was actually a stark contrast to the service and it tasted pretty good  Im fairly sure I didnt actually get what I ordered but it was still a good mealThe Clay Oven would be an excellent restaurant were it not for the poor service which lets down the whole experience of the placeThe Clay Oven is a delightful Indian restaurant on the busy and bustling Morningside Road in Edinburgh so it is in a great location for students to go to for their lunch or dinner  It is quite small inside but instead of it feeling cramped it feels warm and cosy The decor inside is authentically Indian with Indian music playing in the background The Clay Oven offers a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine on its menu with a good vegetarian choice as well I had the Chicken Pasanda which was on their specialities menu and it was absolutely delicious as it was cooked fresh and the chicken was full of flavour  yum It was very well priced too at under eight pounds and it was a decent size with lots of rice which was also cooked perfectly The Clay Oven also offers set menus which cost around 15 per person and include kebabs nan rice and a desert I found the staff very friendly and accommodating The Clay Oven also serves takeaways which are always cooked very quickly and they now do home deliveries which is incredibly handy if you want a delicious curry an dont want to walk for it  Definitely The Clay Oven is the place I am going to when I next fancy a curryCall me superficial call this trivial but theres just something a little bit special about having a takeaway delivered by a man in a three piece suit This has nothing to do with the quality of the food which is excellent but it definitely brightens up my dayIve been getting takeaways from the Clay Oven for years We as a flat used to get the banquet for two between four of us You get wait for it: Chicken Tikka Massallam Lamb Bhuna Mixed Vegetable Bhaji Alo Gobi Massallam Pilau Rice 2 portions Sultana Nan Kulfi Yeah thats for two people So unless youve a huge appetite this works out at just shy of 6 per person for four 2295 which makes it really good value Otherwise it is one of the more expensive takeawaysTop tip: Ask them to swap the kulfi a sort of weird Indian frozen dessert for another naan Weve never had a problem doing that Unless you really like kulfi you weirdoA few friends and I ordered takeaway from the Clay Oven recently to accompany wine and  theX Factor It was delicious and authentic in the way that only food from an Indian restaurant is as opposed to just a standalone takeaway It took a while to come but was worth the wait and proved to be filling and of excellent quality We had a range of chicken dishes prawn dishes rice and nan breads between us and all were impressive Ill definately make it my local goto for yummy and reliable indian foodOne of many christmas outings this time a work do and I was curious to see what the Clay Oven would be likeFirstly the food is good and plentiful Its like Jenny L said British Indian rather than completely authentic but we had a brilliant buffet mix that satisfied meat eaters and vegetarians The meat dishes were packed full of really great quality meat and there was no stringy fatty bits on the lamb dish we had which I do usually find can be an issueWe were in the back of the restaurant and it would be fair that we did bring our own atmosphere Service was good and staff were helpful but just a bit slow at removing excess bottles and glasses to make way for food which was a wee niggle As this was a buffet Im not sure what dishes we had  a chicken korma I think as the cream and coconuttyalmondy sweetness gives this away sag aloo a mushroom dish the lamb dish and all sorts of naans and pilau rice The naans went down well  I think we had a selection of all types but as Im GF I passed on these though the poppadoms were amongst some of the best Ive ever had :So why not 4 stars Well sitting near the store room I did see prawns in a box obviously being taken down to the kitchen which made me glad we didnt get the Christmas set menu so that put me off a bit But for a group and as long as you are happy to amuse yourselves with some tasty food then yep its worth a visitHoly shashlik kebab batman That was one big plate of food Seriously the most noteworthy thing about this restaurant is the portion sizes and the subsequent delicious food baby that ensuedMy friend and I dined here early one Monday evening  restaurant dead hour As a result it was just us and one other table So ambience was lacking There was also some awful twangy hawaiin inspired Indian music on in the background and it was loud enough that we kept noticing and commenting And last little irk the waiter practically fell over himself insisting we ordered poppadoms Which we really didnt want And had to say NO to several times Luckily he didnt bring them but seriously  I know you make mark up from selling fried air at 40p a pop but I dont want themAnyway the better stuff The food The menu is more British Indian than traditional I appreciate good food in its traditional form and so prefer restaurants that serve up the closest imitation to straightfromthecountry as it can There are other Indians in Edinburgh that do this better But for what it was  British Indian  it seemed okWe both went for the Chicken Shashlik kebab  chicken tandoori with green peppers onions and tomato As we ordered the same thing when it was brought out we assumed the portion in the waiters hand was for both of us to share He proceeded to dish it onto my friends plateand continued serving it ALL until it was gone and reappeared with a fresh sizzling platter of meat for me I regretted ordering the boiled rice as fillerActually thats one other wee thing that irked me I would have preferred if hed set the sizzler down beside us and we had helped ourselves rather than putting it all on our plates at once for us As a result I ate it all but perhaps wouldnt have done had it been on the sizzler A tacticAnyway the chicken itself was a wee bit dry and the yoghurt tandoori marinade a wee bit chalky but the vegetables were quite nice  I liked the tomato  and as far as meals go it was finished and enjoyed Not outlandishsly wonderful by any stretch but for filling Indian fare it hit the spotBut the best part was the price That previously mentioned mountain of sizzling meat set me back 8 The rice and pickles added on bumped it up a wee bit but I didnt touch my rice Value for money it isI think Id rather order takeaway from here than eat in again We were eating in as we were popping into the Dominion for a film after and neither of us expected more than we got for 6pm on a Monday But I think for those nights you need a huge amount of spicy food in front of The Apprentice or Friday night film this could hit the spot Just make sure and say NO poppadoms if youre that way inclined"

    "review":"I was so ignorant about Polish delicacies until my friend brought me here and I can see what all the fuss is about Although most of us may have heard about Polish Vodka in fact we fail to acknowledge their contribution to bakery sweet making and of course dumplings This place boasts a good selection of almost everything including a great meat counter and fresh breadBona Deli is an excellent Polish delicatessen on Clerc Street which has friendly knowledgable service and loads of interesting and rare produce  They sell a huge range of authentic Polish ingredients and delicassies ranging from huge bags of things which look like kettle chips to a whole range of pickled vegetables  Their cured meats section is particularly impressive with a huge selection of smoked hams and cured poultry  Their cheeses are also tempting with many of them looking  and sounding  obscure but also delicious  Bona Deli has an excellent range of food and drink and although its understandably pricy its well worth the extra moneyI have to admit Polish cuisine doesnt exactly excite me all that much but I can honestly say that there are few things I find as tasty as a Kabanos which is absolutely delicious and they have a good selection of them in Bona Deli Bona Deli is an excellent resource if youre looking for some Polish food and I was thrilled to see that they sold Almette which is a really creamy Philadelphia type spread that I ate literally every day on my travels through Eastern Europe  its just so tasty I had a great browse around here the other day and was really intrigued by some of the pickled jars I was also ecstatic to see a wicker basket full of gherkins and I decided to buy a couple to chomp on and they were pickletasticThe Polish delis that have been popping up over the city are each more excellent than the next Someone has set the standard high since most are quite upmarket Bona Deli is no exception  from the minute you step in the door you are faced with delicious bread pastries dumplings Polish confectionery and powers up  the meat counter Polish sausage is an out of this world experience that everyone must try once in their lifeThey have a great selection of booze that doesnt just consist of vodka  there are some very nice Polish beers that I am eager to try There are also some polish branded goods in their convenience store section Lovely and as appreciated by the Scottish as the Polish quarter of Edinburgh Friendly service too Yum yumTraditionally Poland is not recognised for its world class foods  however without a shadow of a doubt it should be if Bona Deli is a taste of what is to comeThe story goes that when the store first opened Polish immigrants who hadnt seen thier home for years would come into the deli to smell the smells of Poland Indeed the smell of fresh Polish bread often greets you as you enter the small deli situated on South Clerk streetBona Deli trades in meats breads speciality Polish vodkas a personal favourite of mine and various other wonders which I am yet to discover  mainly because the packaging is often in Polish something I dont speak at allWhile I could sing the praises of Bona Deli all day it does have a few draw backs  namely the quite expensive prices and how quickly it runs out of its most popular items more than once causing dissapointmentRegardless of this however Bona Deli is a great deli   with real Polish passionHaving just got back from my first trip to Poland I am a little bit obsessed with the cuisine Okay so preparing it at home when the scottish rain is pelting down doesnt even come close to comparing to sitting outside one of the cafs lining the main square in Krakows old town its as close as Im going to get and Bona Deli stocks pretty much every Polish foodstuff there isUnlike most delis they dont feel the need to ridiculously overprice things just because theyre independent  And the value is matched not only by the authenticity but also by the friendly service youll always get a smile and a hello when you go in"

    "review":"Overlooking Portobello Beach stands the Beach House caf Located on the corner of Bath Street this caf offers a wide ranging menu From coffee to pastries sandwiches and salads and cooked breakfasts this caf does it allInside the caf pays homage to its location with deep sea blue walls with various sailing decorations located across the caf Cakes and breads are cooked daily in the caf and one can only admire the smells on offer in the caf It was very busy with families when I paid it a visit and had a great buzzing atmosphere And from reading about it it certainly has won admirers and is one of the best places to go for a bite to eat in the areaWith great views of the beach and the Firth of Forth it really is an ideal location for a caf And even better this caf matches the hype surrounding itPopped in for some tea and scones I like scones you might have noticed after an afternoon on Portobello beach Everything tasted really good and the staff were friendly and helpful The place seems popular with all kinds of people of all ages and the atmosphere was niceI really wanted to like this place Its cute perfect location with a beautiful view of the beach and the decor was nice too And they are serving a lot of organic stuff I was really excited when I walked in but like others mentioned the service was painfully slooooowwwwwww I got there about 11:40am got seated right away but nobody came to take my order until 11:55 and at that time the server refused to take my breakfast order because breakfast was until noon I asked her if she could check with the kitchen and she did but the same answer In my mind I wanted to argue but its 11:55 there is still 5 minutes left But I just didnt want to waste my time anymore If they are ok with having me sit all by myself at the table and go talk to a family who got in after I did  and take their order before me then maybe they just didnt want me there Its unfortunate I really wanted to like this place so that I could come back every morning to get a coffee or breakfast while Im staying in Portobello but I think I would rather spend my money somewhere else where they appreciate my patronageIve been here a few times now as its become a bit of semilocal Good points Location Its on the promenade with views out to the sea Pretty and inviting especially if the weather is a bit lacklustre They also have outdoor seating with blankets for when it gets a bit chilly  Food For the most part is pretty nice The cakes are good and the breakfasts are yum Things to let shall we say work on Staff If you dont want to be in the service industry then dont be The minimum you need as a customer is a smile and just general politeness Ive been here a few times now and it doesnt seem to matter who you get whether sat at a table or grabbing a takeaway you get the feeling that youre just annoying them So so miserable its offputting Im not the only one who feels this way Ive even had people sitting next to us turn to us and comment wondering whether it was just them Portion sizes I cant tell you how small the bacon rolls are And for 395 you would be horrified Which brings me on to the price of thingsI know they have a captured market but its a tad too high You know thinking about it again makes me think I probably wont go back here Ill try the Espy next doorVoici un lieu trs trs agrable proposant des tables de 2 ou des grandes tables  partager Ambiance trs Newport beach bleue et blanc puis bois blanchi Pour ma part tant seule jai bnfici du comptoir devant la fentre face  la mer Je pense que cest lendroit le plus agrable pour savourer un caf et laissant voguer son imagination Le cappuccino est bon et propos en 2 tailles small ou regular le regular est vraiment large Les tarifs sont corrects pour lemplacement environ 3 pour un capuBusy familyoriented caf with below average service I dont want to be too negative about my experience at The Beach House but I have to say for as busy as the place was and it was really crowded inside and out the food and service were not that impressive If you have kids however this must be the best place at Portobello Beach because it seems more geared for people with small children  I stopped in with a couple of friends on a rare sunny day in Edinburgh which definitely means going to Portobello Beach to hang out The inside was completely full with people waiting to get a seat inside We stalked out the outdoor section until someone left and then we quickly sprung into action and snatched up a table for ourselves Upon seeing us our server only gave us two menus and took quite a while to come back and take our orders Clearly they were super busy on this day but we were customers also and deserve to be taken care of The food was fine I had a meat panini and milkshake The food was nothing too special although the mint shake was good Our server never came back after this 30 minutes after eating we had to go inside wait in line for 10 minutes and deal with an overwhelmed cashier who was upset that we split our check and wanted to pay with cards And their card reader wasnt working well either forcing me to try twice before it was successful I hate it when everyone else has a great experience somewhere and I have to review a place and give it a poor review But I have to be honest to other Yelpers out there and be upfront about my personal experiences at place Sorry folks this place didnt cut it for me The wait the poor service the cashier It was all enough together for me to decide that I wont be backOther random observations to note: No alcohol loud inside the caf good selection of cakes"

    "review":"Ive eaten here loads of times in the last couple of years as the chains Tapas for A Tenner deal is not to be sniffed at This branch has though I think ceased offering that This time around our intention was to have the Rapido menu 3 dishes  a drink for 795 but despite being seated before the cut off point of 5pm this was also unavailable Undaunted we went for the cheapest set menu option 1245 per head and managed to not finish it which is I suppose a good sign Wine was reasonably priced too and the only other slightly negative point was the difficulty in attracting attention to get our bill despite the fact there were more than enough staff wandering about the place A continuing favourite thoughI came here once on a date a rather awkward one at that and thought the Spanish decor and warm atmosphere would put me at ease But it didnt The restaurant itself has been decorated in true traditional Spanish style and looks amazing when you first walk in We were shown to our seat   a lovely one in the window   but our table was messy and there was food everywhere I found this odd as there were only 3 other tables in at the time they wernt exactly busyWe ordered a selection of tapas and was impressed at how quickly it came but sadly I wasnt impressed by the food To me Tapas is really exciting and full of flavour but the dishes we had were boring and really rather plain I got the impression it had some straight from the freezerAs a franchise its a nice addition the location is great and the staff are friendly Didnt leave me singing la vida loca howeverReally good food service very good nice atmosphere once it got a bit busier visited on Wednesday evening could be really good for parties large room downstairs Recommend the Sangria CavaUgh  Having lived in Spain for over two years and visited all regions I was excited to find this restaurant in the heart of Edinburgh  Yes the majority of the staff is Spanish but the food is not  Nearly all of the dishes we ordered and we ordered a lot were a poor attempt at recreating Spanish cuisine  If you havent been to the real Spain youll probably think this place is great  If you want real Spanish food youll have to find another place  Id welcome any suggestions  On a side note we brought our toddler here and were given some of the most horrible looks by staff and patrons  The only way youd ever catch me here again was sitting at the bar trying to enjoy Sangria and having real Spanish beer  Dont waste your moneyLa Tasca is always a safe bet for an evening meal Nothing spectacular but decent tapas at good prices Stay away from the fried stuff and go fir the fish dishes although I would recommend the patatas bravasIf you are feeling particularly summery  trashy you should get the sangria I always do :Im a sucker for a deal and was drawn in to La Tasca by a 40 offer despite vague memories of family members warning me that this wasnt a place of good food I let cheapness overrule my brain What a mistake Firstly it was late lunch and there were only a handful of people eating That meant the servers were not exactly swept off their feet but it took a lifetime to take my order  In fact the lady who enticed me off the street happened to wander by and I was able to get my meal ordered then I ordered a selection of vegetarian tapas including patatas bravas and a aubergine and mozzarella dish When it arrived disturbingly quickly it was apparent they all had something in common  a microwave Yup  pre cooked deep fried potato then zapped in some super heater and brought out for your soggy delight The aubergine came out felt at first lukewarm then I discovered it was stone cold in the middle I took a photo to demonstrate the sad presentation I took a scoop out but the tomato sauce dumped on the plate was preserved for its lack of artistic merit servers magically appeared when I took a photo as well I guess it isnt welcomed here to take photos of your foodI tried to get someones attention I failed I looked around Then I got bored and not wanting the rest of my reheated meal to get cold I went to the bar Then I had 3 servers descend on me heavens a diner has left their seat I guess I got the end of the last prepacked aubergine dish as the new plate came out piping hot and equally quickly as the original order So in summary I had a poor imitation of tapas that day with dreadfully slow service saved only by the fact it was super cheap due to the offer on that day I wont return  the fast food nature actually given fast food tends to be cooked fresh Im giving fast food a bad name here of this restaurant makes me think you can do better by going elsewhere"

    "review":"Specialising in mussels oysters and scallops this was the first proper restaurant we headed to an we werent disappointed withour scallop starters and 1kg pots of mussels for mains Yummy Lines out the door during Festival season as no bookings are taken However turnover was pretty quick and we luckily didnt have to wait too longMaybe Im just paranoid but I get really really nervous when Im traveling and wind up eating in tourist central In most cities you really wind up with only two options: Youre either paying through the nose for decent food or paying a smaller amount for nastinessIm happy to say that Mussel Inn didnt veer too far in either direction our mussels were nicely spiced steamed and flavorful with perfectly solid service and a kind front of house that found us a table on a very busy evening And prices were far from unreasonable not cheap but not nearly as horrifying as I expected Made for a satisfying meal downtownwent here for new years eve and it was great  busy but in a good way bustling and fun had the mussels  of course and they were delicious the food was great great bread all of the food was good the inside is a bit like a cafe style rather than posh restaurant but thats what gives it its character loved it and would def go back again every yearMake sure you made reservation before u eat Lol cuz we were gonna have dinner there and we just wentand they told us there is not available seat so we made a reservation for tmr dinner The service is good I ordered a fish as main course and we both ordered a dozen of oyster The oyster is fresh My cousin ordered lobster something and that was deliciousFriendly and welcoming place Good food Mussel is highly recommended very frsh  And its not expensiveThe best seafood restaurant Go here now Definitely in my top 10"

    "review":"Not sure about other meals but brunch here has definitely been an A experience Especially in the midst of a wet and cold winter sometimes all you need is a delicious hearty meal to begin your dayDecided to seek refuge from a brief hailstorm here and ordered the two most appealing things on the menu: banana French toast and corn fritters with halloumi Service was prompt and I was digging into my food like there was no tomorrowFritters were warm and savoury with a great combo of fried halloumi fritters poached egg and beetroot salad on the side French toast was sweet and tasty and the banana  creme fraiche marriage of flavours was good enough to kill for Overall brightened my day up An incredible adorable corner cafe that I would highly recommend to brunch lovers Great price for the value and had a peak at dinner which enticed me to come back for morePS: was preciously called ToastFormerly known as Toast the brunch game here is still as good as it gets All the same delicious foods you enjoyed from Toast like the full breakfasts plus a few new goodies like smoked salmon on a bagel with pickles Great coffee and smoothies Always my favorite place for breakfast in Edinburgh Dont miss it if you are in Marchmont in the morning I also tried their dinner and it was really yummya lamb burger with halloumi followed by a banoffee sundae really hit the spot Since I live close by I will absolutely try it againFirst of all a big thanks to the staff of the Wild Wood Cafe for letting a party of 20ish people take over 90 of your restaurant for a 60th birthday celebration  When we got the invitation we had never heard of Wild Wood but the couple of reviews here helped us feel confident that we were up for a good night out  and we werent disappointedIts a small venue with a small menu but the bright fresh and comfortable atmosphere was matched with welcoming staff who handled our large group with ease  The small menu had all my favourites  and I happily chose we picked in advanced so that helped the staff serve our group pigeon to start followed by duck my husband went for the scallops with black pudding his fave combo and the duck as well  I would have started with the goat cheese and beet root tart but my hubby hates goat cheese and since I wanted to taste his scallops I knew I had to order something I could barter withThe food was fresh nicely presented without being super cheffy and my options combined local ingredients with an asian spice palate  The pigeon and red cabbage had a sweet rich star anise infused sauce slight niggle that I bit into a giant piece of star anise that was hiding in the cabbage  The pigeon was tender and enhanced by the wedges of roasted apples and fragrant braised cabbage  I could have eaten a bowl of the cabbage on its own  I would love to be able to recreate this at home  Actually one of my tests for a good meal is whether I want to try and make it myself and the Wild Wood really delivered on this  Ive recently started making duck breast according to a meal we had in Provenance  I am now moving on and will try to recreate the Wild Wood version  The duck was simply cooked and sliced and accompanied by another asian inspired sauce  But unlike the braised cabbage this was lighter and fresher with hints of ginger and Chinese 5spice  The duck sat on top of a sweet potato rosti again fab  and surprisingly crisp and fresh  not overcooked and mushy    In fact it had more of the texture of grated carrot  A lightly cooked warm salad of rocket and Pak Choi rounded out the plate  and gave me veg cooking envy  There was a small selection of desserts  lacking a chocolate option for me  but luckily we had a birthday cake to satisfy our sweet tooth I am now off to hunt ingredients to try and work out how to recreate their beautifully spiced sauces and vegetables but I have the feeling I may just head back to Wild Wood and let them do the work for me  At a 3 course set price of around 23  Id be foolish not to"

    "review":"My experience here last night pretty much mirrors that of the reviewer from August 2011 As a local Id really rather not pay more during one month of the year just so tourists can have extra cash rung out of them but as Koyama deploy their Festival menu during August that is what happens dont expect any soup other than miso however as the overheads on that dont justify a price increase  its too hard to make in August  you decideFoodwise certainly no complaints but the staff all succumbed to blindness when it came to having us pay the bill despite having brought it down to us We werent the only table to experience this so Id hazard a guess that it occurs regularly A disappointment overall that overshadows the good work being done in the kitchennice taste costeffective the soy sauce is very goodI will bring my friends there next timeMore a 35 star rating if half stars were possible  Took a chance on this place as havent tried it before  There was a lot of nonfish sushi options on the menu and although we primarily go for fish we like trying new rolls  However many had prawn so my options were limited with my shellfish allergy We ordered salmon sashimi 5 pieces a kimchi beef roll a salmon hokkaido roll a softshell crab roll and green tea ice cream and green tea mochi ice cream  The rolls were very chunky which my husband like but I thought was too much rice therefore very filling I was disappointed by the salmon hokkaido roll as it was the salmon nor the mayo sauce were spicy as promised plus the salmon was seared which I didnt expect making the fish more cooked than I prefer  I think this sushi was on the pricier side ranging from 1014 per roll so the final bill was around 55Ive been wanting to try this place ever since it opened Its local to me and its sushi My favourite sushi bars in Edinburgh are quite a trek away so I was excited to see Koyama openingIts big inside and decorated with traditional Japanese artwork It was a cold wet day when my girldate and I arrived and I must admit it was a little cold Felt like there was no heating onThe lunch specials they had were a little pricier than another sushi bar Id been to only by a few  We both went for bento boxes mine with steak and hers with tofu I think mine was around 9 It did state 2 pieces of steak teriyaki but I think I got around 5 or 6 sliced pieces of a bed of onion and beans along with my tuna and salmon maki salad and riceThe salmon and tuna in the maki was perhaps a little small so I really couldnt taste the fish at all But the steak was quite lovely My favourite though was off someone elses plate note: if you ever go eating with me I will try your food The tofu Wow I used to scoff at tofu as it was supplementary for meat and therefore supplementary to meat But after an education in the different types of tofu it appears this was the soft tofu ie: the BEST and was fried and just so soft and melty and the sauce was delicious I was impressedI feel I need to come back here and order sashimi and real sushi to make a fair judgement based on other Edinburgh establishments As all sushi bars in the UK are its pricey for smaller portions Why oh why must it cost 8 for two different types of sashimi that leave me still hungry This isnt specific to Koyama  its all sushi bars in the UKI did notice that their menu didnt have as many sashimi specials or fish sushi specials The bento boxes were slightly limited in options It was nice absolutely but nothing out of the ordinaryAs I said a repeat visit will be required A bit chilly inside but friendly staff and a steaming pot of green tea sorted me out Nice filling lunch although methinks I need to eat raw fish here before I can judge Ill be backIts not that its awful per se But now Ive had more sushi elsewhere I could quite critically look at my platter of tuna and salmon sushi and think hmm I have definitely experienced better And so according to the Yelp star rating two stars it isIts just a kind of imitation of sushi I think the hot dishes like teriyaki are nice and people wont be disappointed if they eat that here or leave hungry But for sushi fiends like myself the slightly dull looking sashimi and messily cut slices of fish atop my nigiri and very thick rolls of seaweed around a maki that had no taste and the fartoolargelygrated pieces of carrot on the side it was all quite subparThe service is friendly very friendly and it does always pain me to give lower ratings to places that evidently mean well I did eat it all it was edible but considering it was 10 for my platter of sushi and it really wasnt even as good as the Pret a Manger or Marks and Spencers prepackaged ones I wont be coming back any time soon Im afraidFor nonfussy nonSushi eaters the hot dishes would be aok but there are far better sushi places in town to drop another crispy tenner note hereLongest and tastiest Dragon roll Ive ever had Basic interior but comfy and relaxedService was quite slow  especially odd as it wasnt busyReally fresh salmon for the nigiri good value Only took 1 star away because the rice for the nigiri and maki fell apart as we tried to pick it up A big surprise was the Pumpkin Croquette  it was virtually identical to my favourite itm from Yo  the pumpkin Korroke  Maybe they both buy them from the same supplier  if so can I have the address please so I can stock my freezer"

    "review":"This is one for when youre not in a hurry Service can be a bit slow but its worth the wait for all the different cuts off meat You cant order anything specific but its great for trying lots of different things The salad bar isnt anything spectacular but is a nice accompaniment to the meat which is really the star of the showThis place sells itself as the authentic Brazilian churrasco place but in my opinion it is only inspired on this type of restaurants  The salad bar is pretty much the same you would find in most UK restaurants and the barbecue did not live up to my expectations That being said the restaurant is cozy and the service was good For the carnivores out there you could definitely eat a lot of meat there but I recommend you be selective on which offers you accept The highlights of the night were the Picanha and the Lamb One more thing they do not take AMEX I had to pull out my VISA cardArmed with a voucher we decided that that was a great excuse to try some Brazilian food Especially on a dreary day in October we were in need of some warming food and atmosphere First of the location it is right opposite the EICC on Morrison Street We tried to find a place to have some pre drinks  which was not possible as there is nothing close to this restaurant Not their fault obviously but it would have been nice  The entrance is on first impression on the outside is eh Purple on the inside you are forgiven to think you stepped into a 1990s IKEA canteen They have the entrance section close to the buffet and churrascaria grilling station The voucher meals are in 2 sittings between 68pm and 810pm  we had the formerWe were explained how it works: you go to the buffet select salads sauces rice fries etc that you can take to your table The staff will come round with various stacks of meat Sausages chicken lamb pork chicken hearts Parmesan pork beef from the rib rump steak honey glazed gammon and possible moreThe buffet had the usual varieties of salad olives peppers beetroot and warm rice dishes stroganoff hey they must have loads of leftovers meat that could not be carved anymore so not too surprising I was pleased with the condiments  good harissa like chili paste was my favouritein order to protect yourself from a meat overdose and inefficient meat offerings from the staff you are provided with a disk One side RED the other side GREENWhen you turn the disk to green you indicate to the meatbarer that you are open for that offering Red obviously means not now or eventually finished it is a good system We took the advise from former visitors that reviewed it and did not overdo the buffet nor the first offerings of meat it was rewarded with a few nice cuts of medium rare rump and some succulent honey gammon nearer the end of the sitting We did notice that the skin tougher parts were always offered first After a while I caught on and asked for more succulent parts to be cut  as I am the the one eating it I like my cuts to be pleasant Finished off with a couple of Brahmas Brazilian Beer we were proper fullWould I go back possibly when asked but not seeking it out as a special visit Their perceived tactics of fill em up before the nicer meats come out is a little too obvious The price I paid on the voucher was just about worth itI do like the starters they r tasty However it has very limited choice Only 4 starters if Im not wrongThe MEAT I must say I am bit disappointed with it they do have a large range of roasted meats but u cant expect too much on the taste some of them r overcooked even burned  some of them r too salty I only find the sweet pork and beef rib r nice Average waiting time between each roast coming is far too long we were like wait there and have nothing to eat the staffs r nice thoughWe dont have a voucher so its like 20 quids pp which is bit overvalued given the quality of meat however if u r a meat lover with a discount voucher  its certainly wonderful place for ur nights outI had my reservations about this place going in admittedly its in a pretty random area Id not heard of anyone going to it or really seen it full when I walked past But my family booked us a table so off we wentWe were seated in a little room which was tucked away from the rest of the place Quite a nice thing when the stag do came in ten minutes after us Confusingly we were given 2 drinks menus each with some similar and some different wines And then the waitress again told us they had different wines to EITHER or those This didnt really give a great service vibe for me but onwards The concept is  self serve salad bar meat brought to you The salad bar isnt bad  I appreciated the presence of fejoada which was traditional and yummy Otherwise a blog standard supermarket salad bar  not much excitementThe meat was better than expected  a few cuts of the chicken were dry though one was saved by being wrapped in bacon mmmm but the interior of the beef cuts were pretty delicious and rare Just when we thought we were full the waitress made sure we got the best of the night  pineapple glazed gammon with cinnamon sugar grilled pineapple for after THIS was the standout  the meat was juicy sweet and salty and the pineapple an excellent palate cleanserAll in all not bad  a solid option for big groups of people or those who value meat in quantity on a budget For me personally it wasnt worth the price tag and I dont think Ill be rushing backI agree wholeheartedly with Sharon Gs assessment I havent been lucky to visit the ones in Brazil but Viva Brazil and Tropeiro in Glasgow are mighty impressive This place seriously suffers by comparison with them The salad bar is no good although we had better luck on the meat front with the chicken hearts proving quite entertaining little morselsWhat I hope is the case is that this is the first of many churrascaria places that open in Edinburgh as its a style of dining that I really enjoy Fingers crossedOverall we said: the meat on offer at Zicos was very tasty The salad bar was rather disappointing so those with a previous acquaintance with the churrascaria experience wont be blown away by this place But Im glad that Edinburgh now has one of these and imagine well get another few appearing in the next few months Very well suited to group dining this place will do just fine and has a solid opportunity to improve from a good starting point"

    "review":"Read an article in the NYT and was lucky enough to fly with a friend who made a reservation As a flight attendant who travels all around the world I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I have ever had They ask if you have any food allergies which is a nice touch and then bring out an amuse bouche which includes the scottish national dish haggis but its deep fried and delicious  I had the seared scallops as an appetizer and the salmon over sword fish risotto and a vanilla beurre blanc Melts in your mouthThey deal predominantly in seafood but there were other options available Make reservations as it only seats 27 at a time  well worth itMake an effort to try this place David and Andrew were especially nice I look forward to visiting againYay another promising restaurant just opened in Stockbridge The Kilted Lobster is a friendly little place where Karens Unicorn used to be This week they are doing a very reasonablypriced set menu with meat fish and vegetarian options I hear an a la carte menu is coming soon The glutenfree diner at our table was graciously accommodatedI had the brie rumbledethumps to start disappointing despite the awesome name followed by the gnocchi as a main delicious The assortment of amuse bouches was very tasty as was the dessert plateThe wines by the glass are good value as wellId wandered past Kilted Lobster the past weekend and was surprised to see a new restaurant opening along the quieter end of st stephen street  i probably would have completely forgotten about the place to be honest but when it was a suggested dinner venue for the book club i was happy enough to go alongnow its hard to give the most accurate review as we dined on a set menu and they have just launched their a la carte menu today  i think the set menu was more as a trial of different dishes for the first week they were open as i note that there are the same dishes on their a la carte menu with just slight variations  however the set menu was incredibly good value 1495 for three courses and a platter of amuse bouche to start off with  i should also note that their wine menu is superb value with the majority of the larger glasses being either just above or below the 4 markthe amuse bouche was brought to us shortly after we ordered and was quite nice  it was three different bites goats cheese with tomatopepper salsa i think on ciabatta ham hock and chicken liver pate on oatcake with rosemary and smoked makerel pate on a cucumber slice  they werent overly imaginative but a nice little treat to start the meal  my starter was the brie rumbledethup which i would describe as a cross between a bubble and squeak or a croquette  it was ok and i was a bit disappointed that the brie was all in the centre instead of mixed throughout  it was served on a tree trunk section which i found super odd and would have really preferred a plate  main course was pistachio crusted roast coley with a smoked haddock croquette broccoli and lemon cream sauce  i found this more enjoyable than the starter especially as the fish was cooked really well compared to a filet of coley id had somewhere else last week and the croquette was super tasty  id actually recommend that they make that a starter option over the rumbledethup  dessert was a platter to be shared between us which was just ok prosecco and strawberry jelly chocolate mousse and a cheesecake square  im not a massive jelly fan and found the other two options just ok really  the chocolate mousse was probably the nicest but it was served in a fancy glass that narrowed at the bottom so you couldnt get your spoon all the way down to finish it offive rather mixed feelings on the Kilted Lobster as there were some really nice parts of the meal  i ended up paying 20 for three courses a large glass of wine and tip so definitely value friendly although that may change with their a la carte menu  the service was good although there was only one girl waiting tables so could imagine that may be a struggle if it got busy  i feel like they could be onto a good thing here and would definitely head back to try the a la carte menu to see if i could up my ratingand just as a side note to all those health and safety minded people the landing with steps down to the toilets is incredibly tiny and if you happened to not be paying attention theres definitely a potential of falling down the stairs  id advise they put up a wee sign warning people just to avoid any accidents :Really liked Kilted Lobster Nice little addition to Stockbridge and good for gluten free and special diet options which is lovelyCame here with some fellow Yelpers in their soft opening period prior to the formal launch We had a taster menu of 3 courses and amuse bouche As the gluten free one I received my own little selection which was appreciatedMy starter was a terrine which was tasty but for me my stellar stand out dish was the pork belly This was cooked to absolute perfection with melt in the mouth pork belly and crispy crunchy crackling which was to die for One of the elements of this dish was black pudding which was swapped out My version came with apples gravy and potatoes which was all just fab togetherDessert was a platter with chocolate pots jelly and I got some fruit too my gfness and all were greatWine  decent options and cheap too Service was attentive and friendly Being picky I thought my plate for the main was too big plate size not portion as I thought it didnt do the dish justice Ill definitely go back to try more from the menu as the options look so temptingIts almost like the closer you live to a place the longer it takes to actually check it out But alas I can finally say Ive been  So lets cut to it It wasok As you all already know from reading all my reviews I like to talk about my experience from beginning to end So firstly the Kilted Lobster is small As in you can hear every conversation happening over lunch or dinner and if you feel so inclined you could just lean over and add your two cents So you know if you want an intimate and romantic time just be mindful that everyone in the restaurant can hear you Service was great Our server was extremely friendly often checking up on us during our meal which led to some back and forth conversation which sometimes can get a big much The food was nice Obviously its all about seafood here and I cant fault the effort they put into it To start my partner and I shared the mussels which was more than enough for two Very tasty and served with some bread the sauce was delicious and quickly quite filling For our mains: the half lobster and the cod with a vanilla buerreblanc and grilled asparagus Both beautifully presented and thats what I mean The effort is there Unfortunately the flavour is not My cod was beautifully cooked though underseasoned and the buerreblanc was so vanillaey its a word now it was almost like eating fish with an extremely thick vanilla custard I would have liked a bit more citrus to brighten the dish as it was quite heavy overall My favorite part was the grilled asparagus since it was tasty and well seasoned I would go back to give it another crack This is a business where you can tell they have put their heart and soul into it and the effort is there it just needs to be executed better Im going to put this down to a new local business trying to find its feet and hope it does just get better over time Still reccomended and these guys seem to be winning awards all over the place at the moment They also accept referrals for underprivileged families to come and dine in the restaurant so despite my meal experience they have my total respect for their sense of community and social justice"

    "review":"Lovely grand barn of a pub with a really nice comfortable feel and plenty of places to sit Relaxed atmosphere alsoI didnt eat here but instead popped in for a drink on a Friday night The place was busy at first as they were showing football on their big screen TV As a bar it was standard My major gripe however was the lack of tablesseats A large empty restaurant in the back and nowhere to sit downstairs or on the narrow mezzanine upstairs Its a fine place to visit but nothing Id personally write home aboutFraser is the most amazing host He helped us match our drinks with the dinner we ordered We are from California and this is an amazing spot to check out Fraser was able to make our experience amazing This was out honeymoon and our hotel was close by we came here almost every night for food or drinksYeah well its just a bit MEH Nice interior lots of rustic timber and stone good location right on the Shore front overlooking the boats and a decent drink selection  But the staff arent all that friendly and the food well dont bother  I work down at the Shore and wanted to like this place because it is so handy but it just does not floating my boat  Ive eaten here 3 times I gave them a few chances hoping it would get better but the quality of food was either coldluke warm cheap or poor quality  The menu is uninspiring and standard pub grub nothing to get excited about  Its a shame because if they improved the menu and standards this place could be really buzzin  They have a small gigfunction space upstairs they even hold poll dancing classes up there a mezzanine level for diners and cosy armchairs at the front In the summer they open the full height windows onto the street prefect for a sitting in the sun with an ice cool pint  They often host live acoustic sets next to the fire place from WednesdaysFridays too  So they are getting there I last visited in November 2013 but in recent news on the 21st December 2013 just before Christmas a blaze ripped through their kitchen forcing customers and staff to be evacuated  Luckily there were no casualties but the fire spread to the roof and it took around 30 firefighters extinguish the blaze  The kitchen is currently getting repaired and we are yet to hear when they will be reopening for food I do hope they improve the food quality at the same timeNot impressed The reviews werent too great so v hesitant to try it but I gave it a go I ordered their soup of the day and found the soup to be bland and found a piece of tooth pick in it to top it off I decided not to give my main a go so canceled that The drinks maybe go but didnt come in for that Wouldnt recommend it for foodLeckeres Essen tolle CocktailsLustige und zuvorkommende BedienungAngenehme Einrichtung an dem Abend auch mit LiveMusikWrde wieder hingehen"

    "review":"What a great idea Get a huge roasted porker and sit him in the window for all to see heid and all Then serve up big shredded portions of him on a bun with a choice or combination of sage and onion apple sauce or sweet chilli relish Additionally you can get some crackling for an extra 50p or so Brilliant Im deducting 1 star for the fact that you cant get a nice cold beer to wash it down Otherwise no complaints from meMy husband has been looking forward to having a meal here for several months It was one of the first things he mentioned after we got off the train at Waverly Station and it kept creeping into conversation as the days in Edinburgh swept on byWe finally had a chance to give it a try the day before we were set to leave for Prague We each got the The Oink  which is a regularsized version of the sandwich I chose to dress my brown roll with sage and onion and the chili relish while my husband chose the apple sauce and chili relish on a white rollThey are cash only and their dining room is almost nonexistent so if theyre busy you may have to take your sandwich to go As it was the one table by the window was taken and the one bar area with four chairs was also taken We were just discussing where we could go to eat when the guys at the bar offered us their seats as they were finishing upThe sandwich was good but I wasnt blown away by it I guess I had built it up in my head so much over the months  we talked about it we drooled over the pictures  so I was expecting it to knock me on my bumIt was decent and it filled me up Plus it was by far the cheapest meal we had on the entire trip so that has to count for somethingWhat a great concept With the whole hog presented in the window its real as fresh and honest as it gets I tried the kids sandwich with their most popular sauce and it was worth every pound I cant wait to come back and get it again Worth the tripI came here on a weekday night with a friend and it was semipacked The shop isnt too big so there wasnt much seating but its a nice and cozy place I got a classic white roll with apple sauce which was recommended to me and I thought was weird upon ordering But it was delicious The apple sauce had a nice balance with the meat There was so much meat in the sandwich though I wish there were more sauce and more vegetables The pork was pretty good and flavorful although I think my sandwich was too big Towards the end of eating it I no longer wanted to eat it because there was too much meat Good place to try out thoughWith apple sauce and haggis this was a very good sandwich I only wish I could have sat somewhere to eat itI will certainly go back next time I am in town :I thought it was just okay my husband would have probably given 4 stars I got the oink with onion stuffing with applesauce and I thought it was pretty bland About half way through I asked for another sauce to spice it up a bit and they said itd cost an extra 1 I think thats silly because the menu says choose your relishes  Plural And wouldnt you want your guests to enjoy their food Well in return Ill write this review so I guess were even :Meh it was ok I wouldnt recommend it to others but it was fine"

    "review":"Have you wanted to get out of the City but you dont have a car and cant be bothered with buses           Head towards the famous hill of Edinburgh Arthurs Seat You can climb it if you want it does have spectacular views from the top and provides the feeling of self accomplishment However you can also walk around it and head towards the village of Duddingston There are a variety of routes to reach the village either following the road  from which you will get to see Duddingston Loch or under via the Innocent Cycle Path or even over Arthurs SeatOnce you arrive at the village head towards the famous Sheeps Heid Inn the oldest public House of Scotland from 1360 It was thought to be the stopping place for travellers and royalty going between Holyrood and Craigmillar Castle Here you will find a good selection of beers and ales and other drinks much needed after the walk as well as food The pub is like a treasure trove with various memorabilia left from previous visitorsso take your time to have a look aroundI surely did as well as board games you are welcome to use  There is also a cute beer garden in the back if you are lucky with the weather and do not miss out on taking a look at the old skittle alley ask a member of staff to let you in if you cant find it Skittles is like an early form of bowling and the Inn is quite popular for it so it is usually hard to book a slot There is a large variety of food to choose from from tourist favourites of haggis and other Scottish delicacies to lighter options On Sundays there is also a roast which tends to get quite popular call to book in advance and around spring and the summer there are various barbeques and beer festivals check their website for more details: http:wwwsheepheidcoukhistoryhtml Prices are on the verge of affordable but one is really visiting this place for its ambience I always take visiting friends here as a sort of outing Although the food can be quite stodgy and heavy I would highly recommend this place to any visitor or resident of Edinburgh who wants to let go of the city and get a feel of an authentic puba cosy place whatever the weather may beOh My Goodness I loved this place It was so cozy and I loved the history of the place Our tour guide a Scottish native told us it was a must see and he was right Its supposedly the oldest pub in Scotland I ordered the Paddington Bear drink because I am a bit of a wuss when it comes to alcohol but it was delicious My husband has a whisky and we all left stuffed The courtyard out back has games and people were actually playing and having a good laugh at themselves I would have joined in but after the amazing meal I needed a napThis pub that claims  to be the oldest in Edinburgh  was a disappointment  The food was average and no different from any other pub in the area  Our group consisted of two couples one of which was a well known political figure One would have thought we wouldve been given at least decent service  The service was slow and the server indifferent  The worst part of the evening was when one of the people in our group asked to take home to her pooch the remaining pork that she could not finish   ie  doggy bag   The server said that is was the policy of this pub to not allow any carryout of food not consumed in the pub  She said they did not have the items needed to wrap up items  ie foil plastic wrap   Really  Or was it just that the server could not be bothered We would never return to this pub again under any circumstances  Hard to believe it is the oldest pub and it has lasted as long as it claimThis is a great place to come for food we had seafood platter and it was wonderful Super place to relax and the bottle of white wine was nice too So if you want and lovely meal come here The staff where very friendly and nice Nach einem anstrengenden Tag in Edinburgh ein perfekter Ort fr eine Mahlzeit Das Essen ist perfekt sehr lecker nicht zu teuer und der Service ist sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich Die Whiskyauswahl ist fr einen normalen Pub gut Absolut empfehlenswertWe had gone to the Sheep Heid Inn for my birthday and work leaving do on a Tuesday night We made reservations for dinner and skittles and had a big table in the corner Waitress came took our orderwe got a free bottle of champagne sign up to their newsletter for the birthday coupon But an hour later we call our waitress who in that time had not come to check on us or offer more drinks even though people seated long after us had been served their meals and we had a visibly pregnant woman with us Turns out that our order never went through Needless to say we were very disappointed in the waitress and the quality of service she seriously didnt even seem to care Cant believe that no one noticed esp as it was a quiet Tuesday We ended up getting the food 15 hrs after ordering drinks However management comped us use of the skittles alley the ambiance of the inn and alley were nice and my food got the steak was pretty good and reasonably priced Skittles was a wonderful timedefinitely recommend it Its a bit out of the way from Edinburgh central Nicolson St in terms of buses but a lovely 05 hr walk around the park Good if you like historic pubs and want to experience skittles"

    "review":"Sportsters is one of those bars which is desperately trying to be like those American sports bars you see in the movies They have TV screens everywhere at every angle so you wont miss a second of the football Because that is pretty much what this place is a place to watch the football with your mates while having a pint and something to eat Its definitely a lads lad sort of place Im not really a football fan so this doesnt really appeal to me but if you like to watch sport then this place is ideal Heck they even have TV screens in the booths That is pretty impressive methinks I quite like the food here The portions are massive and its great for a big group to have lunch at Its the type of menu you would expect from a bar but it is done quite well I enjoy the Caesar Salad and they used to do this massive sharing dessert which was basically a huge bowl of ice cream marshmallows chocolate and sauce Im not 100 sure if they still do it I find the drinks to be quite expensive which means I wont go for a night out hereBig pay per view sporting events such as boxing are what these places specialise in Hosting a ridiculously large amount of viewing screens and neat little booths to pile you and your chums into Sportsters is a good choice for the sports enthusiast  By no means would I recommend this place for anything other than watching a sporting event and sipping a beer you wouldnt come here for a quiet drink put it that way I recently watched the David Haye Vs John Ruiz fight here and considering the place was packed I never missed a second of the action or a decibel of the commentaryTo be honest I only ever really used to come to Sportsters because its attached to City nightclub which I used to frequent every Wednesday evening a wee while back Ok truthfully not a wee while back about four years ago when I was still living a carefree life of reckless abandon as a studentMy friends and I found that queuing up for Sportsters and getting into City nightclub through this devious route was easier than waiting in the often mile long queue that used to snake down Market Street for entry into the main club So therein lies my experience of Sportsters However I do have something useful to tell you about this expansive shiny bar The clue is in the name and if you have any sports match game or tournament you desire to watch here you have guaranteed screens for your viewing delight in every available space plus you can get food and cheap beverages to go with itIm not really into sports  you would know that if you ever saw my hips  but Sportsters is a playground for those who are Ive been here for a few big events most recently the Superbowl It has a great atmosphere and is always busy if theres a big event onI went with my ex boyfriend and his football team so we got in free but they were charging 7 at the door  crazyWhenever there is a sporting event everyone gets really into it here And during the breaks there is a playstation at each table  cool One of the good things about Sportsters is they have small screens on each table so when you cant see the big screen properly you have your own personal oneTheir food is ok too  we had nachos and there were a bit scarce with the cheese the best bit in my opinionmaybe that explains the hipsThis seems to be the place of choice for those who are into two things Sports games and heavy drinkingBeing into only one of those two things guess which one I was semireluctant to go to a place called Sportsters There was a football match on that my mates wanted to see and I had agreed to go and watch it with them My overall opinion was this place does only one thing well  the sports its clearly how this place survives by providing such a range of sports and many boothstelevisions to watch it in Everything else seems somewhat below par   the food and the bar staff especiallyDespite that I had a good timee  but that might have been the heavy drinking side of thingsSportsters is the ideal place to come to watch just about any major sporting event whilst enjoying some moderately priced drinks  They show anything on their large screens from American football to rugby league and theres plenty of comfortable seating to spectate it from  Although being sports orientated it is still a good pub to come and enjoy a drink with friends even if the match is of only peripheral importance  The reason I havent given it five stars is because it is a bit of a lads lad sort of place and I know a lot of girls who moan about it because their male companions spend the evening openmouthed and staring at the screensAs a member of Edinburgh Uni rugby club we have our own VIP room upstairs which we use every Wednesday and Saturday nights after the matches before heading out  Here we get pints for about 180 and the staff are also good enough to serve us hot food  The bar staff are extremely tolerant of us and Ive never had a bad evening in Sportsters"

    "review":"We were staying at the Fraser Suites Hotel which is great so we thought this restaurant would be great too We came about 30 minutes before their breakfast ends We decided to do their breakfast buffet When we got to the food table there were hardly any food left We started with what they have at the moment thinking they would replenish the almost empty containers on the table We waited but they did not We asked and the only answer we got is sorry no We ended up scavenging the food containers for whatever food we can get which is just horrible after we paid about 12 pounds each And whatever food we got they were not great They should have not offered us the breakfast buffet if they knew they willnot replenish the food We would have just ordered food from the menu The interior is nice though but you cant eat it Youd rather go to places like Worlds End Rabbie Burns and many other places that serves breakfast than eat here Youll get your moneys worth elsewhereFour of us dined on a Sunday evening and left satisfied on the whole We started with a fish sharing board which included mackerel salmon and I believe trout along with eggplant slices and other vegetables Very good starter My date has this thing about haggis  he has toured all around the UK and tries it wherever its offered The verdict was a decent haggis which I tasted off the bucket list I had the chicken wrapped in Parma ham  dry was my overall impression Salads were goodThe alcohol solution was pretty positive Innis and Gunn in the bottle a nice brew indeed Also very nice scotch Glenkinchie was the special  loved itThe service was polite but a little disorganizedI was surprised that two reviews were one star It was not a total disaster like the other reviewers wrote perhaps theyve upped their game in the meantime  there was something good for everyoneafternoon tea is a bit of a british insitution and a lovely wee treat for a girls get together at the weekend a group of six of us had bought an itison deal for a cocktail and the traditional afternoon tea delights  so we made a book and a windy saturday afternoon in january we went alongon first entering the restaurant it all looks very nice  Broadsheet Bistro is part of the fraser suites just off the royal mile  the decor is a chic townhouse sort of look but very luxurious  the staff were pleasant and once we were all seated set about making our cocktails after taking our order for teahowever after that it all went a bit downhill  cocktails arrived and i think they were supposed to be a cosmopolitan but it mainly just tasted like cranberry juice  in fact im not actually convinced that there was alcohol in the drink at all  next the afternoon tea began to arrive  there was a plate with skewers of little triangle sandwiches and the traditional three tier stand with cakes and scones  the sandwiches were ok but the bread was a bit stale so not great  and the cakes store bought doughnuts and a poorly made strawberry tart which was really just a tart base with some whipped cream messily spooned in and topped with a strawberry  the scones were warmed but clearly not homemade eitherif id paid for this afternoon tea i would have been sorely disappointed  thankfully my friend and i got the deal for free since three other people bought it off her link  its a real shame as the staff were lovely and the restaurant itself quite nice  but the food was a serious let down and maybe something they should look at resolving before offering any further dealsFor those who dont feel like reading a long review: One of the WORST dining experiences that I have had anywhere in the world  AVOID AT ALL COSTSMy family and I came here after taking a highland tour which offered a discount coupon for the Broadsheet Bistro  We arrived at 7pm on a Friday eveningOur first warning should have been the fact that the place was completely empty except for a man and his young daughter who were eating dinner  The interior was nice but they had loud club music playing an an inappropriate volume  It was so distracting that we actually asked them to turn it offOur waitress was impossibly inept: Either she was paralyzed by nervousness or did not speak a word of English as all four of us had to repeat our orders multiple times  She was unable to answer any questions that we had about the menu as she genuinely did not understand what we were saying  The question: Does this come with any vegetable or salad left her speechless and stuttering out a request for clarification which in turn had to be twice repeated  In addition to the food we ordered drinks two glasses of wine and a beer  Our waitress returned to state that they did not have one type of wine that was ordered nor the beer  We reordered  She returned again to say that actually they only had one type of wine and one type of beer in stock  When my entree arrived  the pasta with broccoli and cheddar  it was the least inspiring dish that I have ever laid eyes on  Imagine putting just those three ingredients  half a cup of pasta three pieces of broccoli and a bit of shredded orange cheddar  in a bowl and then microwaving it  That was my meal for the lovely price of 15Two of us ordered the apple cobbler in an attempt to end the meal on a sweet note  The filling could have come out of a can the cobbler top was not cooked in the least and was actually a liquid dough  Disgusting  I didnt go back for more after my first awful biteAs the icing on this putrid cake the manager claimed that the restaurant had changed hands a week ago and that he could not honour our coupon  This after we had to complain about the music our waitress and our drinks  Poor poor showMy sister and myself came here for an afternoon tea which she had kindly bought for me through a Groupon deal  The venue itself looks lovely and we had a great time catching up had i not been gifted the experience though i dont think I would be backThe staff in here are to their credit lovely Very attentive and friendly and offering us free refills throughout Its a shame the quality of what they offer lets them down Cosmopolitans that tasted like straight cranberry juice and were a deep blood red color Be horrified cocktail purists Similarly the cakes and morsels on offer weremeh Shop bought mini donuts shop bought strawberry tarts and scones which could easily have been from Greggs  but at least came toasted and with creamAll in all not a horrifying experience by any means Just not mind blowing or even that great they could do so much more with their lovely spaceI feel the 2 stars a little harsh but i can see their pointthe cosmopolitian was a tasty but Im thinking now where was the alcohol  As stated the tart was nice but on the cheap end of any tart  The donuts were tasty but are there tradiotional for afternoon tea or a quick cheap substitute for the voucher  Now  Its not all negatives before you switch off  The teacoffee is on tap so we could drink as much as we could  The sandwiches were nice Tasty but could do with more filling considering we asked for NO EGG may0 or an extra sandwich of the other one  I think the scone was highlight as it was nice and fluffy and oh yeah WARM  Although the cream was not proper clotted cream but squeezy creamOk ok  Im not to sure what to expect when you buy a voucher but  If you want good word of mouth you need to provide a little more dazzle  Of the recent yelp reviews this is clearly not the caseIve been dazzled with afternoon teas else where so wouldnt rush back here"

    "review":"Im never quite sure why I have walked past this place and seen queues out the door  I really dont like RudisNot only does the whole queue thing allude to how slow the service really is  I think snails can be trained to do it quicker  but it is generally an off putting experience of being crammed into such a small deli with so many peopleHaving waited for so long once you have reached the front of the queue you will be starving  but there is a problem There is such a small choice of sandwich fillingsother options that it wouldnt suprise me if you didnt see anything you fancied at all Really other places around here have so many more things on offer Prices are also shamelessly expensive and overall the food really isnt that great at allAs I said I really dont understand this place doing so wellAlthough the Rudi logo is worthy of being printed on a tshirt their deli selection is not as attractiveTheres nothing particularly bad about Rudi deli: the sandwichesbaguettes are all freshly made and taste ok and they do a particularly good foccacia but on the whole its nothing specialRidiculous queues due to sluggish service is a factor that taints my overall picture of Rudi and the prices wont leave you satisfied either As a result I often rule out Rudi for a lunchtime snackSimply AOK only just thoughTheres a reason this place runs out of sandwiches by late lunch time sometimes earlier if the day is sunny I have been there early enough  to see that they do make a lot of them in the morning Its a takeaway sandwich bar with really fresh and tasty sandwiches  Its Italian so dont expect complicated sauces etc just pure fresh ingredients and good combinations of salamis tomatoes mozzarella salads etc The Meadows are a stones throw away so when the sun is out grab your food and head there for a picnic Unlike other yelpers I actually really like Rudis and his sandwiches It reminds me a bit of home : the sandwiches are there and ready if you want something with a million sauces and fillings then there is a subway down the street for you If you want small changes or some particular combination with the ingredients on offer the guy is always happy to make it so long as it is not panic time in the shopFrom my experience of Rudis Ive always found it to be pleasant inside with a great range of food and in particular breads  The queues are usually painful around lunchtime and they could easily do with some more staff in there  The vast majority of people come for their excellent sandwiches which are sold cheaply and do for a great lunch  I usually go for one of their seeded brown baguettes with some smoked ham and salad  They have a great range of cooked meats cheeses olives and fresh salad  The service isnt the quickest but theyre always friendly make your sandwich exactly as you ask for itWith Baguette Express up opposite Greggs up the road alongside subway Rudis is competing for lunch time trade but always wins for me You can get the usual combinations on a selection of different breads but Im always drawn to the premade gourmet sandwiches at the counter Options are more diverse than in the other chain sandwich shops and my personal favourite was jarlsberg ham salad and basil mayo on a rosemary and thyme foccacia Completely pretentious sounding Ill give you that but Ill take one of those over a limp ham salad baguette from across the road any day And despite the premium products you dont have to pay premium pricesI dont know if I have been in this little cafe at a better time than the reviewers but I loved itRudis is as delightful on the inside as it is on its outside It has a cute appealing signage and even more appealing light bites on the menu It is very much Italian snacky with ciabatta and focaccia being the food of choice But thatll sort you out if youre starving since its a healthy carb fest filled with delicious topping optionsThere are a load of delis littered around Edinburgh but this little business is in my opinion one of the better ones Its affordable and fresh And if youre unlucky enough to miss the sandwiches after the lunchtime rush at least you can still grab a cup of lip lickingly good coffee Lovely"

    "review":"Papa Johns  A welcome relief from the mould of chain pizza delivery services that we are often subjected to Papa Johns quite frankly is delicious Once youve tried their pizza youll rarely look again to Dominoes or Pizza Hut Delivery  They boast that their dough is 100 fresh and much to my surprise you CAN actually taste the difference The range of toppings is wide and cater to all sorts of tastes ranging from the classic pepperoni to the more traditional Italian influenced toppings such as goats cheese and caramelised peppers   A particular highlight for me is the Chicken BBQ pizza a blissful infusion  of chargrilled chicken bacon onions and barbecue sauceHowever be prepared to pay a little extra for the quality Without taking advantage of the various offers available including frequent offers of any pizza any size for 999 upon collection prices can seem a little steep Yet students in possession of a snapfax can rejoice with a fantastic 40 discount upon collection or 20 discount with delivery There are plenty side dishes and desserts available for those aiming to bring in a little variation to their takeaway pizza experience including chicken wings cheesecakes and Ben and Jerrys ice cream Overall perhaps a bit more expensive but certainly worth it due to the superior taste over the competitionPapa Johns is one of those takeaways that youre going to visit at least once if youre a student in Edinburgh  Helped by having a prominent location on South Clerk Street I always see student types in here when I walk pastSince I moved away from the area I have nearly forgotten about the Papa Johns goodness  I tend to default now to using Pizza Hut for delivery  purely because I enjoy their restaurants  As Callum rightly says their pizzas are not the cheapest in the world but they definitely come up to the bar in the taste stakes  Papa Johns then becomes another good reason to get yourself a SnapfaxIve lost count of the amount of times I walk past here and get lured towards this place by the aroma of fresh pizza  Its a wonder I dont spend a lot more time here  Great pizza that when combined with a DVD from Blockbusters opposite is a recipe for a top night inWith so many Dominos loyalists out there Ive got to take a stand for Papa Johns and say they serve awesome pizza as well These two stores are quite competitively located on the same street ie NicolsonClerkwhatever you want to call it street This pizza place is DEFINITELY geared towards delivery as their attempt at seating includes two benches facing each other in reception Funny enough I believe Ive eaten pizza there on more than one occasion anyway I think Im just always impressed by large sized pizzas and from what Ive personally had over there I would recommend the hawain bbq chicken and vegetarian pizzas I wont scrutinize the quality of their dough cheese and the like because in my opinion ALOT of these pizzas taste the same to me granted theyre equally delicious but unless theyre made in a wood oven by an actual italian who has spoilt all pizzas for me since what is there to say reallyPepperoniSpicy minceChilli cheese slicesJalapenosExtra jalapenosFull rectal prolapseIf thats not the best way to spend a Friday night I really dont know what isTheres a reason why Papa Johns is one of the leading pizza chains and even though it pains many to admit it its because their pizzas are pretty good  The bases are thin and crisp whilst the toppings are always generous moist and delicious  Their prices arent cheap though as a decent sized one will usually cost you at least a tenner  They make up for this by often having deals on like two for one which make it perfect for getting a quick and easy meal with friends  They also hand out plenty of vouchers to students which attracts evermore custom  They have a great selection of toppings and their meat feast in particular is amazing  Papa Johns offers great pizzas and quick service  always a winnerMy favourite pizza delivery in Edinburgh The pizzas are so much better than the other big chains  Pizza Hut or Dominoes as their pizzas are more grown up without silly toppings gimmicks or sugary sauce The one time they were late with my order they gave me the pizzas for free a 15 credit for a future order and most importantly  a sincere apology"

    "review":"You can usually identify the quality of a Pizza by its tomato base The Italian Connection of which Im sure food passionate Italians would insist there isnt slaps its sugary mass produced artificial tomato base on all its pizzas  This ultimately taints all the pizzas they serve Saying that the pizzas are cheap and I often see people inside on a regular basis Let me know if Im missing somethingThe only connection they have is to the Italian Section in Asda This place is disappointing But that doesnt stop hundreds of people visiting every time I pass Ive never seen the place empty I dont know whats doing on For me Im with Sam the pizza tastes very manufactured its got no heart which is strange as hell to say Im giving this a 3 star because I realise this a popular place Might not be for meI only went to Italian Connection once and Ill probably never go back  Judging by the fact that it has Italian in its name I was expecting authentic pasta dises and speciality pizzas but as far as I could see it was just an average takeaway which did a bit of pasta on the side  It mostly sells pizzas which to be fair are quite cheap at about 45 each but I wouldnt have even said that they were worth that  I ordered a pepperoni with pineapple which actually looked pretty good when they handed it to me  Despite this the whole thing just tasted dry and tough and the cheese was obviously just standard processed stuff  In its favour however the service is quick and friendly and seem to zap the surprisingly large queues pretty quickly  As I said Im not really a fan but plenty of people seem to be so give it a try and see what you thinkI was pretty disappointed with my meal at Italian Connection Located in the centre of the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh Italian Connection should be the Italian place that every student living in the area goes to for their lunch or dinner but it is rather disappointing The place does not look much from the outside and the food is not up to much either Italian Connection primarily sells pizzas which are very well priced as they are a decent size and most of them cost under 5 depending on what toppings you choose and a ten inch Margarita costs 350 I ordered a pizza with green peppers onions and olives and although the topping of the pizza was tasty with lots of cheese the base was really hard and pretty burnt I have not returned to the Italian Connection since but every time I walk by in the evenings it is always fairly busy inside which I am quite surprised about but perhaps by burnt base was a oneoff Italian Connections pizzas are for takeaways and they also do home deliverys within a 23 mile radius of the shop which is handy if you live further away from the place and dont want to walkWe had a great experience here with a delivery to cure yet another seasonal hangover We went for a veg pizza a few sides and some juice Standard prices for such items and delivery was quickThe pizza we received was piping hot and looked the part Everyone enjoyed what they had and for a take away this was a good effort The sides were better than your average pizza place  All in it wasnt our culinary highlight of the Christmas period but for what it is it was great Thumbs up from me and I will definitely be backI have a long and complicated relationship with Italian Connection which like one of the other reviewers has now come to an end I for my part have no regretsMy wife grew up in Edinburgh and has ordered pizza from Italian Connection for years I moved here in 2009 and after trying a few places we settled on Italian Connection as our regular pizza delivery place because their pizzas were good with interesting toppings and plenty of them The drawback with them was that they have always taken an incredibly long time to deliver Our first flat when we moved here was approximately ten minutes walk away from Italian Connection Our current flat is maybe 15 minutes walk away Despite this they would routinely take an hour or more to deliver a pizza We got used to ordering from them long before we were actually hungry You may ask why we didnt order for pickup rather than delivery The fact is they offered delivery and as the parents of young kids it wasnt always convenient or even possible for us to pick up the pizzas On the one occasion I did order for pickup I was told to come in 20 minutes after placing the order I did so On arriving I waited another 25 minutes before my pizzas were ready I say all this to show that Im not some ignorant curmudgeon who just thinks that restaurants and takeaways should be able to deliver exactly what you want instantly I am able to make pizza It takes hours you have to wait for the dough to rise and you have to make the sauce etc etc But I also know that unlike me in my kitchen a proper pizza restaurant has already done all those things and that with a proper pizza oven it only takes about 510 minutes to actually cook a pizza I recognise that takeaways have delivery systems and queues that can delay delivery I also know that my favourite Chinese takeaway can deliver me an order of six different dishes within 30 minutes whereas it can take Italian Connection which is closer to where I live than the Chinese takeaway an hour or more to deliver two simple pizzas The other night I ordered a pizza for myself and was told it would take between 45 minutes and hour to be delivered Im used to that with them so I waited It finally arrived 90 minutes later and was brutally overcooked to the point of being barely edible the crust was biscuitlike and the cheese was dark brown all over In spite of that tonight my wife and I ordered two pizzas at 822pm I told them on ordering that the last time Id ordered my pizza had been way overcooked and had taken a very long time to arrive I was told that they had a new manager and was promised that this time it would be done just right and would arrive promptlyAt 945pm I rang to ask where my pizza was I overheard the phone operator asking where my pizza was and being told Two minutes I was then told it would be there in two minutesAt 10pm I rang to ask where my pizza was I was told it was on its way Five minutes later it arrived It was clearly freshly cooked The delivery guy asked how I was I said Hungry He said What about me I havent eaten anything all day I did not point out to him that that was not my problemThe pizzas had barely any topping on them certainly not as much as they used to have I can only assume that Italian Connection deferred cooking my pizzas for some reason and then decided to punish me for complaining about them by putting the bare minimum of topping on them Italian Connection claims to have a new manager All I can say is they may have hired someone new but whoever he or she is he or she is not a manager I will never order from them again"

    "review":"Freshly refurbished Kalpna is once again open for business after being closed for what seemed like an ageThis place which has always been a vegetarian restaurant used to be a great place to come to get food  whether it was a large group who were looking for something abit different or just you and a friend looking for some quiet time Kalpna could provideNow however it has taken on a new role  it still tries to be the place where you can go for good vegetarian Indian food but some of its sparkle has gone and really Im not sure what it is The whole place just doesnt seem welcoming and its abit too modern for my likingHowever the food still remains great and as ever the staff are friendly so iots not like everything has gone down hill I will be back here although I might just have to put up with the new decor and general atmosphereOur restaurant experience was very good To keep it simple the service was great and the wait staff was able to accommodate us on New Years Eve It took us a bit to find but when we got there the place was decorated well and had a good ambiance Food was decent especially since they were accommodating an onion garlic allergy Lassis and desserts were delicious I would definitely recommend checking this place out during your trip to Edinburgh It is also highly rated amongst the vegetarian reviewers Have a nice cup of tea to end the nightOur restaurant experience was very good To keep it simple the service was great and the wait staff was able to accommodate us on New Years Eve It took us a bit to find but when we got there the place was decorated well and had a good ambiance Food was decent especially since they were accommodating an onion garlic allergy Lassis and desserts were delicious I would definitely recommend checking this place out during your trip to Edinburgh It is also highly rated amongst the vegetarian reviewers Have a nice cup of tea to end the night and I would highly recommend the authentic matka kulfiWhen traveling travelers want to eat something familiar and they usually turn to their native cuisine or fast food While in Edinburgh I opted for the former Being of Indian origin I was looking for an Indian restaurant hearing rave reviews about Kalpna from the hotel reception staff I decided it was worth a try The restaurant is nice with a casual ambience that very much reminds diners of the cuisine thats cooked within with thoughtful Indian decoration The waitstaff were polite and helpful but not overbearing The star of the show however was the food the first day we tried the Archana Thali and Thali Raj Bhog which didnt disappoint Being delighted with the experience we visited once again this time however we sampled the Tandoori Mix starter which consisted of several vegetables and Panner being roasted in the Tandoor We then ate Dal Tadka Bhindi Bhaji and Dum Aloo along with Tandoori Roti Garlic Naan and Chapati All dishes were very tasty and enjoyable However the Dum Aloo while tasty was unlike the Dum Aloo I have ever eaten before My only gripe with the place are the restrooms while sufficiently neat they are located underground beneath the dining room and are not lit very well this has sort of an eerie effect and makes it seem a shady place quite unlike the rest of the restaurant To conclude if you want a good authentic Indian experience go to Kalpna you cant go wrongSuper delicious Indian  Ive had it all over the world but this was the best  Definitely get the Mateer paneer the peas were fresh  The coconut rice was insanely delicious  The main thing we noticed was that we werent overwhelmed by the spices the vegetables themselves were the stars  We even has desserts and they were all perfect not overly sweet Even if youre not vegetarian dont miss this foodIf youre vegetarian this place is well worth the visit Carnivores like myself will find limited options but they are still very tasty The garlic naan was excellent Service was a bit slow but not terrible"

    "review":"With its swanky lago clean and crisp interior and the odd incense stick burning away on the counter The Curry Leaf is a refreshing alternative to your usual takeaway curry Out of ideas and with little patience to cook for myself Ive opted for The Curry Leafs classic lamb rogan josh on many occasion followed by their light and fluffy naan breadsThe classic dishes are inexpensive and with a home delivery service I see no reason to claim that The Curry Leaf offers everything you could possibly want from a Indian takeaway service Top stuffMy flatmates and I was first made aware of The Curry Leaf when they posted a flyer with their menu under the door of our flat  It literally sat there on the doormat for about two months until one night in December whilst in the throes of exams we decided to order a curry  Their menu is extensive offering chicken beef or lamb in a wide variety of sauces and all for more or less the same price  Further they serve vegetable curries for only about 450  I ordered the lamb balti with plain rice and a shawermah naan  In total and including delivery it came to 40 between four of us which seemed like a lot but it was delicious and we were absolutely stuffed by the end of it  We even had left overs to put in the fridge for lunch the next day My only criticism is that the shawermah naans turned out to be just plain despite us paying extra for themRegardless however The Curry Leaf serves excellent food at reasonable prices and is definitely worth a visit for a late night Indian feastStarted just over a year ago Curry Leaf is one of the most upscale Indian takeouts Ive been to in Edinburgh Its owned by a friendly guy called Riaz pictured with his very friendly pose Its located in the peaceful area of Bruntsfield and is the only one of its kind that Im aware of in the area Strictly a take out business theres not even the pretence of a table or two and from the semilong wait and cooking sounds I could make out in the background the foods freshly made and it tastes that way It was a friends delicious meal of Chicken Bhuna and Peshwari Naan that led me there I suppose I have simple tastes but Im more enchanted by this naan than anything else: it has coconut in it Definitely a great side to the meal which also didnt disappoint The rest of the menu is quite extensive and is very fancily worded Its more expensive than your typical takeout but once you take a look at the menu and the dcor youll figure out whyIm a huge fan of the food to this day but their customer service has suffered greatly in the last 18 months I could list many occasions when their customer service has failed me but I think one will suffice: the last 2 times Ive ordered from the Curry Leaf the gentleman delivering the food has been extremely rude when not provided with a tip sneering Thats very kind of you sir I wont rush next timeFor the record while I tip in restaurants and bars without fail I dont tip delivery guys but I dont expect to be lambasted for itI will not be ordering from the Curry Leaf againNo Cure for Common ColdI wanted a really spicy curry to clear me of the dangers of the imminent cold I felt coming on and was driving home from work through Bruntsfield Knowing very little about the curry houses of brunters I took pot luck at this placeIts a well presented take away which was part of the allure and I had heard about them before The menu was relatively standard and I chose a Jalfrezi as I know this is a standard safe bet spicy number Garlic Naan and a couple side dishes  yes I know I am a pigSo firstly flavour levels were low particularly in the curry naan was fine and sides were a complete nonevent Secondly there was next to no spice in this curry now I know the brits apparently cant handle spice but I can and was bitterly disappointed at the lack of effort hereSeriously take my advice and dont waste your timeHoocha wawa  My takeaway heaven Fresh simple and hot The curry leaf in Bruntsfield is so unlike the standard takeaware fare that it deserves its own yellow pages category  I dont stray too much up and down the menu these days sticking with the gourmet jalfresi and a brace of chapati Its damn hot but gets those endorphins screaming  Whats more its licensed to sell beer so youre never going to get caught out at home sucking an ice cube and crying like a baby when youve chewed through a chilli Portions are big but probably match the price Im not a huge fan of the ricethe first couple of times I ordered i felt I had to have it but I think its better with a couple of chapatti nowIm going to keep on coming back until my chilli gland shrivels and dies and leaves me to korma hell"

    "review":"Has Mammas changed ownership recently Got a delivery at the weekend and the first thing I noticed was that it arrived in a generic box as opposed to a Mammas box What was inside was just as generic and soggy and nothing like the Mammas pizzas I remember from the past On the phone I was asked if I wanted spicy or mild but that didnt seem to translate to much on the plate They may as well have asked if I wanted bland or blander As for the Buffalo wings coated in Mammas secret spicy recipe and served with your choice of sauces I think they may have waived a some BBQ sauce nearby but three of the wings didnt even have any sauce on them If they were coated in some secret spicy recipe I think the secret will be safe for a while I used to like Mammas but will probably be taking my custom elsewhere in future The one star is for the quick deliveryGood for casual quick food in the Grassmarket They dont have a full menu of pizza options but rather a dozen options and then a list of all the toppings you can put together in any combination you want This is not so good for indecisive people like me as it gives me too many possibilities The pizzas are good and come in a variety of sizes the ruler on the back of the menu is especially usefully The tables are very close together so expect your neighbouring tables to be able to overhear your conversation and you to be able to overhear theirsThey do gluten free pizzas and beer which are apparently awesome according to my gluten free friendReally good pizza I had gluten free pizza that was amazing my friends said their regular pizza was good as well Free wifi and nice staff :Our waitress was an awesome Irish girl She brought the wifi password to us without even asking which was AWESOME for people who want to connect back home She was very niceSooooooo so so so so good I cant stop saying OMG Its the best meal that I ever tried in ukThis Italian restaurant at the Grassmarket was worryingly empty when a friend and I walked up to it it was good weather and wed just spent a lovely hour lunching and lounging at Made in Italy All the outdoor seats of the restaurants and pubs we walked past were full except for Mammas However we did check out the menu which is definitely unique Youve the option of truly creating your own pizza with banana and Danish blue cheese amongst the choice of toppings Their pricy mains such as seared steak you can cook yourself on a hot stone original and Cajun salmon may have contributed to the empty seats which really does puzzle me because the menu looked awesome So awesome Ill upload a picture"

    "review":"This restaurant was very nice and I enjoyed the meal the prices are not too expensive and the portions were decently sized the chicken bbq wings and classic burger which I had were very nice and the only problem we had with the meal were the undercooked chips staff were nice and the meal took about 15 minutes to be served good choice of drinks recommend itAs I couldnt decide on what I wanted to eat I ordered two starters  the nachos and the quesadillas  Priced 3 each its not bad what you receive just nothing that wow either  The nachos were tasty at first but got less appealing at the end and not really my kinda nacho  the quesadillas were feta  sweet potato and was lacking in seasoning  Ive been to this place many years ago as a kid probably on a birthday night out And didnt have any quiffs about it thats cause I was a kid and probably not as clued up on food as I know I call myself a food snob generally cause its true  BUT I give the chains a try and in the case I may not come back as its just wasnt my cup o tea But with certain friends I may have to compromise on coming back as they are not food snobs  Staff were on the go and really helpful so not fault thereWho would have ever thought to try Mexican food in Scotland Me thats whoVery nice place and location with plenty of parking The menu seemed endless and yet some of the things were odd to us Not sure where they derived their version of Mexican food from but whatever might as well try it Popcorn as a starter instead of chips and salsa Um ok Never seen that before I tried the fajitas and they were served and tasted like every other Mexican place Ive eaten Family had the loaded nachos and complained about the soggy chips within Someone needs to remember to NOT pour runny salsa over tortilla chips if serving as nachos Other than that the pricing was fair and comparable to other places Not my favorite but Id probably go backOur server Eden was awesome and had a thick Scottish accent Very nice and affable but I literally had to ask her to slow down when speaking because of the loud atmosphere in the restaurant She took my joking about her accent in stride and we had a good laugh about the stupid American who gave her a blank stare when she spokeI recommend this place if you cant find better elsewhereI must admit I was slightly disappointed in Chiquito The restaurant is decorated very nicely with lots of little Mexican objects dotted around everywhere but when it came to food it kind of fell flatI had a beef burger with chips and when it came it occupied a very small portion of the plate and the burger was clearly frozen The chips were oven chips obviously The chips had far too much seasoning on them for my liking and were too herbyIt was a very hot day when we visited and the AC wasnt working the restaurant was packed and since there is little lighting in the place it felt quite claustrophobic as if we were being packed into the place like sardines in a canThe toilets were probably the best thing about the whole thing They were clean spacious and played traditional Mexican music Not to mention that the walls were decorated with a desertThe burger was pretty pricey as well I think it was 1195 I could have gone next door to Five Guys and gotten the same thing but at a cheaper price and a larger portion I dont think I will be returning to Chiquito"

    "review":"I came across this place by accident on a Sunday a morning a few months ago rushing about and just needing a coffee I think that Ive gone to it every weekday morning since then The owner is a gifted pastry chief and I enjoy them every now and again but what really strikes me is the care that he puts into everything including my morning americano He makes that coffee with the same intent that he makes his tartes like its a high end chemistry experimentThe food is also great  ask about the fig and sweet potato soup On top of it all the owner  who is always there  has endless amounts of enthusiasm for what he is doing Id probably drop in just for that aloneSouthern Belgian French inspired cafeThe charming owner is ever so sincere in preparation of all menu items inclusive of the many delectable pastries  cakes on display  This is an amazing one man show where he is the jack of all trades in every part of running the cafe  The ample care he puts in does show  Cappuccino waffles chocolate cake average four stars me :  I usually go the savoury route for breakfast a full scottish or eggs benedict kind of gal  But it was hard to deny such a cheerful recommendation so that was that  The waffle batter was a good homemade one non of that perfectly shaped processed nonsense  What impressed me were the ever so fresh seasonal berries and fruits carefully selected and cut for an impeccable presentation  Coffee was better than good the man knows how to do a cappuccino  Chocolate cake was scrumptious  The slight quirk in decoration paired well with the cozy home away from home feel  One of a kind genuine fellow who knows how to keep customers comingRun by a Belgian pastry chef Cafe Bleu is an interesting new addition to our collection of Edinburgh cafesTheir specialities are freshly prepared savoury and sweet tartes but they also showcase some unusual soup combinations sweet potato and peanut butter anyone I stopped in for breakfast and was served a lovely plate of smoked salmon and eggsId recommend you pop in particularly if youre a fan of pastry treatsSo overall we said: I found Cafe Bleu to be a really charming little place Another relative newcomer its challenge is to get the message out about its existence as its in a slightly betwixt and between location Hopefully this review will help as I think its a place thats well worthy of your attention"

    "review":"I think Amy is right becauseThis is a really great chippy food is really cheap and so are cans too thats where they sting you But like she said dont expect to get served on a Saturday The best you can hope for is sitting around collecting the scraps on the ground what the punters drop which could feed a small countryI think Amy is wrong becauseBaked beans should never be near sausage suppers and she should be banished to an Spooky Island for even suggesting itthis could be the best fish and chips in gorgieslateford area shame they dont have cod but only haddock and I personally dont like haddock nevertheless the fish is freshly cooked and chips r generally crispy I was bit confused about price since I ordered the fish and chips and battered sausage supper which cost me about ten quid something I think thats bit expensiveThis is my local chippy and its pretty good The staff are pretty friendly and they serve a variety of chip shop food They also do pizzas which are good enough and there is a varied selection of toppings My boyfriend always gets the fish and it does taste pretty good The food is always freshly made too theres nothing more disappointing than getting your fish supper home only to discover its cold and soggyThis chippy is right next to Tynecastle stadium and when there is a match on this place is packed So I guess they are doing something right As far as I can see its the only decent chip shop in the area One thing that bugs me is they dont do baked beans Random I know but I like beans with my sausage supper I guess in Edinburgh baked beans at the chippy is a nonoGorgie Fish bar right by Tynecastle Stadium has got it all as far as Im concerned Theres a fair bit of space inside and a massive heated counter where a good supply of fish and chips can be kept for the starving punters who come in their throngs on match daysYes it does the standard kind of food youd expect from a chippy  namely fish and chips But as Amy said they are done exceptionally well You can smell the deep fried goodness as you walk on by Its aroma is wafted across Gorgie Road and you are powerless to resist its tempting charmChips are crispy and tasty as hell without being rubbish and overcooked portions are generous and staff are patient even on the busiest of days Service is pretty good considering its always busy and the fact that its usually stowed out is a testament to how popular it is amongst the locals Its big its deep fried and its here to stayIm going to give Gorgie Fish Bar 3 stars Not because it doesnt do GF chippys but because my chips this time were awesome but absolutely bloody awful last time hence 18 months between visitsMy comments are strictly chip related for the special dietary needs exclaimer above but all sorts are available here  pizzas suppers of every variety burgers glass bottle juices jars of mussels etcMy chips this time were perfect Post the Odyssey night and after a couple of glasses of Prosecco I had an almighty craving for chips on my walk home They were freshly made piping hot not too greasy and when I asked for my usual they were drowned in tons and tons of salt and vinegar I scoffed them quickly they were so goodService is great here  it is the one place where if I say tons of salt and vinegar then they get a proper heart attack inducing level of salt pouring and a drowning of vinegar  yum :So Im more inclined to visit again soon and if the same high standards are met then it may even be a 4 or 5 review for the humble bag of chipsPS its a decent sized portion too :"

    "review":"I havent been to Embo deli in a while but thinking about their delicious wraps and sarnies makes me want to go right now Offering a sit in option in fresh modern surroundings or take away if youre in a bit of a rush Embo is a great place to grab breakfast lunch or just a quick snackThe menu is devilishly good making it hard to make a decision of what to go for They have an excellent selection of sandwiches and wraps with so many fresh delicious fillings to choose from In addition to this they also offer soups antipasti and an excellent vegetarian range including my favourite Baba Ganoush  The prices are reasonable and the staff have always been friendly on my visits whether Ive been sitting in or taking away An excellent choice if youre looking for a bite to eat in the area Thumbs upIm a fan for sureI popped in here for a takeaway lynx before a hair cut and it was mmm mmm tasty deliciousI opted for a Mexican chicken wrap Deliciously full of zesty light fresh tomato salsa deep dreamy guacamole and juicy chicken pieces Turned out to be one of the finest Ive had in a long time I followed it up with some kinda of Czech sponge and caramel cake not too dry not too sweet lovely with a coffee probably I had diet coke for shame I knowI didnt stick around a long time to fully appreciate the cafe itself but its spacious but kinda homely with big wooden furniture and little nicknaks around the place And a big robot by the front door As you doI found myself thinking it was a little 690 for a smallish wrap smallish cake bottle of juice But actually it was damn tasty so actually pretty good value I think Consider this a recommendationEmbo didnt float my boat It has a lot of competition from nearby places particularly on Broughton Street that offer higher quality for less money so it isnt on my list of places for a repeat visitOverall we said: Embo didnt quite hit the mark for me I like their ideas but the balance of the dishes isnt quite there and I dont think that the quality on offer justifies the significantly higher pricetag than some of the similar offerings from their near neighbours It strikes me more as a place to sitin for a relaxing hour the side salad that comes with their wraps when you sitin looked quite impressive rather than grab a quick takeoutStopped by Embo for lunch recently and was not disappointed Its a no frills kind of place a bit basic on the creature comforts but it more than makes up for it with delicious food and super nice staffI have had both the Mexican wrap and the crayfish salad Ingredients were fresh and portions generous for the price and both times a great marriage of flavours The Mexican wrap better than some Mexican places in town Cant really say more than that Its good honest tasty food at a good price I look forward to returningNote to anyone who is reading this and thinking I have never heardseen this place before check it out I ended up here after a wee stroll round town this Saturday afternoon now this place does have only a few seats so I wasnt expecting to get one but I got a lovely stool by the window to watch the world go byMain reason I am rating this place the salads YUMMERS I had a hot smoked trout crayfish creme fraiche and salsa salad man alive was it heaven for my belly Plus they are not stingy with the fish which I was half expecting as it was only a fiver which seemed very reasonable Another reason everywhere these days seems to do paninis not that I have anything against that whatsoever but it was nice to see something different Instead of your usual toasted panini they do toasted wraps with a selection that sound devine And I would imagine you can mix it up a little and choose your own Service was good friendly and efficient Nice interesting interior free newspapers and they have a specials board always a bonus I already have my eye on a toasted wrap with parma ham mozzarella and pesto for next timeEmbo is my standard lunch option when I am uninspired by anywhere else it is a short walk from my flat and on a sunny day the few tables outside are in a great wee sun trap where you can watch the often colourful characters of Leith walk wander by The owner goes out of his way to please and never without a smile  I am always interested to see what local artist is showing their work in the cafe and if they took card payment I may have spent a small fortune by now :I highly recommend the halloumi  chorizo salad  drools  So give it a go and tell him you read about wee Embo on the interweb hell be wellimpressed :D  EnjoyIndependentEdinburgh"

    "review":"Got these guys to make me a club sandwich even though it isnt on the menu I like pushing my luck and they were more than happy to accommodate me There wasnt any room for me to sit down inside and the seats were wet from the rain shower earlier in the day so I decided to eat it on the bus homeless styleI could have sworn they left the bread out in the rainstorm it was wetter than a sponge I could only eat a few bites then I had to throw it away It was a shame because the filling was beautifulBroke my wee heartQupi cafe is a cosy unusual little cafe situated in the part of Leith that is a bit devoid of cultural offerings sorry it has to be saidSo this place shines out like a wee gem Always crowded but not overrun the constant custom stands as a testament to how popular Qupi is amongst locals and passers by It sells some delicious Greek food not to mention the usual cafe and afternoon tea offerings Food is served up piping hot and brimming with goodnessThere is definitely a rustic but also continental feel to this cafe and I got the impression everything in here was homemade on the day since it was so fresh For the quality of the food the prices are surprisingly low The staff are very friendly attentive and sharp so youre not lingering about waiting to be served for ages On the contrary I felt well looked afterThis is the kind of place I delight in bringing a book to and setting myself up for an afternoon of reading No matter how busy it is there is something relaxed about this homely quirky cafe and it has a charming appeal that will see me coming back next time Im in this neck of the woodsThe sheer amount of times I have passed this place on the bus and wondered how to correctly pronounce the name is the main reason one day I got off the bus and threw cautuon to the wind and headed into Qupi The cafe itself is a little bit on the shabby side and very small The food is an eclectic mix of greek and traditional cafe fare Im not sure that this combination works together but judging by the sheer number of people who passed in and out of the doors as I sat eating goes to show that some people must really appreciate this place The staff were friendly and very efficiant managing to get through customers like a machine gun through tissue paper Rather impressiveAs for the pronunciation of the name Im still not sureExcellent little cafe with as another reviewer put it a continental feel Nice array of sandwiches platters and cakes on offer Nice breakfasts and very decent coffee Cosy inside with a quirky but comfortable dcor and very friendly service Ive been twice and each time I had one of their generous baguettes filled with hummus or feta and olives A tasty side vegetable salad featuring beets and a simple dressing came with it The baguettes are  delish and good value for money This was no skimpy sandwich Give it a tryAmazing coffee Art exhibitions in the back room Fantastic service and the food is great Brilliant little place Would highly recommendThis is cool little Greek Cafe and I have to say that the food was sooo delicious We had 2 sharing platters  Yes we are fatties One was a a mix of hummus Aubergine salad bread  the other with bread Pork  friesit was just lovely The girls who served us were very friendly and i particularly loved the cafe decor it had a fun ecletic mix of chairs at the back zebra  leopard printIt also had some interesting masks on the wall and an array of hats hanging from the ceiling Not expensive and the only reason i am not awarding it 5 stars is because i felt cold the front of the cafe is much warmerGo visit if you are in the Leith area :"

    "review":"I live dangerously close to Central Takeaway and frequently go there for my lunch or dinner several times a week  When I first saw Central I assumed it was a fish and chip shop but it has a wide menu   It serves pizzas pasta dishes and burgers as well as the other traditional chip shop type food such as battered sausages  The food tastes delicious and the chips are some of the best I have tasted  It is fairly reasonably priced with a fish supper just under 6  The staff are friendly and always seem to remember which sauces I like on my chips  clearly a sign I have been there far too much  It stays open till the early morning so it is an ideal place to stop by on your back from a night out to grab a bag of chips  In addition to it being a takeaway Central also has a few indoor tables and chairs for people to eat insideCentral is on everyones way home from a night out By everyone I mean everyone who lives in Marchmont Bruntsfield and Morningside It seems my world is really quite small if you think of it Anyway its standard Youve got your range of pizzas which are actually pretty tasty for how incredibly cheap they are your chips with cheese chips without cheese chips with your uniquely and kinda bizarre Scottish chip sauce I really have no idea what they put in it Theres also your range of deepfried unappetisinglooking sausages and blood sausages and fish I only say unappetising because the thought of deepfrying everything kinda gives me miniature hypochondriac heart attacks This may be an exaggeration They will deepfry your pizza at request Yes Your pizza I may have been living here for a while now but I still just dont get it They also serve the strangest of desserts Well strangest Ive ever encountered anyway: Scotlands best Deepfried Mars bars Theyre a force to be reckoned with So if you find you cant quite walk straight and should probably line your stomach with grease Central is a decent cheap optionI got chips here once and I enjoyed it Kind of your run of the mill chippie I wouldnt go out of my way to recommend it but if you have a craving for chips and youre there why notThe Central Chippy is a fantastic family run chippy just south of the city centre Its perfectly located for picking up a bag of chips or homemade pizza on your way home from a sunny day spent in the Meadows or a night spent in a sweaty club The lunchtime deals are pretty good and you can pick up a slice and some chips for only a couple of quid I always ask for extra chippy sauce something I advise you try but only Edinburgh people seem to truely love it This is one of the few establishments where the food tastes as good at 2pm as it does at 2amAverage chippie but is a well above average locationOnly ever tried their Suppers never their pizza which are nice but nothing to write home about What really sells this place is its location as has been mentioned before its on the way home to a lot of Edinburgh and in my case by car back to GlasgowCost wise it is quite reasonableNothing beats going to a cool chippie like this at 2am after a great night out and having a fried pizza summer I miss living in Scotland for that meal alone My waist thanks me though There is nothing better than that greasy crispy taste of a fried pizza BOSS"

    "review":"This pub is definitely owned by people who are integrated into their community and understand what their customers many of whom are students want  As soon as you walk in it feel clean and well organised and on the walls there are plenty of adverts for events including charity auctions and and a weekly jog on Tuesdays at 7pm to a place called Sofis and back again  Im not entirely sure why they do this but it apparantly attracts quite a crowdApart from this the drinks are well priced and the service is friendly and effective  The food is proper gastropub stuff with posh poached eggs on ciabatta toast and a wide selection of crepes  I had a smoked salmon sandwich with salad which cost 5  This seems a lot but it was a good portion which provided a filling meal in itself  Joseph Pearce does excellent business and you only have to visit once to understand whyThis place is most certainly a shining example of a pub giving its customers mostly students and young professionals what they want If you could imagine a pub that knows its clientel and aims to keep them  its Joseph PearceThe food is splendid and while may seem over priced it is actually good value for money  not only does it taste great there are some whopping portions as well The decor is relaxed and stylish while the staff are friendly and welcoming Drinks are a tad on the expensivce side but there is a large selection and you always get the good stuff when you ask for a spirit and mixerI like this place a lot but I guess thats exactly what Joseph Pearce is trying to make me feelLong live the swedesThats the general vibe of this restaurantbar which was bought over by a Swedish couple a few years ago Having lived in Sweden for two years I noticed the sign outside advertising Swedish cider Many restaurants offer that these days but once you step in you cant miss the large Swedish flag and paraphernalia on the wallsThe menu is a clever mix of Swedish pancakes cured salmon and a smorgasbord and some more general European dishes such as Barcelona salad and tiger prawns with gazpacho Jonathan Pearce is quite large and the rooms near the rear are very nicely decorated They hold several theme events throughout the year and my friend and I are anxious to go to an all day barbecue there this weekendSo I guess this place is SWEDISH  Had no idea until I tried ordering the bratwurstUh that comes on a bun rightA whatA bun  You know BREADOh no  It comes on a saladThen Ill have the hamburger with cheese That comes on a bun rightIt comes on a salad  This is a Swedish restaurantOf course Ill have the JP SmorgasbordGood choice  The variety plate was chock full of tastiness and the Gravad Lax salad Joe ordered was out of this world  Not the cheapest lunch Ive enjoyed here in Edinburgh but a light and delicious meal shared with friends on the outdoor patio under the shiniest sun weve seen in this side of the Atlantic  Very friendly service to bootI came in here for a coffee and something to eat having infrequently enjoyed some of the companys other efforts: Sofis and Bar Boda The space feels lovely and airy upon entering with nice relaxing music on the stereo Fantastically individual atmosphere with birdcages hanging from the ceiling and interesting artwork adorning the walls Staff seem friendly enough if a bit impersonal I ordered my black coffee at the bar was given a menu bound in a hardback copy of Disneys Beauty  the Beast noless and took my seat Coffee is from Artisan Roast on Broughton St so I wasnt surprised to taste a superbly balanced cup Marvellous I ordered the burger to eat Extras such as cheese and bacon are available on the menu from 050 to 1 but I ordered it as it comes No mention of accompanying fries or potato wedges is made on the menu so I held my breath I thought Surely for 8 Ill get fries AND a cherry on top I got out my laptop to do some work while I waited The free wifi worked for a few minutes before chucking me off and ceasing to function My burger arrived accompanied by small but lovely rocket tomato and olive salad Fresh leaves and nicely dressed Besides the salad there was nothing else on the plate apart from a hearty looking bun containing a burger and a few wilting leaves No fries no onion no cherry on top Oh well I thought the burger must taste excellent surely with an 8 price tag To my disgust the first bite revealed a barely cooked chunk of mincemeat Now I love my burger on the pink side but this was a step too far At the second time of asking my burger arrived and I ate but it felt overcooked and tough this time Perhaps finished in the microwave to ensure no more raw meat mishaps Who knows When I finished eating I sat in front of the empty plate for fifteen minutes before I left Surely good service stops when your guests leave your establishment not when youve just messed up their order and theyre sitting at one of your tables Ive eaten many vastly superior burgers in my days and paid less for the pleasure The cheaper burgers all came with fries too Still waiting for a cherry on top though I probably wouldnt go back to this bar certainly not to eat anyway All in all a crushing disappointment Especially on a quiet Thursday afternoon High point  fantastic coffee from Artisan roast tasty rocket with the burger Low point  leaving the place with that same bitter taste in the mouth you get when youve been mugged in broad daylight in a dodgy barIn here at the weekend for the first time in a few years Rammed so it was which meant manouvering past the bar was a tad tricky Only in to meet folk then move on so paid little attention to the wares on offer although apparently they have a lot of different gins Getting in early seems to be the idea although the service wasnt too bad given the amount of punters but I bet the staff have to work like trojans"

    "review":"This review is probably jumping the mark a bit because I didnt actually buy anything while I was hereThat insignificant fact aside I was so surprised when I wandered in 181 Delicatessen today  Its larger than it looks on the outside but still quite small and instead of being just another cafe or sandwich place it actually brings something new to the neighbourhood  Namely it combines the ability to buy lovely cheeses and meats by volume with a cafe setting to eat what theyve got on offer with a takeaway lunch area with shelves and shelves full of foodie things which you buy as presents for people because you secretly want them for yourself I will definitely come back her to try all of what they have on offer including stocking up on fancy schmancy edible Christmas presents which will probably break the bank but theyre local and oh so lovelyWhat a great wee delicatessen Basically the concept of this place is farm fresh to the high street which is brilliant When I first checked this place out I noticed a lot of my favorite items from the many farmers market around Edinburgh Also great hand made products from the shop like: Pesto sauce different dips quiches sweet baked itemsetc They also have a nice range of Italian French and Spanish charcuterie  cheeses At the back they have tables where you can sit it and eat some of their fresh homemade soup or sandwiches featuring their lovely products I have tried the Gordal olives which are very tasty and the chorizo vela which is really tasty and much cheaper than buying the prepackaged slices from supermarkets So much better freshly finely cut and very reasonably priced Ive also tried other meats which were all very tasty They have this really spicy Sicilian meat which is delicious paired with a baguette and some cheese I look forward to trying more stuff from them and definitely recommend this placeHavent eaten here but they can order in Findlaters gluten free bread which saves me the trip to EarthyJust a quick visit to collect bread but Ill try and browse longer next time as I was in a major rush beforeThe Findlaters bread comes in the tiger loaf white and oat If you order in advance they can get you the desired type I think they charge around 390 for the tiger loafSorry for not including any pictures with this review but weve eaten and drunk everything Suffice to say everything was lovely We had coffee and cakes and a very nice open salmon sandwich Quite pricey but then I guess this is Bruntsfield My coffee was perfect and my daughters hot chocolate was amazing All in all a very pleasant experience Lovely service too"

    "review":"A super cool new coffee joint hidden down a quiet cobbled street immediately gets good marks for first impressions The coffee was great and the food looked a cut above the usual although I never tried it on this occasion The only negative is similar to other comments in that the industrial decor of the place doesnt provide that comfy feel you want sometimes Also a bit of table rearranging to make more space would be useful This aside its a great new option for caffeine hit and would recommend itBrew lab is such a huge name in the coffee industry no matter where youre from so I was excited to hear about their new shop opening at the other end of town It isnt the easiest to find as its down a cute cobbled street in an industrial feel lock up The place has been fitted out sympathetically to the building with steel tables and clean lines throughout As you walk in  it has an edgy art gallery feel to it that is literally lit up with angular strip lighting I think the intention of this smaller sister brew lab is less of a sit down chill out kind of place and more of a grab a coffee on your way to work So with very few seats available thats what I did My usual choice is a flat white and with a Kenyan bean recommended thats what I went for Theyve certainly not lost their high standard of drinks with a smaller venue and my coffee was perfect Milk foamed beautifully and latte art to match Does Edinburgh need anymore coffee shops Probably not but its certainly not a bad thing to be so spoilt for choiceThere is so much to love about this new outlet of BrewLab In many ways I much prefer it to the well established original Its a little hidden down a lane in the west end If you didnt know it was there it would be like discovering an amazing cafe operating in someones garage Inside it looks completely different from the other BrewLab While the College Street cafe has a distressed furniture lowfi hipster aesthetic the new Brew Lab is bright clean industrial futuristic look Angled neonlights geometic patterns metal stools that look like meccano I absolutely loved the feel of it Ive been to so many coffee shops that all look the same its nice to see somewhere a bit differentBecause it is BrewLab they of course do great coffee I had a truly great filter from German roasters Five Elephant along with a warming curried soup Having foccacio with it was a nice touch A doughnut was compulsory of courseThe only reason it doesnt get 5 stars  whilst I love the bold design it seems unnecessarily impractical The is a lot of empty space and just 2 tables of 4 chairs and a bunch of stools around the outside When I was there one person was sitting at each table and 5 of us were huddled in a little corner bumping elbows I dont think this is designed to be a place to come and meet people for a coffee or lunch which I think is a shame because its got a great vibeI now have a Brew Lab within striking distance of my house  happy dance ensuesI have said it before and I will say it again: I am NOT in any way shape or form a coffee geek I know what I like and what I dont but I cant speak to single origin whatnots or the finer points of a pour over so places like Brew Lab have to stand up on their own two feet even if you took the coffee bits away and like their other spot in town they do so seamlessly As Stuart said the space here is very different from their other shop and has a rather industrial feel I prefer the homeyness of the other space which is the only reason why this doesnt make for five stars  its not the most welcoming space to curl up with some afternoon workBut other than that everything else is still on point: their flat whites are tasty the service is quick and friendly and they put up with my constant stream of dumb coffee noob questionsWelcome newbie Brew Lab"

    "review":"A tuckedaway Stockbridge gem that has been on my list of places to try for some months and it still is How you may ask can I be reviewing a restaurant I have yet to try Well dear reader I went there last week for a work christmas party and had a very good time But I remember very little of the evening THATs how good a time I hadA small cosy intimate restaurant with a Mexican theme the staff managed to make a party of 12 seem not only welcome but a joy to behold Im not sure this sentiment was shared by the other dinersThe menu is classically Mexican but the execution is a class above the bogstandard Nachos natch chimichangas burittos and enchilladas ditto but all done reportedly to perfection There are also Mexican style steaks and fish for the less conventionalThere may be puddings I cant remember They do serve cocktails and liquers for which I hold them entirely responsible So as I said at the outset I shall return to The Blue Parrot Cantina for a more sedate and considered meal as soon as they let me back in the doorCame here with my family a couple weeks back We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first 30 minutes we were there The service was really slow but good My family liked the guacamole I wasnt a huge fan but the salsa was yummy and I loved my main sweet potato enchiladas and my dad loves his chicken fajitas My sister and mom however didnt enjoy their meals much Pleasant experience overall but mixed feelings from the rest of the famHave we lived in Europe for so long that our standards for Mexican food have dropped or is Blue Parrot Cantina actually a good place to eat I think its the latter The menu isnt extensive but all the staples of a quality texmex place are there: burritos enchiladas chimichangas and more On our most recent visit we started with the black bean soup which was wellspiced and interesting I continued with a vegetable chimichanga which was every bit as good as I remember the chimichangas at our regular Mexican haunt from my stateside childhood The melted cheese was plentiful which is exactly how I like it The margaritas were tasty but not quite the right consistency  too little time in the blender left them at this awkward stage that was neither frozen nor on the rocks Service was fast and friendly and the food was obviously all prepared fresh in the small open kitchen The decor is simple yet appealing and theres a certain coziness to this lowlit basement dining roomThe Blue Parrot is a quirky little place in Stockbridge The chicken and cashew chimichanga I had was extremely good packed with mountains of succulent chicken Their soup was tasty also Service wasnt quite what it could have been and their cellarconversion toilets will divide opinion but its well worth a visitOverall we said: I was impressed with the Blue Parrot It served me two good dishes in quirky surroundingsIm not the worlds biggest fan of Mexican food not least because over the years Ive eaten in some very ropey Mexican places around Edinburgh but Id happily head back here the next time Im feeling the needWow Very underwhelming And I was so looking forward to boasting about having an amazing Mexican restaurant within metres of my home Lets get straight to it I cant fault the service They were friendly helpful and prompt Drinks were ok I didnt care for the wine glasses which were quite small and cheap looking Oh and the food Starters were the guacamole and pico de gallo Both under seasoned and quite bland There was nothing exciting about it Corn chips were also on the less salty side to eat was like eating crunchy and mushy anything My main was the beef enchilada I will say this is very reminiscent of taco bell US or taco bill Australia which is like tasteless meat wrapped in carbs with a side of mush refried beans covered in cheese There was nothing explosive or enticing about this meal I wouldnt go back because I get the gist It didnt feel exciting or authentic and not really a meal I would want again"

    "review":"That was the finest beef Ive ever tasted anywhere in the world Sir David Attenborough The haggis is pretty fucking awesome tootikichris I was up in Edinburgh recently where I made to sure to stop in at one of my all time favourite restaurants as in the whole friggin world Dubh Prais Despite its location in the heart of the Royal Mile it still retains loads of character and has a homey offthebeaten track feel to it Much of that has to do with it being in a wee basement I now have been to Dubh Prais three times I cant get past the haggis and the steak Next time Im in Edinburgh Im going to try to go twice: once for the haggis and the steak and another time to explore the menu a little more It looks delicious As should be expected from a top notch Scottish restaurant the whisky list is exceptional If youre planning a visit to Edinburgh definitely give Dubh Prais a go Youll be wise to make youre reservation well in advance for weekend evenings anyway Its tiny and has some very ardent fansIts a cozy location for decent Scottish food The service and atmosphere are very nice but for the cost the food could be better Theres nothing wrong with itquite tastybut the meat perhaps wasnt as highquality as Id expect and the flavors didnt meld as much as I would have wantedI had high expectations for Dubh Prais It is a tiny restaurant overrated not very fancy with overpriced average food The service was very slow and we felt like we were ignored The haggis was dry and venison overcooked I would not return here as there are plenty of better places to have Scottish food in EdinburghThis restaurant is well known for its great Scottish food  I have tried a few Scottish restaurant hoping to find a restaurant which provides an unpretentious Scottish food which is value for money  This is exactly the one  Not only is it value for money with good portion compared to other Scottish restaurant the taste does not disappoint  Whack bang in the middle of Royal Mile do give this place a try  Definitely one of the top Scottish restaurant in EdinburghOutstanding restaurant on the Royal Mile Cozy little place downstairs Very accommodating with our kids  no kids menu but flexible to find and make something they would enjoy  ordered the chicken stuffed with ham and cheese I got it as well regular preparation very tasty Husband got Angus steak  melt in your mouthDubh Prais Scottish restaurant is a small exquisite restaurant located below street level of the busy Royal Mile When I say small this restaurant holds about 12 or 15 tables if that When the wife and I walked in they asked if we had a reservation we did not They were happy to accommodate us and the chef even assured us a great meal as he peaked around the corner of the kitchen I had the Venison that was served with a Port wine sauce and very tasty potatoes I must say the Venison was full of flavor and quite moist with no overpowering flavor of the meat The sauce complimented the Venison very well and brought the flavor out to tantalize the taste buds This is a great restaurant with a very comfortable atmosphere the staff goes out of the way to make you feel very welcome"

    "review":"War eigentlich ganz nett Klar ein bichen abgefuckt aber wenn man drauf steht : Viele Landsleute und es entstehen nette Gesprche sofern man sie zulsstPreise: gnstig Auswahl: gutI spotted this while walking around in the day and I loved the nameLater in the evening after having something to eat we decided to go have a drink as we walked in it was really busy and modernI didnt realise they did food but it looked great We decided to have a cocktail they were so reasonably priced and really tasty I had a few cocktails but the boozy bru was my fave it had gin citrus and irn bru which I though was fab They used irn bru in s few of there cocktails and I though that was a really good ideaBefore we went home we went back to have a burger and a few more cocktails the burgers were really tasty I had a cheese burger and me and my partner shared some chips Its a really great place and I loved everything shout itThe staff were really friendly and helpfull if Im in edinburgh again Im defiantly going backThe Boozy Cow was fine Not sure Id go back but the meal was satisfying enough I ordered the bacon cheeseburger along with fried pickles onion rings and sweet potato fries The burger was ok  nothing amazing but not awful either The meat patty was quite small so there was a bit of nomming before I got to it The sides fared better with crispy fried pickles and dipping sauce yummy sweet potato fries and huge onion rings that hit the spot I ordered a can of Red Stripe to wash it all down and the can arrived freezing cold with a chilled glass which was a good touch Word of warning  there are no plates or cutlery so I was pleased that the waiter gave us some wee side plates to eat our food off I hate paying through the nose for food that doesnt even arrive on a plate Your fingers get gross and sticky so it was a good move that the staff offered towelettes for your hands after eating Otherwise ewwAmbience wise it felt more like a loud pub than an eating establishment The decor was dark and grimy with paint splattered all over the walls The seats were high wobbly stools with narrow tables made from chipboard I felt like I was sitting in an industrial abattoir so I wasnt a fan of the decor much at all The music was seriously loud so the patrons were shouting in order to hear each other It all felt a bit like The Boozy Cow is trying too hard So all in all fair grub but nothing astonishing delivered in an establishment that feels like the insides of an internal organI cant decide how I feel about this placeTheyve nothing on draught which I find a bit odd But a decent selection of canned beers Which I find okThey do a great fast food platter thing which I like But they put that awful cheap watery cheese they have in the States That I do not likeIts a place I really want to like and feel I could quite easily They just need to cut out the weird crapWe were recommended to check this place out by another local pub so away we went our our journeyThe boy tried the Mac N Cheese Burger which he really enjoyed I was enthralled with the Maple Bacon CheeseburgerThough the food was tasty the service was quite slow and did not come with a smile Maybe it was an off day for our server It really was too bad We had already waited for quite a while in the bar downstairs and we were looking forward to trying this place outUnfortunately they dont have a take away license This was really a bummer because their meals are way too much to eat in one sitting figure in drink prices etc and this makes it even worse Its quite a waste to eat here when youre on a budgetThe food was good lets start off there with the positive I had a chipotle chicken burger and a cherry Coke float and I cant really fault them The place itself hmm not a big fan of the chipboard walls and graffiti and less of a fan of the metal floor as everytime you moved your chair it made a racketWhen we sat down we were told we were in for a unique dining experience wed be eating of trays no cutlery would be provided unless we specifically asked and napkins were in the form of an entire roll of kitchen rollThis is where I was less keen I like cutlery I was always going to ask for some The metal trays well that was just a bit weird sharing a tray of food with the person sitting opposite you Not entirely sold on the idea again whats wrong with a plate Not sure what would have happened if one of us was veggie and didnt want our food on the same tray wasnt an issue for us but stillOverall no I dont think Id go back the burgers were nice but its not like Edinburgh has a shortage of burger places"

    "review":"A longstanding Edinburgh tradition Valvona and Crolla is an awesome delicatessen with an amazing array of food and drink From gorgeous cheeses and cold meats to rare Greek brandies that you cant buy anywhere else in Edinburgh the experience of VC is one to savour slowly And keep your eye on how much youre spending  you get what you pay for which is reliable quality in every purchaseAmazing customer service My wife and I are big fans of Alexander McCall Smiths 44 Scotland Street series of comic novels in which VC is featured as part of the setting in Edinburgh The characters pop in to Valvona  Crolla for their sundried tomatoes olive oils wines and other delicacies Angus dog Cyril once surreptitiously ate a small salami that was knocked of a shelf Having never been to Scotland I didnt know if VC was a creation of the authors imagination or a real shop I Googled and discovered that it is indeed real Next I found a perfect gift for my wife a Valvona and Crolla shopping bag After setting up an online account I began to input my PayPal and shipping info only to discover that there is no provision for shipping outside the UK Alastair and the Despatch Team to the rescue He answered my questions got me a shipping quote and gave instructions on filling out the forms My order is now on the way to Texas via Royal Mail Hooray and it occurs to me that Mr McCall Smith is also a fan of this fine establishment since he features it in the novels Thanks again and Happy ChristmasA cute little Italian gourmet shop Totally unexpected to find in Scotland Good variety of wines and beer too Cheeses meets pasta sauces They have it all With a little bistro in the back Outside of the more touristy areas and not as easy to find but definitely worth a visitAMERICANS and ITALIANS who appreciate lasagne that has not been precooked this is your savior Not even Lupe Pintos my favorite little shop in the universe has lasagne that has not been precooked I will not explain myself to you UKers who say But who cares if its precooked Its the meat and cheese that matterWhat is the difference or my favorite I cant taste any difference You and your bad opinions are wrong You know what I feel the same way about instant mashed potatoes not true but using for effect  how do you like THAT Valvona and Crolla has many many good attributes which everyone else has already written about So I am here to tell you about Valvona and Crolla the only place in Edinburgh to get unprecooked lasagneI purposely sought this place out when deciding where to eat on a Sunday afternoon Theyre cafe hours are slightly restrictive so we had to rush over but it was worth itI last visited Valvona  Crolla when I was 12 with family to get some supplies for a homemade Italian meal When I walked back in last Sunday 13 years later it hasnt change one bit  and for the better Dont be fooled by the small unassuming and slightly rundown looking exterior Itd be easy to walk by But once youre inside a cavernous deli and freshveg haven awaits you It was established in the 1930s and it seems it has lasted for nearly 100 years due to the divine and authentic Italian deli produceI wont harp on too much Basically the deli is vast and delicious Come here if you want to buy some topquality ingredients from a traditional deli rather than the mainstream and slightly more expensive and probably lesser quality counters in Jenners etcI did actually visit for the cafe As I said the hours are restrictive It closes at 330pm on a Sunday which is quite early  However the food lived up to expectation and wasnt overly pricey I had the Polish Ham cheese and mushroom foccacia: mm mm mmmm Coupled with freshsqueezed orange juice and realleaf tea WonderfulOnly downside is the decor of the cafe is a little uninspired Its a big area but the tables and decor is very circa mid90s British cafe It seems to lose all romance and authenticity of the Deli only a few steps away So not exactly the perfect setting for a romantic date But for amazing delicious authentic Italian cuisine this is one of Edinburghs best kept secretsThis has to be Edinburghs number one deli This little place is absolutely packed with sauces wines cheeses and meats The front of the shop is quite narrow and is filled with Italian foods and has fresh meats and cheeses on offer at the deli Behind the deli the high wall is dominated by a whole range of bottles Indeed it is so high that the staff dont use a ladder to get a bottle down but instead use a gripping deviceI would be very nervous indeed using that many bottles would end up smashed on the floor if it was me The shop is full of tempting smells and the smell of fresh bread always leads you to the back of the shop And there you find a large selection of Italian wines a lot of very good red wines A good bottle of red with some fresh bread and cheeseI would say thats a good shop"

    "review":"One of my favourite Edinburgh Indians The food is always tasty and well presented I like the fact that there are curries on the menu you dont get anywhere else in Edinburgh When I have brought friends that like a vindaloos they have often complained it is not spicy enough I have never enjoyed vindaloos but the spicy dishes I order are spicy enough for me and still allow the flavours of the other ingredients to shine through Best gulab jamun and kulfi I have ever had and I dont usually do desserts especially not Indian desserts Usually find them too sweet  Staff are friendly and attentiveIn Edinburgh on holiday we came across this restaurant and made reservations with our new friends from tour  Everything about this place is excellent: food variety service atmosphere etc  we ordered the prix fixe tasting menu and were wowed by each and every morsel Every new dish provided us with a unique set of flavors  And the dishes just kept coming  If I had one complaint its that there was just too much food  Come here hungryThe spices were mostly NOT hot just flavorful  I suspect that they can heat up the plates a bit but we did not mind the great dishes that did not burn our tonguesDont hesitate to go hereCame here while in Edinburgh because of the high reviews on Yelp We came early and was asked to wait while they were still cleaning the floors We sat for about 10 min and was seated I was really looking forward to a great Indian meal but what we got was really bland food Since this was the second Indian restaurant we had while in UK that was bland and flavorless we figured this is just how it is served on the other side of the pond It seemed like the food needed some more flavoring or cooked longer to bring out the taste Was very disappointing although the restaurant was very clean and the bathroom was very niceMy son and girlfriend went to this restaurant tonight  They are not registered users of yelp and asked me to put in a good word for the Mumbai  They had the  pasanda and the lamb rezala  They said both were excellentI enjoyed my visit here I placed my trust in the helpful waiter to choose what I ate and was rewarded with two tasty courses Im not sure the place is capable of outstanding culinary fireworks but it terms of reliable fresh Indian dishes I was very happy with the placeOverall we said: I was really pleased with Mumbai Mansion I feel that I could go there again put my trust in the waiters choices and be served some more good dishes If youre in the neighbourhood Id certainly say to you that its worth stopping in to sample some of their high quality dishesA nice Saturday lunch with my husband to Mumbai Mansion  We are here fairly frequently and this time it is with a living social discount voucher  I like the veggie  non spicy options they have on the menu but I was a bit disappointed that they could not accommodate my request to add paneer Indian cheese with my vegetable korma even though I advised I was happy to pay the difference in cost  The staff are attentive and the food is very prompt and tasty  The restaurant is spotlessly clean and well presented  A nice touch is the place mats that are done as the Calcutta new paper and you can sit and read their news articles which are humerus  A great local Indian restaurant which I will be back to soon no doubt"

    "review":"Mezbaan often seem to be left out of favourite curry restaurant lists It often seems to escape the limelight This is undeservedMezbaan is an Indian restaurant specialising in South Indian cuisine Every curry dish I have had hear is scrumptious i have heard one person complaining that the curry wasnt authentic South Indian I cant really comment on this but I can give the taste and presentation a thumbs up And for me thats what a matteredPrices are pretty reasonable I ate here with a friend with two courses and it cost us around 25Also note that its BYOB This shouldnt be a problem as being near Tollcross there are several supermarkets and actually a small grocers right next doorSad to say I have to disagree with all the other reviewers about how great this place is   the restaurant gets two points for the food but ive docked another because of my lost umbrella and ehh service We went to the restaurant and they told us to come back in 15 minutes because they dont have any seats open Ok so we go to the bar next door grab a drink and come back in 20 minutes  Still no seat available By this time Im super hungry and about to fall over But we wait  Another 20 minutes pass and FINALLY we get seatedWe ordered the overpriced thali and the salmon tikka tomato rice and naan  Naan was fine salmon tikka was horribly fishy  Thali was okay but wayyy overpriced  Its  essentially a hodgepodge of different curries   I mean 1595 for all that  And the tomato rice dont get me staretd on that  It tasted liek someone dipped all the rice into a vat of butter and handed to me on a plate I am married to a south indian so i know whats good  That was NOT good  Naan was the only thing that was okay in my opinion and I saked for dry naan but again no one seemed to listen  The icing on the top was that we left our umbrella there and were clearly the last people in the restaurant we call the restaurant to ask to pick it up and the guy said they didnt have it  come on really its only an umbrellaWould i recommend to others That would be ahem NOGood flavor Seems authentic  Beware of the coupon for a free glass of wine Per the waiter that was expired  Worth the visitI got the Medu Vada and Masala Dosa In general the flavor was decent but lacked freshness Specifically the dosa was soft chutney  masala filling lacked flavor However the sambar was not bad The food needs improvement in terms of preparation and freshness I believe they have potential if improvedDosa was thick soft and limp Thats not how theyre supposed to be  thin and crispy was the expectation And the potato palya filling Meh There was also some ugly pinkcolored yoghurtbased concoction on my plate The sambar was OK the coconut chutney left something to be desired and there was no cilantrochile chutney which I missedMezbaan is a sensational restaurant serving authentic South Indian cuisine Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh Mezbaan is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach and with the outside of the restaurant painted a lovely bright maroon colour it would be difficult to miss it The Mezbaan menu offers a vast range of authentic South Indian dishes such as kebabs and dosas rich pancakes served with a filling I came here for dinner several months ago with a friend and I had an absolutely beautiful meal I had the mixed pakoras for a starter which were tasty but my main course of Chili Beef was definitely something to write home about The beef was cut into the tiniest slices and then fried along with peppers and onions in a chili sauce  yum It was a pretty spicy meal but definitely something that I would order again The prices for the meals in Mezbaan are quite reasonable considering it is in the Tollcross area The starters are priced at around five pounds and the main courses are more expensive at about ten to fifteen pounds  but the food is definitely worth it Mezbaan also do takeaways and home deliveries which is incredibly handy so they get a big thumbs up from me"

chains and was looking for something with more character This place was spot on with very nice coffee but what really sold it for me was the staff and the relaxed atmosphere Definitely will be backStrangely overlooked on George Street this little caf cum Italian restaurant is a gem I think it is under new management as the staff definitely arent as friendly as before but it still has a good little atmosphere I have popped in for both a quick coffee and a pastry which are excellent by the way and for a full meal and have to say I have been impressed with bothThe staff are lovely less so now but I might have just caught them on a bad day and immediately make you feel really at home The menu is pretty standard Italian but the quality of food is excellent Feeling a bit like Jeff Vader I went for the Penne Arrabbiatta which was really good Normally I dont go for pasta and tomatoy sauces because I feel like I can make them at home but I couldnt face a pizza and this was really flavoursome I have had the pizzas other times and the buffalo mozzarella is great on them I had the Calabrese which was also really goodThe prices are quite pricey about 9 for pasta and pasta on average but the food is really good and it is in the centre of George Street to be fair Because of this it can be a bit too busy as it is not very big it fills up quickly so make sure you get in early Apart from that though it is one of the better Italian restaurants in the centre of townSummary: Nice for coffee and a panini try somewhere else for dinnerDetail: Ive been here twice now The first time was for a coffee and snack a few months ago after shopping and that was great good coffee and excellent value panini with salad etc Service is quick and friendly The second was for dinner and we werent too impressed We ordered the olive appetiser expecting some of those nice herby olives in oil you usually get but what turned up was the cheapest possible olives from brine on iceberg lettuce not impressed We both had pizza for mains but they were nowhere near as nice as youd get in other places in Edinburgh for example Prezzo or even Pizza Express Mine had tons of cheese but little in the way of tasty herbs etc and the other was apparently disappointing as well Desserts were pretty good I had the lemon sorbet So good for a stop and a nibble not so good for an evening outMmnnnn In reading everyone elses review I dont know if Im being harsh or not but Im not a fan of this place Ive been in a couple of times recently Once for coffee and cake which was an ok experience Central location but there are so many other nicer places nearby you can go for a fabulous coffee in a nicer setting Plus I found the squoosh of canned cream next to my bit of lemon drizzle cake a bit cheap and it coloured my perception of their Italian home bakingNext visit was for food during the festival primarily cause we walked past and the folk I was with said we should go in as they couldnt be bothered trying to find anywhere else that would take 6 It wouldnt have ever been on my list of places to eat Italian food in Edinburgh however Im happy to go with the flow on occasion as Im hoping to be surprised I wasnt Pasta was overcooked an offence in Italy and the sauce wasnt all that Weird tasting meatballs kinda tasted like they were frozen from Costco Nothing authentic about this place in my mind apart from the Italian waiter The place had a slightly grubby look to it which might have been down to the huge amount of tourist traffic in and out for the festival but still No toilet paper in the ladies either Grump So cannot recommend But as I say I might just be more harsh than others :Caffe Centro is a very nice Italian cafe on George Street It is often packed on lunch time which is no surprise since their food is pretty good You can get anything from soups sandwiches and salads to pastas and pizzas Or if you are an early bird you can get a good breafast as wellHowever I had my eyes set on some dessert as I had just had lunch elsewhereI wanted to cry from delight as I scanned their dessert menu when I saw that banana split was on the menu I love it its simple but delicious IF done correctlyNB there are some establishments in Edinburgh that include canned fruit in banana split which is just wrong wrong wrongI am glad to confirm that Caffe Centro knows how to do a banana split properly My bowl consisted of banana vanilla ice cream whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce see picture Thats all that is needed And it was amazing :Next time I might try one of their other desserts as there was plenty of choice"

    "review":"Ive been using this place for the last 4 years and have found it consistently good for takeawayProbably not the best Chinese Ive had but none the less very good  Delivery is very quick  usually within 20 minsI would definitely come here again any day of the week  The staff are some of the friendliest Ive come across and make every effort to make you feel welcome  Although the food actually took a while to arrive we werent bothered just because the guy behind the counter had a smile on his face the whole time  The menu is well priced and has a good range of authentic chinese dishes  Their egg fried rice is excellent and tastes really aromatic and moist  I had it with sweet and sour duck which was also amazing and had a great range of flavours  I certainly recommend Good Year its so friendly its almost funThis is the best takeaway that Ive managed to stumble across in this area and not only that but it manages to couple this with being the best value as well  This feat is achieved as is so often the case with my favourite takeaways by offering rice as a separate item rather than as an item included in the priceI pass through here on my way home and along here you get a line of very good and very friendly with this place no exception shops that will serve your needs most admirably  As a result Im more than happy to stop here to visit the shops that have remained open and if its late enough or indeed sometimes early enough in the day pick up a meal on my way and then cook the rice myself when I get inAs the meals go these start at 390 and go up from here without really venturing beyond a fiver so its certainly good value for money  Whether you want to sit in or takeaway this place is worth a visitBad week Good Year I tried this place out after a disaster of a few days ending in my oven exploding Great excuse to try something GoodGood Year has a standard Chinese Takeaway format Dont expect anything out of this world But as Takeaways go its pretty good For a start I completely agree with Gibson about the staff I also had a really great smiley service The place itself was nice and clean and smart which is something I always like in a takeawayThe food is decent but nothing out of the ordinary Fairly standard for a Chinese takeaway but maybe a little less greasy than normal For vegetarian dishes expect to pay on average around 6 which might seem like a bit too much I think it is but this is a bit better quality than your average ChineseA slight cut above the rest Very friendly staff I might just give this place another goNot recommended Was served dirty plates which we asked to be cleaned  Food was basically standard takeaway food served on a plate It was good for a takeaway but not for the price of it 810 a dish not including rice I had the chicken satay and my partner had salted chilli pork and egg fried rice He liked his meal but he likes dry food so has weird opinions My meat was squashy and the sauce was just a sweet flavour with no hint of peanutPrawn crackers were good Interior of the place is run down and dirty with awful carpeting and mess visible in the back of the restaurant The waiter hovered around behind us which put me off a lot"

    "review":"In my relentless if not very widereaching search for a good margarita this Latin American restaurant comes top of my list And I have it on good authority that it is ditto for the mojito But you dont just come here for the cocktails If you are a regular consumer of mexican food you will recognise many of the dishes on the menu nachos enchiladas etc BUT and its a very fine BUT there are several more esoteric dishes to try and try them you should My personal obsession is Pabellon Margariteno a fish dish that looks unspeakable but tastes divine Tool up on the cocktails and go for dishes youve never heard of Go on go on go on Oh and the prices are good the atmosphere friendly and the decor VERY LOUDWe checked Sabor Criollo on the recommendation of a friend who regularly works in South America and knows good food from the area when she sees it It didnt disappoint A twocourse meal is very reasonably priced at 1399 a head on a Saturday night The place was busy when we were there but the service was fast courteous and friendly I had the fajitas delicious and my wife had the shredded beef both of which were fantastic This is a great little place tucked away smack in the middle of Stockbridge and well be going againThe place has a nice atmosphere and theyve made an effort to make this basement location feel more lively colourful and south americanish The service is really nice and friendly as well and Im pretty sure most of the waiters speak spanish which is a good sign when youre eating in a south american placeSo why only 3 stars I love mexicansouthern food so maybe Im a slightly harsh critic but I just wasnt really taken with the menu Everything we ordered was a bit too overflowing with cheese and creme fraiche so the vibrant flavours were drowned out The menu isnt really expensive 15 for 2 courses but considering the fierce competition with set menus in Edina its probably a touch high for such simple food plain rice beans chicken flour tortillas and side saladOn a Yelp dinner night out I had the pleasure to dine at Sabor Criollo in StockbridgeAnd boy its great to be with Yelp because who knows when I would have gone there myself and this way I had most lovely company and a great dinnerThe restaurant is a little harder to find at least if you are like me a NewEdinburgher and are not used yet to restaurants being in the souterrainIts a funnily decorated place that manages to let you forget that you are sitting in a basement which I wish more of these bars and restaurants would doNow the food: mexicansouth americanIts excellent try their mojillos these mussels were delicious for a starterFajitas and Quesadillas are normally not something I particularly care for but theirs are great definitely a reason for me to come back againI would have liked to try their desserts but I simply could not eat another dish so I can only account for for what I had and can ensure you its worth the way to StockbridgeSo many times Ive walked past this place and thought oh Latin American food I didnt notice that there Ive probably done this at least a dozen times It doesnt look like much from the outside but dont be fooled inside is a lovely venue with authentic Latin American food With quite a small number of tables I would recommend you book on a weekend When busy this place is loud Like yell at the person sitting opposite you loud which I found to be a bit of an inconvenience Acoustics aside the food and drinks are quite good 5 cocktails which I think is a reasonable price In terms of food there is a special where you can get a starter and main for just under 15 which I thought was great value My food which for the life of me I cant pronounce Came out freshly prepared and well presented I do wish there was a bit more flavour to the shredded beef which was quite bland Overall definitely worth giving this place a try If not for the food at least for the cocktailsI recently moved into a new flat near Stockbridge and during one of the many journeys from my old place to the new one my boyfriend and I noticed a basement restaurant with LATIN AMERICAN FOOD written on the side  As a Californian I am in a constant quest for good LatinMexican food so when the car was unloaded we decided to wander down and check this place outThe restaurant is small and cute  It was hosting a large party of partially intoxicated women celebrating a 40th birthday who provided some excellent people watching between courses  I think this would be a fun place to come with a big party as they serve cocktails margaritas yummmmm in big pitchers and the space is well setup for itWe had our drinks order taken within minutes of sitting down which was a definite plus and the margaritas were the best Ive had in Edinburgh another big plus  The big negative was that despite asking several times we were never brought water which we found very odd  We shared a starter of nachos  I remember being impressed at the salsa which tasted home made  They also came with black beans which were a very tasty additionMy guy ordered a dish which I kind of remember so I just went to the website to look it up but the menu tab takes me to a page that says MENU and nothing else  Er I remember it was something which they called traditionally Venezuelan and it was nice  It was different which is something I always enjoy  I ordered their famous fajitas  I have had great fajitas all over Edinburgh and I do love them sooo much  I realise theyre not sexy or unusual but man they are tasty  I loved the chargrilled tastiness that was cooked into the chicken and the veggies  BUT they fajitas were as they always are served with sour cream guacamole and salsa  Ive already commented on how I liked the salsa so I was shocked at the guac and sour cream  The guacamole tasted like it was Tesco value guacamole  Fine for a pub but not fine for a Latin American restaurant  It was green but Im really not sure it even had avocados in it  My boyfriend argued that avocados are expensive and this place probably couldnt afford to make their own guac but I think its an expense which is necessary for a Latin American restaurant  The sour cream was even more disappointing  Im a huge fan of sour cream so was surprised when I wasnt tasting the tangy wonderfulness which I love so much  I stuck my finger in it to taste it plain and was shocked to discover that it was cream heavy cream  In addition to loving sour cream I bake  A lot  I know what cream tastes like and that was creamWhen the waiter came to take our plates our exchange went like this:Him:  So how was everythingMe:  It was great  Were stuffed  But I just have to ask smile did you run out of sour cream tonight big smile Him:  Im sorryMe:  smile I was just wondering if you ran out of sour cream because thats actually creamHim: No its notMe:  Oh ehm it really didnt  taste like sour cream to meHim: Well it is but I will ask the kitchenMe: Thanks oh and can we get our bill pleaseA few minutes later the waiter came back to assure me that it was indeed sour cream and was then never to be seen againWe sat for about 15 minutes trying to catch someones eye to bring us the bill before we just stood up and went directly to the counter to pay  So Im left with really mixed feelings about this place  I would definitely have gone back to try the food with more of a Venezuelan twist if the waiters hadnt decided to dessert our table because of my question  I find it hard to give places a second chance when they fall down so hard in areas like service and quality of ingredients"

    "review":"This wee cafe is perfectly located right next to the beach and island in Cramond After a wee wander around you will most probably  want a nice warm cup of hot chocolate this place does the job We didnt eat anything here I had a lovely hot chocolate and my partner had a cafe latte which were both perfectly fine Wee one had a hot chocolate too which was warm and not too hot for her Overall a very satisfactory experience Definitely recommend visiting this area for the beautiful walks and nice warm beverageIts never a good sign when your reviews entirely contradict the previous wait those were like 3 years ago Phew Good to know No idea what the place was like 3 years ago but it was a pleasant enough visit in 2014 I wouldnt be lusting after another visit but certainly not the miserable experience noted as previous We had soup cullen skink and tomato  lentil  what looked to be smallish bowls turned out to be the Mary Poppins of bowls  this soup seemed to grow and was crazy filling yo Cullen skink so fresh it had some leftover bones added flavour although quite salty even by my saltencrusted standards Tomato and lentil was well received and didnt require further seasoning either Scones were presented warmed through with jam and butter and pretty tasty Didnt feel shop bought either or look it We also got sandwiches but they left with us too for later as soup and a sandwich here was just too much Would note the sandwich options arent super exciting and some more appealing options were available in the 1295 two course menu but I was reluctant to pay 8 quid for a salad when it didnt seem much different in content to the 450 sandwiches salmon and prawn salad with toast versus a salmon salad sandwich All pleasant enough and certainly not the disappointment kitchens also clean on our visit too Cash preferred credit cards under 10 come at a supplementary costThis is such a quaint little place : I love Crammond beach and this is a great place to hide if the wind gets a bit too muchLow ceilings exposed beams woodburning stove Just lovely We got a table straight away and read the menus while being distracted by all the artwork They display artists work which is for sale and they also have murals covering some of the walls Just lovely We opted for Ms Jean Brodies Afternoon Tea This came with a sandwich cut into triangles a scone and a slice of tea cake as well as a drink For 795 considering where it is located that was a very reasonable price The sandwich was lovely I got egg mayo and the white bread while plain was very fresh As far as a lunch goes it was nice I couldnt finish the tea cake as it was a little on the dry side and I was full My only other slight niggle was that they served a little pot of whipped cream for the scone which just didnt work I dont know if theyd just ran out or what but it was the only real complaint about the food Service was lovely atmosphere ideal and left with full bellies Happy times indeed :"

    "review":"With 4 staff on it still took ten minutes to prepare a bacon roll at breakfast time 175 for soft drinks struck me as expensive and I was short changed by 2 All in all not a good experiencePoor food  poor serviceI visited this place for a late breakfast with a few friends We arrived gone midday and specifically asked if they were still serving breakfast upon arrival we were told yes but service would be a little slow on breakfasts and there would be a wait for a table  After waiting half an hour for a table we were finally seated but told upon ordering breakfast was not possible despite diners around us having breakfasts the man serving us was a little rudeflustered we asked what we could have then and he said there are the specials we said okay well have a special and were then told we couldnt have a special as there were no ciabattas  after reviewing the menu under pressure and paying up front we later presumed this was down to the high chance of people refusing to pay and or the lack of communication between the staff we placed ordersWe then waited for a good amount of time and one half of someones order turned up the soup half of soup  a sandwich 10 minutes later my own order turned up  a poor sandwich on stale bread wilting lettuce in a bowl and two slices of cucumber which looked to be going the same way with an odd smattering of a mystery sauce Ive had better sandwiches from petrol stationsDeciding on giving up on their sandwich coming my friend started eating his soup only comment from him was heinzby the time he had finished his soup my other friends ham and cheese toastie arrived  We all understood a toastie to be a toasted sandwhich this appeared to be a sandwich made with toast instead of bread  She bit into the sandwich and put it straight down it was ice cold ham and grated cheese in the middle which hurt her teeth  Some more time passed and a waiter appeared with my first friends sandwich and one mores bagel they took the toastie off for full toasting Around 10 minutes passed and the half eaten toastie reappeared  At this point almost everyone had finished their meal except one person who hadnt been served at allJust as the retoasted toastie was finished the final meal appeared and the waitress 4th member of staff wed seen at this point  asked in a really uncertain way whether we had everything  Two minutes later the original server came over and asked if we had everything making it damn clear they had no idea what was going onOn the way out there was no word of thanks or apology from the staff stood by the doorA nice place to catch a fine breakfast Enjoyed it outside even as we had to face the chilly september winds raging through the narrow alleyWe only had the cream tea but the scones were perfect Highly recommendThe shortbread was perfectGreat central locationCame here with a group of friends after getting off the night coach from London They took a while to open up and let us in but the cashier lady was nice Ordered a salmon sandwich which came with greens and tried a ham sandwich from my friend Sandwiches were nicely sized but there wasnt anything that really stood out We really wanted to try a scone but since they just opened scones wouldnt be available until later Three starts because there wasnt anything that really stood out to me and the servers that were setting up werent very friendly towards us and we felt pretty unwelcomed But did find their giant teacup pots amusingWe stopped by the Deacons House for some breakfast and to get out of the rain  The two of us went for the standard breakfast which was mediocre  Its hard to screw up some eggs and bacon and sausage but they gave it a good go  The eggs were scrambled but seemed like they were sat in a puddle of water  The food was edible but only just  I dont know what it is but it was hard to find a decent breakfast in EdinburghI did however like the coffee and also the cafe itself which used to be the workshop of the Deacon whos real name I have forgotten and the story behind this guy  Although a respected cabinetmaker he was also a thief and he and his friend and cocrook were hanged on gallows that the cabinetmaker built  Ill bet the guy wished he didnt do such a great job on them"

    "review":"MehThe bartender wasnt very friendly we got a mojito that was a special for 3 pounds which seemed cheap until we got it It was about 50 iceI got the vegetarian ramen with tofu The broth was tasty but there were literally I counted 4 small bites of tofu so I finished it still hungry My partner got some noodle bowl which he liked Our server was nice but not super competent She forgot to give me a spoon when I got my ramen and it took forever to waive her down to get one She never filled up our water glasses or ask if we wanted moreShe was nice enough to give us a student discount although we did not have our student IDs on us which is the only thing saving them from a 2 star reviewI got a pancake thing for dessert It was fine I guessAll in all Mehits fairly hard to really rate Bar Soba  i was only there briefly as id stopped by to celebrate friends birthdays with a quick drink  however the venue is central and on a busy saturday night i was able to get served at the bar in under five minutes  the bartender was happy to advise my friend about what sort of drink she should have based on her taste preference and my glass of prosecco and friends gt were under a tenner in price  while all this was great i cant say i really liked Bar Soba as a place to go for a drink  it was loudlike so loud i actually lost the ability to try to have a conversation with people because i just couldnt hear them  i struggle to understand why people go to places where they cant speak to the people theyre with but maybe thats an age thing or maybe this just really wasnt my sort of place  so for the fact i was able to get served quickly standard drinks werent pricey and i managed to get a seat on a busy saturday night this place gets 3 starsSo this was my second time going and I was a bit dubious about going especially as this time we were going in a very big group As I thought it was very slow but then there was a lot of us so maybe that can be excused to some extent The food however was nothing to write home about and talking to others there were mixed reviews but the main consensus was that it was fine I felt it was not worth the money we paid which was 2750 for three courses Disappointing The staff had seemed generally fine earlier in the night when serving but when we had finished our food and were standing around drinking they just looked a bit irritated when pushing through the crowds of us We still had a fun night and it seemed like a good space once we took over the whole restaurant part but this place is not for meThis visit to Bar Soba was a spontaneous decision We went at lunchtime Not too busy so we sat on the top conservatory bit this ensured us with some sun I was planning to get some Thai food and I actually ended up with maki thing and a prawn chili stir fry Anita had a roti with satay chicken All was very tasty and well spicedhot however passing of a wrap used for fajitas as roti is not cool man Service was attentive and efficient though later when busy it waned a little and we decided to pay at the till to free up the table and spare the girl trips back  forth I like the atmosphere the mixed stylish functional furniture and the little nooks Nice afternoon barI do like a voucher meal and bar soba often offers good deals that would be rude to miss I liked the funky ambiance the super friendly and quirky waitress and more than anything their menu was right up my alley so was their food Steamed Beef dumplings were succulent and so flavoursome The could resist tasting my husband chicken satay and that also was fabulously tasty I went for the Japanese chicken  katsu curry and my hubby picked chilli chicken with garlic and herbs Nicely plated and with a good mix of chilli heat perfect for our taste we like it spicy Cause we were having such a good time we stayed for desserts and cocktails their cocktail list is extensive so you can easily find a match for each different palate Ill definitely would go back no hesitationI really like the Bar Sobas in Glasgow so when I heard there was one in Edinburgh not far from my work office I couldnt wait to try it out6 of us were heading along so we booked a table in advance and asked for downstairs despite this when we arrived there was no table ready for us and then we were offered one of the bar type tables upstairs where you sit on stools  At over 8 months pregnant I wasnt so keen on sitting here which the waitress actually spotted instantly before I could even mention it and offered us a seat downstairsBar Soba have just launched their new lunch menu and to celebrate for the whole of April its BOGOF on starters mains and dessert result  I was relieved to see that one of my favourite main courses the Nasi Goreng made the cut as there are maybe 6 starters plus a number of sushi options and 6 mains on the new lunch menuWe ordered starters and mains and then the waiter told us that at lunch they bring the food as its ready and did that bother usI guess a bit like Wagamamaswe said okay then wondered what would happen  5 of us got our starters and main courses all brought out at once with the final person just receiving their main  To be honest I didnt really like it I had ordered sticky ribs and then a burger and eating my ribs watching my burger and fries get cold was a bit rubbishThe ribs were excellent and a huge portion but the burger was less than average  It is made with lemon grass and other spices through it which I could taste but you couldnt really tell it was a beef patty  My friends were impressed with their choices including california rolls tempura and yellow curry so I recommend sticking with one of the asian inspired mains rather than the burger"

    "review":"I do love a good sandwich bar  There are loads springing up along the lines of what is provided by Subway and Baguette Express  Wolfits on Rose Street is one of these  They offer a wide range of sandwiches paninis and wraps all made fresh on the day  They can also make these to order  They also do other hot food like breakfasts and bacon rolls so will cater for most of your snackbased needs  Prices seemed to be reasonable and the range of fillings and things available will easily compete with some of the larger high street chains  I suspect that this is the sort of place that will get heard about by word of mouth and that you will want to keep visitingI only sat in to get out of a heavy rainstorm with a refreshing drink of funnily enough water  This gave me ample time to have a look round  the shop and take in what was going on    I was very impressed  clean and modern with a great range of stuff to eat  Give them a go if youre ever on Rose Street and need somewhere to eatWolfits is one of many sandwich and salad bars in Edinburgh but it is worth a visit Situated on Rose Street Wolfits is right in the centre of the city and it is just around the corner from the main shopping area in Edinburgh Princes Street and so it is a convenient place to reach They serve a whole range of sandwiches baguettes and rolls as well as lots of salad options and soup I have been here several times over the last few weeks to buy my lunch They have a deli type section displaying a range of filings such as meats cheeses and salad I have played it pretty safe here and stuck to their steak and cheese baguette which is really tasty and very well priced at less than 3 Breakfast rolls are also available here so it would be a good place to stop by for a bacon roll in the morning This store is pretty much an extension of the big sandwich chains such and Quinzos Subs and Subway but if you want to buck the trend and buy your baguette from a local business Wolfits is definitely the place to goHonestly Im surprised Ive not got round to reviewing Wolfits yet as Im in here often enoughWolfits is one of those lunch places for office workers where you can order a sandwich a baked potato soup or a big bowl of salad They have a pretty decent selection of fillings too much wider than a lot of similar establishments which is what really makes Wolfits a good choice at lunch time Not to mention the portions are very generous a salad bowl could easily do you two lunches and the number of additions you can make is hugeMore often than not I pop by and pick up a soup I tend to veer towards lentil or lentil and bacon and 9 times out of 10 its a tasty thick soup Coupled with a buttered half baguette and Ive spent less than 250 on a really filling lunchDue to its superiority over other makeyourownsandwich shops it does get very busy around 1pm but the queue moves quickly as there are usually several members of staff on hand to help Its definitely going to be my goto place for a quick lunch so long as I continue working in the areaWolfits is competing with many sandwich bars in this area but it does a bloody good jobSelling sandwiches and paninis etc Wolfits manage to cater for an amazing variety of tastes by offering fillings from brie to salami You can opt to keep it plain and no frills or you can deck your sandwich out in loads of healthy and continental fillings They do salads with a number of garnishes too if you are looking to get some of your five a dayIf you really dont fancy being healthy they also have a huge selection of temptingly cheap breakfast rolls If youre going to go down the fry up road you might as well get a double up Go on treat yourselfTeas coffees and hot chocolates are all cheap and tasty The staff are efficient and although this place is busy indicating that its good youre not left hanging around unassisted for too long More upmarket and contemporary than a lot of sandwich bars Wolfits nevertheless offer hearty simple rolls A safe bet for any hungry citizen of EdinburghI used to make this my regular lunch stop when it first openedThe soups are not what they could be the fillings all rather dull Just not very bexciting or special if i compare to the like of BreadOliveNeeds a good kick up the backside in my opinionI spent my honeymoon in Edinburgh in September We stayed at the Caledonian so we found ourselves strolling down Rose St every day After two days of passing we decided Wolfits looked like an easy bite to eat one morning It was difficult to tell what we could actually put on our sandwicheswhere were the labels Our sandwiches were good although my silly husband thought it would be a good idea to drink coffee and put jalapenos chilis in Edinburgh terms on his sandwich before starting out our day of exploring on a unseasonably warm day Sweat baby sweatI got my dose of UK gossip as I flipped through a trashy newspaper and watched music videos on the TV This is a nice little stop if you need a sandwich soup salad or coffeeAlas there isnt wifi"

    "review":"This Pizza Express took a while to get busy but it got there EventuallyThe staff are lovely really really friendly and are happy to help I love coming here during the festival because theres such a variety of peopleThe food is delicious too  I thoroughly recommend the Tuna Nicoise salad or the Chicken Pesto Pasta  YUMMYThe service is generally really quick but I once came here before going to a concert and had to leave my entire meal  but they did give it to me for freeOverall its a great branch to an already great restaurantPizza Express has recently been a little more favoured by Anita and I They do pizzas well We arrived a little early for our reservation we sat down with a glass of very nice prosecco and some big green olives Yum On arrival of our other table guests we went over the available pizzas on the list whilst snacking on more olives and almonds Water was supplied and more bottles of prosecco were ordered Their Romana range is based on a thin  crispy base and topped with fresh ingredients I went for a blue cheese prosciutto and chicken with chili oil The taste was lovely  the chili oil was chili infused olive oil and actually dripping of the pizza I dont know if that was supposed to be that way it was nice mind but a little oily For afters I chose a macchiato this was nice and strong We had some limoncello shots and made our way It was a nice meal nothing too special I do recommend this branch of Pizza Express as the feel is a little more classy High ceilings mezzanine and glass everywhere As with all Pizza Express restaurants  they have Cloud WiFiExpensive and overrated So upon moving to this part of Edinburgh I decided to treat myself to a calzone and some Italian beer at the local Pizza Express This location has a great atmosphere overall Very chic with tall ceilings interesting lighting and cool designs throughout the building It is clearly marketed to the corporate folks who work in The Tun and Citi across the street Its a shame that the service wasnt on par with the building Upon entering I was led to three different places before the server decided where to put me Mind you there was only three people in the entire restaurant Anyway I ordered a calzone and large beer The beer didnt come out for 15 minutes When I was there there was only a few people there and three servers So Im not sure why it took so long really Anyway the calzone came and it looked good However after opening it it began oozing to the point that it made the dough soggy Ive never had a calzone do that before So after finishing half of it I decide to head out after feeling disappointed at my pricey and underwhelming dinner But there was no server in sight It would be another 15 minutes before someone who appeared to be the manager came out and brought me my bill As she charged my card she began grilling me on why I didnt eat more of my calzone and why didnt I want to take it with me She was almost offended at the fact that I was not happy with it She offered nothing to me though so her being offended meant nothing to me as a customer She mentioned something about the cook not being happy if food comes back This is the last thing I need to hear as a paying customer A threatening remark about how the cook feels about me eating or not eating all of my food Outrageous Out of fear of producing a neverending rant on my experience at this Pizza Express Ill just end it here I will not be back despite the awesome atmosphere of the building that it sits in Sad because this place couldve gotten so much of my money Oh wellThe festive menu has some interesting twists for food  drinks The mulled sloe gin was a big hit The festive menus salmon pate  pulled pork rilletes make a nice change to the usual offerings We both enjoyed the spiced Persian lamb pizzas which were huge I had to get the rest of mine to take away  thats supper sorted:It doesnt take Tastecard over the holidays but the 1895 for 2 courses  a glass of Prosecco is a decent offer Solid friendly service Its never going to be amazing but its a decentsolid 35 starsBest pizza i had outside new york periodThat might sound ridiculous but i also couldnt believe they are a chain shop The thin crust chicken pizza i chose could have been made at a genuine italian pizzeria in nycAmbience was awesome too with views of arthurs seatOk so its a chain It does what it says on the tin  you know what youre getting I like this branch at Holyrood when I time it right Too early  it can be full of kids post dynamic earth visit or tour groups staying at the hotel next door  hard to get a table They have byob  wine only on Sundays If you sign up to their mailing list you get voucher codes for discounts  as I recently received  a free bottle of prosecco on my birthday The OH ordered a pizza on our last visit  felt it was smaller than it shouldve been I think he mightve been right I had the chicken pesto pasta It was nice but lacking in the chicken department Coffee  desserts were nice I like that they do mini desserts now Aok"

    "review":"Chinese restaurants that have a dual role as both takeaway and dining venue often have to struggle with the annoyance of takeaway customers shimmying past the tables and the preconception of takeaway quality food served in a restaurant environmentKwok doesnt seem to address these issue with full success but does provide some interesting and tasty dishes  What Kwok does have however is a ability to offer some unusual alternatives to the usual Chinese cuisine regulars An interestingly spiced Eight treasure shredded duck and a dish of mussels in black bean sauce are a few of the unique offerings The menu is hit and miss though some dishes will leave to satisfied and other will leave you questioning the flavour combinationsBYOB and some inexpensive set menus equate to a cheap eat though so Kwok is worth a tryKwok may not be the classiest of Chinese restaurants but its specials board in particular reflects the quality of the experience you can have in here  The service is friendly and the food although not speedy to reach you doesnt take too long to arrive  The menu is extensive but I would certainly advise looking at the specials for something unusual to try  I went for a white fish stew which was served in a delicious oyster sauce and their tasty special fried rice  They also do a takeaway menu which is a hit with the locals and they seem to have good banter with the staff  Their prices are what youd expect and I paid about 10 for my meal which was pretty reasonable  Id come here again just for that specials boardWe were in on a weeknight back in July while on vacation in Scotland Rating Kwok 5 stars because the food was fresh and good quality despite being relatively late on a slower night with service was helpful and friendly We had a nice chat with the folks and the pace of the meal was just right for us The choices include the standards of Chinese cuisine but also some house specials or combos that were interesting Wed certainly go back if were ever in town againBefore I tried Kwok I hadnt eaten in a Chinese restaurant for about 2 years as I found most to food to be no better than a microwave meal You wont find any of that here though as the food is always fresh and good quality It is definetely not glamourous surrounds with the paper table cloths but the welcoming atmosphere and great value more than make up for this The owners are also great fun when they have time to come and chat Kwok has restored my belief in Chinese cuisine"

    "review":"I am not sure what went wrong on the day I visited as reading other reviews this sounded like a great place The decor is great and quirky and the menu looked good The gentleman that initially served us was pleasant as was the lady who took our order and served our food However the food was not good Pasta bake was too wet and much too much cheese The haggis neeps and tatties too dry The mince with Yorkshire pud was made from very poor quality mince and was probably just purchased from Iceland Worst of all was I told them I was wheat and dairy free I checked before I started eating my food if the waitress had checked and she said she had Well she hadnt as I was ill later on I would not recommend you go here if you like good quality foodI went to caf nom de plume on my own for dinner its nearly five so it can be called earlybird dinner a single foodie girl The caf is a little off the city centre but still has an acceptable and nice location for me nice location means quite easy to find it via google map as Im a map idiot From the outside it has quite lovely and idyllic wooden arch Since Christmas is approaching the arch has lighting decoration giving impressive to the passerby Once entering the caf I noticed that there are only three customers who looked like regularvisit ones Although neither the only waitress nor the female owner said welcome or hello to me I didnt mind it too much After sitting down the waitress came to give me menu and just walked away to do her task The restaurantlike menu has first page of dishes of the day and normal dishes serving everyday coming after that Although there are only four or give vegetarian and vegan dishes respectively they all look simple but refresh I ordered hummus of the day  red chili hummus with warm pitta bread and side salad 55 pounds a little pricy at first glance for me It did not take too long to have hummus served Hummus is served in a small jar with pieces of pitta bread and side salad on each side on a rectangular plate The red chili hummus tastes nice and not spicy at all but I would expect it could have flavor of red chili In comparison to hummus I was impressed by its side salad honestly due to its honey mustard dressing The dressing seems like homemade and I think it is the best salad dressing I have had in Edinburgh It tastes not strong and greasy quite fresh with little sweetness The pitta bread is soso maybe too soft and not warm enough Personally I love chewy warm pitta bread accompanied with cold hummus in cold weathers because it not only keeps you stomach warm but also enrich the taste of hummus Generally I would recommend caf nom de plume for vegetarian friends and nacho lovers The caf actually is more famous for its nachos due to its special cheese topping on the nachos Maybe next time I will try its main dish to see whether its truly on my regularvisit restaurant list Ill wait and seeA really chilled out little place where everyone is really friendly While not exclusively a gay cafe I hear its popular within the sceneThe food is nice and cheap and they have a better selection of booze than I would imagine They sell some of the rare ciders definitely worth a trip if thats your thing The best part of experience is probably most eclectic music play list Ive ever heardI know the Janes review said that this place is LGBT friendly and it is But shouldnt all places be Time to grow up ScotlandCafe Nom De Plume is essentially two comfortable sitting rooms with ample seating and a nice cosy atmosphere  The highlight of this place for me at least is the price and qaulity of the food  Starters are only 2 and their chicken broth soup of the day was delicious and filling served with plenty of warm fresh bread  Their main courses looked tasty also with bagels toasties and pasta dishes costing only about 6 each  They also have plenty of vegetarian options ot choose from so no matter what you eat you wont go hungry  My only criticism is that the service was a little slow when I was in despite it not being that busy  Nonetheless Cafe Nom De Plume has great style an good mix of customers and decent food on top of thisMy flatmates come here a lot and this weekend I decided to join themThe cafe itself was cosy and homely and although it seems small from the front there is a whole other section to the back of the building overlooking a nice gardenThe clientele were a mixed bunch of couples older and younger folk and students whiling away an hour with a good book Incidentally there is a large book shelf filled with books and table games which you are encouraged to usegood selection tooThe menu had a good mix of dishes with both meateaters and vegetarians well catered for at a fairly reasonable price My french onion soup with a lovely cheesy crouton on top was exceptional tasty and my friends bean stew looked deliciousThe only problem we had was with a veggie chilli that looked and tasted suspiciously like a beef chilli Now my friend is not a vegetarian so wasnt too concerned but as a veggie myselfI would have sent it straight back Our waitor did check with the kitchen but wasnt particularly reassuring about it all and didnt seem to believe me when I explained that veggie mince and meaty mince are two entirely different things and Ill happily argue that point with any veggie that thinks they taste the same The staff werent particularly friendly today especially when dealing with questions about beef however Ive been reliably informed they are normally quite chatty and helpfulOverall a nice wee spot to stop in if youre ever in this part of townDecided to grab a bite here on someones recommendation Nothing overly fancy on the menu just some hearty home style food Well impressed with the giant yorkshire pud almost the size of Ds dinner plate I went for the fish pie as its something I quite enjoy eating but never seem to actually make at home  Not sure if our server was new or just couldnt understand us but there was much pointing at the menu when we ordered  Aside from that he was friendly food was good Am looking forward to going back to try the Chilli Dogs"

    "review":"You know you sometimes get a gut instinct when a place is going to be good I got that vibe about The Clock and I was certainly not disappointedIn an area with cheap eating options scattered all around it can hard to settle on one of the many cafes But something about The Clock stuck out from the other contenders vying for my hungry attention Perhaps its the neo Victorian fronting complete with pillar box red paint Or maybe the clock decorating on the exterior struck me as being different from the remaining cheap or samey options But whatever it was that lured me in Im very gladThe Clock is somewhat new to the scene but I can see it being really successful For a start its chilled out nicely decorated with neutral art and cream coloured walls and is spacious if youre in with a larger group It may appear smaller on the outside but they have a secret spiral staircase taking you to a much more open dining area downstairs If you cant get to this area theres enough space upstairs for wheelchair or buggy accessSecondly along with a vast array of delicious well prepared food they also have a bottled beer and wine selection This added bonus along with the healthy portions you receive with main meals and even with lucnhtime snacks opens it out towards evening dinersThe staff seemed to genuinely care about the customers and were certainly passionate about cooking This showed in the standard of my panini which was also generously served up with chips and crispy salad I opted for the Turkish sausage and it was outstanding For a lunchtime snack it was way above par  definitely of a higher standard I also received the best hot chocolate Ive ever tasted it was perfect The girls skills put me to shame since I would definitely 3 star my efforts half the time But this one was a work of art And all of that for a fiverIts very rare that you find a cafe with such incredible choice But what really stands out is the pride the staff take in their work They went out of their way to look after their customers and the cooking was to die for Watch as word of mouth spreads about The Clock  in time this will become one of Edinburghs dining highlightsI have to agree with Marj on this one You will not be disappointed Just the sheer effort these people will go to make sure you get the exact meal you want is commendable These people are sandwich godsThe only thing I can add is when I went there was an anonymous pool of black fluid in the corner maybe 3ft across I mentioned it to them fearing someone would trip but it wasnt cleaned the whole time I was thereBetter a bad review than a bad lawsuit guysWith oak wooden flooring and pretty flowers dotted on each table Clock Cafe us an excellent choice for an afternoon bite to eatThe offer lovely surroundings with an excellent selection of all day breakfasts paninis sandwiches baked potatoes and various other hot snacks As Marj mentioned the menu is extensive much better than most cafes and the prices are also very reasonable tooThe whole atmosphere in this cafe is very relaxed and I stayed for quite a while with a cup of tea and the friendly staff couldnt have been more pleasantI didnt try to food but I noticed a table beside me with a few different dishes from the menu and they looked and smelled delicious so next time Ill definitely pop in for a bite to eatWith the addition of WiFi this cafe now gets 5 stars Great service great food cosy atmosphere able to work from there too nowCharming little cafe with great staff and even better food Cappuccino was deliciousOne of the best coffees in Edinburgh and the baristas are usually skilled even producing the odd latte art fern or love heart and the coffee is always at the perfect temperature However the food lets this place down Fairly average fair Uninspiring chilli and the baked potatoes taste microwaved The side salad is always nice and you cant go wrong with their breakfast omelette or a bacon roll"

    "review":"One day I walked past the Southern Bar to find that it was closed without any hint of it about to do so or that it was in trouble It remained closed for a long time and I always had the sense that Edinburghs Newington area had lost one of its better drinking holesHowever much to the delight of students every where the Southern has risen from the ashes had a new interior and is serving againThe interior is nice grey throughout but with odd chairs and sitting areas split across the lower bar area and the slightly raised seating areas The bar itself serves a large selection of drinks and an ever larger and more impressive selection of spirits etc grace the back wallThe atmosphere is chilled and fun and never have the staff been rude or unfriendly in all the times I have been thereDuring the day the Souther is just as well recieved with free wifi and a food menu that is reasonably priced and very tastyIts good to have the Southern back openDecently priced interesting drink menu for beer lovers as it offers a very varied selection which could even tempt me a not so much beer drinker Looks like the interior was done up recently with taste you come in and feel you are in a good local pub I know they sometimes host gigs though it was just after 5pm when I went in today so nothing on sadly Food is also delivered via deliveroo I had to take a double look when I saw the pick up actually taking place Pretty awesome Finally food for a fiver in a pub like chicken wings hot dog and fries nachos chicken or halloumi salad can make many merry punters happy Ill be back most certainlyGreat local with selection of burgers steaks and a good list of changing beers as well as varied wine list Mixed clientele students young professional and those on their ways to queens hall Always a safe betWith its proximity to the Queens Hall I thought it was the ideal opportunity to try The Southern for a pregig drinkInside its decorated and furnished in a warm minimalist style much like its sister establishments Its quite small with limited seating making getting a table difficult when its busyIts a great pub for beer drinkers They have an excellent and vast selection of local and European beers on draught and rotate them regularly They also have an even more ecletic range of bottled beers from around the world The New Zealand brewed Epic IPA would be my shoutHaving not eaten here yet I cant comment on the food but the menu looked nicely balanced and the plates being brought out looked appetising and generously portionedWhat stood out the most for me was the price I had one of their most expensive bottled beers and ordered along with a GT and glass of house white not all for me came to less than 10 Quite a bit less than I had anticipatedNewington isnt somewhere I often find myself but all of the above combine to make The Southern somewhere I would make my first port of call in the areaGreat selection of beer and the food is delicious Had a few gorgeous winter ales here recently and an Italian burger which was made to high standards I love the layout of this place because of the nooks and crannies It makes it a great place for a dinner for two or for a few friends to hang out and have beer and also for a larger group to meet up Ive had uni society meetups hereDispelling the myth of the Southside being a cheaper area in which to drink the revamped Southern extends the reach of those behind Holyrood 9a beyond The Meadows With the addition of a couple of new small tables near the bar that area is now cramped whereas in the past it never was All about getting the punters in though I suppose but Im not inclined to make the trip back any time soon"

    "review":"Noisy shared seating bland food okay service Go find a real Japanese restaurant instead of this chainIt was ok I got the pad Thai which is different from the traditional pad Thai It was flavored well but my biggest complaint was that the onions were the main veg in it and cut poorly chopped I had huge chunk a of onion and spring onions that would have been my bite alone  I might come again and try something else but its disappointing when you pay 9 for a simple meal and its not great :Okay so this is Japaneseish food in the style of a noodle shop but with mysterious added sugar in places I was not expecting it Depending on your tastes and your fidelity to the notion of Japanese cuisine you might not dig this My daughter had the Wagamama ramen noodles which came with chicken fish and various other things in it She said it was lovely and not sweet I had the teriyaki salmon soba which was nice but started to veer into too sweet for me Maybe its been too long since I had teriyaki but if its normally that sweet I cant really enjoy it The only party who was very let down by the meal was my 5 year old who ordered mini yasai yaki soba This was like a pudding it was so sweet So not for her She ate the veg and tofu off the top and pushed it aside to beg for noodles off her sister My hub had the saien soba and pronounced it a bit bland He had his to takeaway as he was home with a cold and could not doctor it with the chili oil or flakes they have at the table So overall it was fine Service was nice and attentive Im just not sure about the fusion concept I think I miss my old stomping grounds in JapanTown in San Francisco where udon noodles come in huge bowls the size of your head and there is very little sweetness involved in proceedingsAbsolutely love wagamamas Food is great I have loved everything I have had Something for everyoneThis was my first and will be my last visit to Wagamamas  When we arrived only 2 other tables were occupied  We were seated but then had to go in search of a waiterwaitress after sitting for 20minutes and no order taken The only reason this gets 2 stars is because of the starters lollipop prawns and calamari  These were very overpriced for what they were but tasty and edible unlike the main course  We both had noodle dishes one was a ramen and I cant remember what the other one was other than disgusting  Both looked like a whole coriander plant had fallen in by accident  I could still taste lumps of the stock cube used in mine  His smelled like used football socks had been added to make the stock  Upon complaining to the waitress who we again had to search for we were told we could have one starter on the house  The damage at the end came to nearly 50 even with this free starter  Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else anywhere else  There are plenty of reasonably priced decent places in Edinburgh dont waste your time hereDelicious I ate here twice during my last trip to Edinburgh The yaki soba and Ramen are so flavorful The salted caramel ice cream with banana was amazing The staff was nice both times and pretty attentive"

    "review":"Once upon a time this venue was the den of illrepute known as Priscillas  a gay bar with a bad reputation  It has now been transformed from dingy dive bar to trendy gastropub  And conveniently located close to my sisters flat  Happy daysWhen last I visited I was only supposed to be in for a couple of drinks but ended up being a great many beverages with food  Barely made the last train to Glasgow that night  I digress We ordered the orange apple  walnut salad and the gourmet cheese platter to share  We also slowly worked our way through the cocktail menu of which my favourite was probably the Iorek Byrnison named for a literary character and if you identify him you get a high fiveThe food was tasty and reasonably priced as were the cocktails  Normally cocktails of this quality are a lot pricier in Edinburgh  The staff are happy and chatty and put up with our mass cocktail nonsense  It is also a puppy friendly venue  This may be my new favourite place on Leith Walk :We hung out in this bar loads during a recent trip as it was near our Airbnb  Great place for a drink  chill vibe playing films on a TV in the corner cozy booths and friendly bartenders  Food not bad either  their meatcheese sharing board is MASSIVE and the one for  one person can easily feed 2 maybe even 3 people  Such big hunks of cheese   Not as much meat as cheese but it was all tasty at any rateWe also had a 6 inch pizza which was piping hot and had nice crispy slices of pepperoni on top  AND the chicken wings  which were also served piping hot and were actually rather good with the spicy flavor of the Cajun Spice dry rub  Two of us shared this food  we meant it to be more of a snack but it was a meal and we were pretty stuffed  If we lived around here wed totally make this place our localThis is a cool little local place for sure but the service was pretty rubbish The staff seemed way to cool to actually do their jobs The food was really good so it was a bit of a let downThis is a great place friendly service nice selection of IPAs We ducked in to get out of the rain and were pleasantly surprised We got a nip of whisky and a couple beers We shared a meat  cheese plate and left very very happy And Richard is lovelyThe Black Fox has only opened about a couple of years I would say  I am glad it took over that dingy bar it was before  It really spruced up the place and attracted more decent crowd into the Leith  The bar is has a good sized area and quite a small kitchen  This place attracts mainly hippy young locals and it is usually crowded during the weekend evenings  There are plenty of area to sit as well for food  If you get a chance on a quiet afternoon sit by the window with your food and drinks and gaze at the people that passes byI am not going to explain much about the drinks as they are quite standard  However the food here is amazing for a bar  I am never a fan of pizza and burgers when I am out eating as I think they are just a waste of money  However I was extremely impressed with the pizza  I think they have the best pizza in Edinburgh  The toppings are by far the most I have seen in Edinburgh  They are extremely generous with the toppings  The base is also thin and cruncy just how I love them  Please give the pizza here a try and I really hope someone agrees with me that they serve one of the best pizzas in town  Another recommendation is the Pork and Chorizo burger  I have always wanted to eat this again after The Holyrood 9A stopped serving them  Bad decision  They are actually the best burger I have eaten as the pork and chorizo combination makes the meat very juicy tender and full of that chorizo oil flavour  I was never a fan of the normal beef burger anyway  The onion rings here are crunchy deep fried well any never stingy on the portion  I would happily come back here again to eat comfort western food  The kitchen is so small and sometimes I wonder how they make such good food from such a small kitchen  Really delicious and good portionNice addition to Leith Walk The bar staff were really friendly and helped me choose an appropriate beer from the long list available The drinks stocked arent standard bigbrewery fare so there are lots of different options I got a Bitter and Twisted yum and then a caramelly porter that Ive forgotten the name of but it was really nice I visited the place when it was closed for a networking event It was a great space to chat away to folk and mingle and good location in the middle of Leith Walk I didnt try and of the food but I spied some pizzas and they looked mighty fine Nice vibe good decor Lots of seats Central Good staff What more could you ask for RecommendedOnly negative for me was the lack of alcoholfree beer Maybe the owners could consider stocking one of these I would recommend Staropramen nonalcohol which actually tastes almost like beer  Always good to have the option for those on the roads or just not too into getting halfcut"

    "review":"Great place for a nice meal  food is generally very good quality but can be a bit slow at times but given its location cant complain Can get very busy with people waiting on tables to be vacated but overal great food  only flaw was no draught lager when i was there Has good lunchtime deals on mealswe ordered the turkey sirloin steak and the chicken breast and waited over one hour It was a terrible experience The turkey was so dry tasted like fabric I felt like I was chewing my sweater And the chicken breast was also very dry and I am pretty sure they literally used a entire bottle of salt The steak was suppose to be medium and it looked and tasted like it was well doneReally good I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and olives and it was much better than the pizza I get in AmericaPopped in for some lunch Service was quick however my girlfriends Carbonara was a bit bland Risotto was lovely Would probably try somewhere else more local to the area next time we visitNot really sure on how to best describe this restaurant Its very basic nothing unique about it if you would compare it to other Italian restaurants The services was great basically the majority of the rating was because of the service The man who served us was very kind and generous and couldnt have done a better jobFood :A friend had ordered for me as I was getting ready in the hotel room so by the time I arrived it was slightly cold the waiter offered to heat it up for me which he did Upon tasting the food the mushrooms were slightly burnt  the chicken was fine and nothing special The potatoes tasted as if someone had thrown a heap of salt on them which wasnt that goodQuite hard to judge this restaurant as I was pretty jet lagged and very hungry So I will probably give it another chance before I leaveReally exceeded expectations plenty of choice on the menu upstairs seating and the quality of the food is a lot better than some other well known Italian food chains I have been to I would definitely return"

    "review":"A welcome addition to Leith Walk A breath of fresh air with plenty of room good selection of drinks and capable staff Nice wee beer garden out back too  entered into via a Narnia style wardrobeIm not sure why so many reviewers describe it being full of hipsters  aging or otherwise It has a fairly 30 stylish clientele which for me is a good thing It beats the hell out of Victoria twee overpriced and loud Joseph Peirces even more twee obnoxious punters and overstyledvacant ECA bar staff and Brass Monkey full of teenagers and burgers  like an Scottish TGI FridaysI like Woodland Creatures very much and I hope its here to stayTry and organise all my nights here Its such a nice environment with a great cabaret hosted by DIVE Was in the top 10 most relaxing places in Edinburgh and its no wonder whyWoodland Creatures was ajumping one Friday Fringe evening My band were booked to close a night of entertainment and we had a rare old time Ill definitely be tempted back when Im next Leith boundWe were in a little side room which is shut off from the bar It would be just great if you were looking to host a special event or private party The great thing is that otherwise it can open out and connect to the rest of the bar This wee room had interesting decor keeping with the bar name trees and animals and a dark mysterious ambience I loved that there was also an art exhibition on display  Woodland Creatures is definitely a place for creatives We played our set and stuck around for a drink or two I went for a Bacchus raspberry beer and it looked like the bar had a nice wee selection on offer Bar staff were super friendly tooId been corresponding with Lorna from the bar in the run up to the event and she was so lovely and helpful even more so in person As someone who deals with band emails its literally the best thing ever to be met with the person youve spoke to for the last few weeks on the night of the gig Dealing with the one person from start to finish makes it so much easier and builds a genuine rapport We love playing Slouch in Glasgow for the same reason Weve played gigs where the promoter hasnt turned up and it isnt quite the same In this respect two thumbs up for Woodland Creatures  Wed play again in a heartbeatIm sure Ill find myself here againIve been visiting Woodland Creatures since it opened and its become a firm Leith favourite of mine I do tend to like quieter pubs so I like that its the kind of place you can have a cosy pint without having to shout over music or other people And cosy is the word  its pretty dark without much natural light but I feel it has a nice ambience When I first ate here I wasnt hugely impressed but I had a burger the other day which was fantastic and the menu has developed a lot since they opened In the summer they have outside seating out the front and I love the notso secret garden out the back through the Narnia style wardrobe which is a wee stroke of genius They started off with a fairly sparse but cool decor but theyve added lots of woodland themed touches over time and usually have some local artists work displayed If you havent been since they opened give it a another tryWas in there last night and got a large portion of spicy chicken wings and they where absolutely terrible  Dont buy them Looked like they had been pulled out a binFeels a bit hipstertastic to me in this joint My glass of ginger beer cost me something like 275 Ouch Pub also feels quite dark and seats are not the comfiest Im all for cool options and Leith deserves to have a place for the hipsters to hang out So fair enough Theres nothing wrong with this place per se its just not really my bag"

    "review":"Possibly too popular at the weekend stag parties etc but midweek not a bad option for watching football as theyve a large projector screen as well as a few good sized tellys On the down side its one of these places that feels the need to drum up custom after 22:00 by hosting too loud covers bands of varying quality Nice  central though so at that point you can easily make your way to an alternative establishmentFinnigans Wake has recently reopened after a long and frustrating year It was closed down and had to go under a major refurbishment after a fire in restaurant next door Alas the bar full of Celtic memorabilia and coloured in green dcor and wooden sitting areas was no more However this week I entered the new reincarnation of the pub and it has gone under a radical transformation The old pub full of history and memories is gone replaced by a pub which is full of wood and fits into the categories of Irish themed bars that are alike in every major city in the worldInstead of the bar being in the middle the bar is now on the right hand side looking modern and fresh In the middle there are large high tables for groups with padded seated areas on the left hand side of the bar Further seating is in the backThe pub has live music every week it claims but even though it has this I feel with this refurbishment Finnigans has lost its old looks and atmosphere The bar is lacking that individualistic character that makes pubs what they are The place was quiet and empty the staff were new and obviously will improve with time It was quite bland compared to the bar before the fireIts due a visit though after this long closed it will be visited by people who often paid Finnigans a visit So raise your glass to the memory of Finnigans of oldI spent a great new year in here a few years back The year when Princes St was closed because of the wind  20067 I think it was Since then Finnegans Wake has been through rather a lotA couple of years ago I remember waking up to the news that Kushis my favourite Indian in Edinburgh had burnt down and the buildings either side were ruined by smoke and water damage One of those was my favourite club in the world The Liquid Room which has now reopened and is EXACTLY the same  hooray and the other was Finnegans WakeSo its nice to see that both those places are back on their feet And Finnegans Wake is just the same  its an Irish bar that has a live bands and sports and Guinness and stag parties Its a fun place Everyones your mate in here Not a place to go for a quiet drink but great fun if youre in a big groupWe were in Edinburgh from the US on vacation and stumbled on this place The bar staff was awesome Very friendly and after a couple visits they greeted us by first names Only downside is I wish they served chips or something actually the salty snacks make for more beer sales This is my favorite barpub in Edinburgh and hope we can make it back there soonIve met up with friends here a few times for some postsemester festivities and I have to say that there isnt much great about this place which is sad to meI say that because it could be a decent place to enjoy a pint listen to some music and enjoy time with friends Heres the rundown on what occurs at Finnegans based on my experiences there:1 The live music is fine but talking to others at this pub is tough to do because it is so loud This makes the pub less enjoyable to me It is hard to talk to people there  2 The doorman is a bit rude He was decent toward me and other white people at the door but to my Asian classmates not so much He seemed to take pleasure in giving them a hard time before letting them in Or turning one away for something minor while letting the local lad in who violated the same rule in with no qualms just a few seconds later That isnt right 3 Getting attention at the bar is quite a task This place WILL serve locals first no doubt about it You will get served but it will be last At least thats my experience 4 The seating is sparse for a pub A few stools some tables but really the booths are the best place to sit That is if you get your hands on one Also they are closest to the music so yeah talking when live music is playing will be hard to do5 Aggressive local drunks putting their hands on me or trying to bait me into a fight telling their friends that I am talking about them while pointing to me For the record I NEVER talk about anyone let alone someone Ive never met Mind you this situation has happened to me EVERY time I have been thereNo kidding Luckily I am able to defuse the situation but the local lads must not be fans of any nonlocal folks taking over their pub In the end this is a disappointing pub to me I hate writing reviews like this but feel like I have to be honestUn pub irlandais excellent Super convivial de par les grandes tables en boisVraiment vivant bonne musique et bonne ambiance"

    "review":"Popped in last night for the first time a really impressed Had the Cod taco which was excellent and the chicken special which was pretty good too Both the guacamole and salsa were fresh and well prepared Only the chips were ordinary Finally friendly helpful service made for a great eveningPros:  BYOB Limited seating gives the place a cozy atmosphere Good quick service  No frills menu makes it pretty straightforwardCons Tacos are actually quite small Sides are actually quite small Desserts are actually quite small Food is actually quite priceyIndifferents Tacos were tasty but they didnt blow me away All in all I had a nice time at Bodega but Im not sure Id be back The food was good and I enjoyed the atmosphere but I felt a bit underwhelmed with it all I am focusing a lot on portion size here probably because when I arrived I was beyond starving My dinner cost me 20 in the end and felt it was a bit too expensive for not being all that full Maybe Im just a megapie and total cheapskate but think the pricingportion sizes needs looked atMmmmm  I really liked this place Having had great Mexican food in the states before Ive been searching for something to fill the Mexican shaped void in my life Bodega have really unique and creative taco flavours which are truly yummy and not too expensiveSlow cooked maple pulled pork was a scrummy and the fried cod had a lovely crunch The coconut and ginger chicken was also lovely  and a great mix of textures with creamy sauce and crunchy cAbbageMy only complaint would be spice level  the chicken was the only taco with a mild spice the other two lacked any Not that this would be an issue if the hot sauce provided at every table was actually spicy Despite being warned of its heat it was literally HeatlessBut for a lovely atmosphere a tiny bill and a cheap BYOB deal  this is a great location for a weeknight casual dinner that wont break the bank :Really good Mexican food good guacamole and tacos crocodile avocado dessert tart is really interesting and tasty Also accepts credit cardsDelicious tacos Tacos are the one and only main but at the same time the different choices are fantastic The pulled pork with pineapple salsa was probably my favourite tied with the prawn tacos I was really excited to see chicken mole tacos on the menu but they were a bit light on the mole although still very tasty The beef ones were good as well but they were my least favourite of the four I tried since they were a tad spicy for mePlates come with two tacos 6 for a pair but it is recommended to have two pairs 11 for a proper meal The quality is high and the tacos are flavourful and delicious Two tacos really wont be much more than a snack since they are so small but then again four tacos certainly are filling That said four tacos with no sides and such feels a tad overpriced for 11 considering what you receive relative to other place for an 11 or 12 full dinner The tacos are delicious and the place is endearing though It is also BYOB and you can purchase drinks at the corner shop so that is quite convenient especially if coming for dinnerAlthough the Bodega is pintsized I really like the feel of the place and the intimate atmosphere It is a great new trendy place to spice up Leith Walk tooit was only while adding some new photos to Bodega that i realised i had never updated my review  i went not long after Bodega first opened and the place was constantly busy but ive been back a number of times since and the place remains constantly busy although less so on week nights  so my original one star deduction about being rushed off my table no longer stands true  every other time ive been weve been sat for ample time not once hearing that the table is needed back  and on my birthday we sat there a fair amount of time after the restaurant had closed without the server saying anything to us :the value of their menu is probably what also bumps this up for me  for my birthday i had a booking for 9 people and they offered me a set menu selection of starters two pairs of tacos each for main selection of desserts and byob corkage included for 20  seriously good value as we got a ton of food to share and had quite a few bottles on the table  i just went for their xmas menu which is the same idea except 25 instead of 20but i guess its christmas so prices go up a bit  still though an xmas meal for under 30 that included 4 bottles of prosecco is seriously good valuei love this place and will definitely keep going back over and over again i just hope they do the sloppy jose special often as tiny perfectly fried quails eggs are amazing :"

    "review":"Compared to some of the other takeaways and restaurants on Leith Walk Taste of Italy catches your eye with its large glass front and colourful sign  Further its situated right around the corner from the Playhouse and so does a roaring trade both before and after shows  I came here about two months ago and was impressed by how clean and fresh it is inside  It feels like takeawaycomecafe inside but there is only table service which is provided by friendly and welcoming waitresses  As the name suggests virtually all the food is Italian with plenty of different pizzas and pasta dishes to choose from as well as burgers with chips  I went for the penne al ragu which was pasta in a rich tomato and meat sauce  It didnt seem to take long all to be prepared was served in a generous portion  My mate ordered their margherita pizza which looked like it had a thin crispy base and a thick cheesy topping  Including drinks we paid about 13 all together which seemed reasonable considering how good the food was  Taste of Italy is certainly worth a look for a wellpriced and tasty meal with good serviceVery nice to sit here eating a margherita and a slice of cake You can either sit on the back or up in the front and look outside and that particularly suits you if youre by yourself as I was the other night The prices are not bad and some of the waitresses are Italian which makes it feel even more authentic given that the pizza itself is not bad at allvery disappointed by my experience at this place unfortunately the matter was to do with the rudeness of staff Came in on Wednesday the 9th of july at 945 There were 2 female members of staff waiting on the floor the brunette younger waitress was extremely rude when i asked if it was possible to sit in a booth as she was practically forcing me to sit on one of the high stools Im not sure if this was an inconveinience for her or whatever but she did not say anything she just looked at me like i was a piece of dirt and then moved the cutlery from the space i wanted to sit in a rude manner she did not speak to me at all not a peep but instead rolled her eyes at the other blonde waitress Extremely rude did not feel welcome in this eatery and decided to leaveIve been here quite a few times and have had a nice time Tonight however Ive come away very very disappointed We had hardly any interaction with the staff other than them taking orders and payment I requested no parsley on my pasta as personally I cant stand itmy pasta arrives and of course it has parsley in it I tried to make eye contact with a waitress to at least prompt her to come over and ask how we were enjoying our food but no such luck and I really didnt want to cause a scene  My boy friend had the mac and cheese which was very dry and overly creamy to the point it made him feel a bit sick So overall service was really bad and the food was not the bestI dont find a Taste of Italy to look as Italian as it may like but if youre looking for a quickly whipped up satisfying pizza then chow down on what this place has to offerConvenient and styled like a modern fast food establishment with a few booths included so you can sit in A Taste of Italy is a pretty tasty option if youre looking for takeaway in a hurry It pulls a lot of its business in from the neighbouring Playhouse and from people making their way to and from workInterestingly this place is owned by the man who is behind the absolutely delicious Vittoria restaurants Its proof you shouldnt judge a book by its cover since I find the exterior to look more takeaway than culinery delights But I appreciate that Crolla is attempting to move in a different direction and it opens up his highly acclaimed business enterprise to another audience This platform does the job nicely  all the quality of the Vittorias cooking but lower prices and a different pace of service If I stayed within a mile of this place I would happily become obese But considering I dont I satisfy my cravings when Im through at the theatre Bella bellaI wasnt sure if I could take this restaurant seriously as I felt the modern building as well as the name were quite dubiousSo I was pleasantly surprised when I finally went in last week The first thing that hit me were the desserts Theyve got a whooping large variety and the presentation is so great I considered cleaning the counter out bank robbery style Taste of Italy cringe has been open for just a few months and it does indeed have that smell of fresh enterprise The menu is extremely varied and though I only grabbed a dessert to go how can one resist a profiterole CAKE they also serve breakfast pizzas saladspasta paninis and burgers I suspect theyre trying to stand out from the numerable Italian restaurants in the area as there is something a bit younger and livelier about the colours and design of the place Personally Im more of an old soul but the food here is great Did I also mention cheap"

    "review":"Had dinner here last night with 2 friends and was very impressed How they manage to produce 3 courses of such quality for 1495 is a wonder Service was always efficient and polite and mostly timely The occasional cobweb in view and the misspelling of California on the wine list were minor quibbles All 3 of us began with the Goats Cheese Crumble w Beetroot For main I had the Turkey Fillet ordering a sidedish of veg with this might be a good idea for some whilst the girls enjoyed the sirloin on one hand and the Pea Risotto on the other To finish I plumped for the Banana  Peanut Cheesecake which was an acquired taste but I certainly got what I asked for and the portion size rivals Howies famous Banoffe Pie The Chilean Cab Sauv I washed my food down with was a decent little number too half bottle 12 Definitely one to go back to Stopped back in here for Afternoon Tea at the end of last week Good vfm at 1495 like most hotels the bar prices are steeper than average though but could have done with jam to go with the scones  cream and I imagine there are probably other places in town that have an edge over it for this sort of thing If you go though take the option of having it in the garden at the rear as its much more chilled than the bar or lobby"

    "review":"If you want to Chinese food in Edinburgh it is the best choice in my opinion The restaurant is quiet but i heard it is different what Chinese tourists are here clean and waiter is kind Food is very good I ordered several foods but there is no food disappointing meDisappointing experience Extremely slow service and disorganized wait staff Inordinately long wait for food to arrive Everything served tepid and flavors flat I expected better in a worldclass city with discerning clientele Not a spot I would return to or recommendWe went to Kweilin on the recommendation of an article in the Guardian The space is fairly traditional for a Chinese restaurant and not much to write about The food  in particular the seafood  was fresh and nicely prepared The service was friendly and quick The paper prawns were very tasty and meaty Both the hot  sour and the crab  corn soups were delicious The mains of Cantonese chow mein the Eight Treasure duck and steamed sea bass were what you would expect from a good Chinese spot All this being said 100 for 3 people is just insane for Chinese with no drinks I liked the food but the value for money is just crazy Ive had equally good  if not better  Chinese food elsewhere for half the price Not sure when Ill be in Edinburgh again and I doubt I would go backFirst visit to Kweilin and it was enjoyableIm not sure I was totally blown away as I know other people are Having eaten in China Town in San Fran and having my pick of about everything on the menu as they didnt use wheat flour Im GF then there were lots which were wheat based that I had to miss out onI could have the crispy duck yum but minus the pancakes as they use the mixed wheatrice flour ones rather than just rice paper rolls The chicken and sweetcorn soup was delicious as was my chicken and cashew nuts with boiled rice I made the mistake of not checking about dessert  it was advertised as apple in caramel and I thought yum Until it came as deep fried balls of apple covered in wheat batter and covered again in caramel It was delish looking but totally off limits so the rest of the table tucked in So there are good options food is reasonably priced on a par with other restaurants of this quality and the set menus are good value  we had the crispy duck which was soup and prawn crackers crispy duck choice of mains and tea or coffee at the end 25 ppThe wine list was ok too  started off with a malbec and then moved to pinot grigio with mains and both went well with all our dishes So I wouldnt not come on the basis of the overall wheat base of the food but I would be aware that my options will be a tad more restricted than other places Ive experienced beforeThe Kweilin is one of the classic old gentleman of the Cantonese restaurant scene in Edinburgh having been around for years to bring its traditional service and menu offerings to steadfastly loyal Edinburgh dinersOk so it isnt the edgiest most high fashion establishment to elegantly eat your noodles who I am kidding theres nothing elegant about my chopstick technique but what it doesnt have necessarily in the trends department it makes up for with a consistently high standard of food and very professional staffThe dishes here follow a very classic Cantonese menu route so all your old comforting favourites are here from lemon chicken to the everlastingly good Chow Mein and a good old helping of crispy Peking duck and pancakes I always eat too much when I come here and somehow after eating the equivalent of about six main courses I still manage to consume a wholeheartedly calorific banana fritter at the end of it all TremendousSo far my favourite Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh If they would only deliver their food to me I would eat from here about 3 times a week Ive only eaten in once and although as Cheryl said its nothing edgey or high fashion the service was brilliant and the food was as always FANTASTIC Ive lost count of how many times Ive gotten takeout from here but its been on point everysingletime Ive had a variety of dishes from fish  tofu in a claypot to the more mainstream sweet  sour chickenpork and have not found fault with any of the dishesWell worth a visit"

    "review":"Much like the whole of Princes Mall the food court isnt anything special The only thing it has going for it is its convenient location to Waverly Station so if youre in a rush you can nip in and out before jumping on your train In my case Ill usually nip into SpuduLike which I think is the best of the bunch the food court has to offer and I can never turn down a baked potato with beans and cheese MmmIf spuds arent your thing then you can choose from the almighty Harry Ramsdens McDonalds Subway KFC OBriens or Costa Take your pick The main downside is the fact that this place feels like the most depressing shopping centre in the world so I wouldnt choose to eat here if I wasnt in a rush because its not the nicest place to spend more time than you have toI will say if you just around for a very quick shop this is the place for you New look  gleneagles Joy among others I rate this a 3 as Ive been using the centre a lot lately as that just happens to be where the social case of where my fluttering by has beenThis place is just your typical food court in a typical mallshopping centre It has a good selection and is located right in the heart of Edinburgh with great transport links just a few steps awayThere not much to say about it to be honest it really is just as it says a food courtSometimes the best way to appreciate life is to take yourself to the very pits of it and just revel in the sheer destitution Princes Mall Food Court may be a bleak depressing and foulsmelling experience all rolled into one but its also quite unforgettable for those same reasonsEffectively a collection of chain fast food joints surrounding a sprawling mass of cheap late 80s tables the first thing youll notice is that the punters are all under 16 or over 65 Those that arent are rarely in possession of all their limbs or teethIm not the type to snicker at fast food to try and convince both myself and others Ive a shred of class so I can appreciate the outlets here for what they are and to some extent enjoy them Its just the customers that make it difficult Every time you look up you will definitely catch a glimpse of someone whos appearance and  or eating habits puts you off your lunch so your best bet is just to keep your head down and get on with it This can actually make your saturated fatladen feast that bit more enjoyable as youll likely concentrate solely on the eating to blank out the misery of your surroundingsIt stinks too Really bad Yet it has to be experienced at least once preferably via KFC or Harry Ramsdens SpudULike looks very tempting as well and Ill go for that one next time I can muster up enough selfloathing to set foot in hereJust a busy fast food area Nothing special really unless your looking for some grease and fat for the arteries Just ducked in to buy some coffee which was not that good anyways Just needed the caffeen to boost moral Otherwise I hardly go in here unless I have to use the bathroom which cost 30P or so btw so make sure you have change on hand Other then that really there isnt much to say about here Gave the 2star cause the place was clean and so are the loos"

    "review":"I have been to the Lothian location three times well actually twice and an attempted third time The first time we went the service was awesome and the food was great We even went onto the Odeon website and left positive reviews for our waiters as we had two They gave us a stamp card where if you buy 4 pizzas you get the 5th free We actually bought three pizzas in that time but said they could only give us two stamps We were okay with that The second time we attempted to go but just as we walked in the woman at the door said they were closed We looked around and there were people who had just sat down and still looking at menus to orderThe third time we went which was this evening Aug 9th they staff were initially really nice The first server was extremely nice she had a strong Italian accent so it was a bit hard to understand her but still very friendly however she must have been cleared to go home because after taking our order she was not seen again While we waited for our food another waiter was talking to the cooks and complained about how she was just about to close out to go home but then a bunch of people walked in and so she was forced to stay I get that you want to go home but this should be a conversation out of earshot We had a voucher that was buy two meals and get a carafe of wine for free I didnt realize it had expired but the manager brought it back to us and said sorry this is expired literally tossed it on the table and walked away before I could say anything I felt that she was trying to get out of having to talk to me about it Finally our food came delicious as it was the first time we ate at this place however while we ate the manager stood talking to one of the other waiters and said their sales were down and they needed to double it which would require at least five more tables I dont think this was a conversation customers should have been able to hear We finished our meals and a third waitress came over to ask if we wanted anything else When we said no and just the check she seemed disappointed When she brought us the check just like the manager did earlier she sortof tossed it on the table and seemed to be trying to scoot away quickly I was able to catch her and showed her our stamp card My friend asked if we could again get two stamps since we ordered two pizzas She very rudely replied no it was one stamp per person per order and started walking away I said that the time before we were given two stamps Again in a snotty rude reply she said that shouldnt have happened She stamped it once and then after returning it to us she went to the manager and started telling her how we wanted two stamps That is another conversation that should have been out of ear range Before leaving I let the manager know that her comment about sales being down might be helped if her staff were a little bit more friendly I always like to leave reviews when service and experiences are good I never really comment about bad experiences unless it was as bad as this one We just felt like we were a bother to this manager and staff one duty tonight This is a shame as our previous experience was so good We actually left saying that we wouldnt go back to this location again and I likely will let people know that they may get great food but I can not say the customer service would be up to parI like Croma for their pizza  drink meal deal 799It is near my work so is often the choice for a works lunch outingYou can book a table and preorder if there is a big group of you and you are on your lunch hourThey accommodate my veggie requests like using a different pizza cutter for my veggie pizza than the meat oneTasty pizzas and the staff are nice tooI hear good things about their pizza but so far weve only visited Croma for breakfast Im no poached egg connoisseur but what I sampled was outstandingly good and far better than the other poached egg dishes Ive been served on my travels around EdinburghThe place is located in the former foyer of the Odeon Cinema the cinema remains but with its main reception now downstairs so Im not sure the decor will appeal to everyone but I thought it was very smart with a nice open kitchenOne of those really unlikely places that offered a very pleasant surprise Id make a breakfast visit to Croma a prioritySo overall we said: we were really impressed with Croma The value on offer is excellent with the omelette coming in at 3 and the poached egg dishes at 4 Well be back to try their pizzas at some point but next time youre looking for a good egg breakfast in this part of town wed recommend that you visit Croma"

    "review":"Brunos Diner opened about a month ago It markets itself as an American diner that is open from 7am to 7pm The owners said that there was a gap in the market for sitin breakfast food so they decided to open their own diner Its located in the heart of Tollcross where the Two Thin Laddies used to reside I visited on a busy Saturday afternoon It looks like a stereotypical American diner  checkered floors black and white high bar stools and waitresses in 50s outfits The menu consists of pancakes omelettes french toast and typical fry up eats My boyfriend had the Big Smokey and boy was it big see pic I uploaded He says it was really good  def lots of meat I had a smoked salmon bagel with capers onions and tomatoes It was quite standard I found prices to be a pound more expensive than what I would typically pay elsewhere and for the area Our waitress was friendly and seemed to maintain her calm even though it was really busy Brunos Diner is alright As its fairly new I am sure they are just getting to the sway of things Ill revisit in a few weeks and perhaps order something more breakfastyDespite having been open for barely a month this place has at least one very shoogly table which I had the misfortune to choose  cue tea all over it by the end of the meal The menus also already looking a bit seedy  price corrections in pen spelling errors etc as well as the meal options being arranged slightly oddlyAn earlier reviewer has commented on food prices being around 1 higher than youd normally expect and Id agree with that although the omelettes we had were both good and filling if a bit salty by the end  possibly due to the type of bacon used in the Mississipi and the Oreo milkshake was as firm as you could hope form Many of the other dishes sounded very tasty as wellService was good and you can expect to be asked a number of times how youre enjoying the food"

    "review":"This is a great Thai and Chinese restaurant on Leith Walk which is very popular with the locals and after eating there a few weeks ago its clear to see why  The interior is inviting clean and fresh and the service is friendly  Further the menu is clearly laid out and divided into the Thai and Chinese sections which gives you absolute clarity when choosing what you want  I opted for something called a Gang Pa Gai which is a Thai jungle curry with a mix of chicken and vegetable  With this I had egg fried rice and and a bag of prawn crackers  The whole lot came to about 8 which seemed a lot at the the time and whilst it took a while to arrive it was definitely worth it  The curry was delicious and creamy with a huge range of spices and flavours  There were some massive chunks of ginger in amongst it but this just intensified the punch of its overall flavourApparantly delivery from this place can take over an hour so Id recommend you pick it up yourself  its worth itFirstly I have to say  the Silver Bowl is one of the cheapest Thai Chinese restaurants I know of  a really decent meal for two with all the trimmings will set you back only around 12  which in my opinion and when you consider how awesome the food is is one of the best damn deals aroundI always opt for the same thing here the red thai curry  its amazing and I strongly reccomend it The restaurant itself is clean and welcoming with a hint of traditional decor as well as some mega friendly staffStill hunting for a new Chinese goto since our favorite local closed This is better then the other two weve tried in the surrounding block of Leith Walk but it still didnt blow me away I am a severe traditionalist and always order sweet and sour chicken to judge the place and the sauce here is a ginger explosion It was alright but no where near sweet and sour The kung pow noodles were good but again wasnt blown away You can order online which is nice and easy and then go pick it up assuming they might do delivery The staff was nice when we picked up our order my main gripe about this place is they are fairly pricier then other Chinese in the area Although they do have lot of options for any interestI think if you cant be bothered to cook and you just want some Chinese takeout this is the place but it wasnt a wow for me Good but not over the top yumSilver Bowl   Chinese  always friendly fast  speedy home delivery of delicious food  keep up the good workHowever  Silver Bowl  Thai AVOID Ordered once in the takeaway and waited over an hour  Braved them again and ordered online After an hour of no delivery called  eventually answered they hadnt taken the order off the system hadnt even started and didnt seem bothered Eventually apologised and offered 10 off  Easier solution  dont bother stick to the Excellent Chinese avoid the shambolic Thai side of this chainVisited friends in Edinburgh for a night out so decided to look for a Chinese takeaway in the leith walk area of the city beforehand Stumbled upon this modern Clean newly decorated and busy place on the Main Street Not overpriced quick service and the food was absolutely scrummy  We had a mix of king prawn in black bean sauce chow mien orange chicken shredded pork dish noodles and duck  And everyone almost licked the plate Yum Only thing was No free prawn crackers or spring rolls for a takeaway over 20  Hmm  Not the end of the world but the only reason I didnt give 5 stars  Apart from that It definitely looked the most appealing Chinese on our drive down Leith Walk  Id recommend it if youre in the area  Really delicious  XxWeve recently moved near the area and as you do when you move we needed some take out If youve read any of my reviews youll know my OH is allergic to nuts so we are very careful about getting take out and have spent two years just simply not doing it probably better for our waistlinesWe decided to walk across the road and try Silver Bowl I had delivery from there about 4 years ago and didnt think I was that impressed but that may have been the delivery company We walked in and were not only greeted by very reasonable prices quick and friendly service  they were fine when we asked about nuts in the recipe and when we got home to dig in  it was absolutely fantasticMy meal consisted of the sweet  sour prawns in batter with fried rice and my OH had  chicken  oyster sauce Both were delicious and just the right size portions  we werent left hungry but werent feeling ill either  which is a plusLooking forward to going back"

    "review":"First off as others have mentioned: cash only Its a bit of a walk to the nearest cash machine so fill your wallet before sitting down to orderWe were caught in a typically grey and rainy evening in the middle of Festival season searching for somewhere that was both open and not fully booked From the outside Empires looks every bit as hipster as it truly is Slightly run down and tacky but emanating a warmth and friendlinessWe were seated upstairs in the somewhat claustrophobic loft with low ceilings and not much air to breath but it was comfy and casual The service was quick attentive and friendly  one of those restaurants with a student kitchen kind of vibe to itThe food is good if not great We went for the vegan platter and the hot platter which was more than enough food for two people This need to order one platter each means that the price climbs pretty quickly and Id say its somewhat more expensive than its worth The variety is nice though with several types of Mediterranean meats cheese salads dips and so on I do wish the pita bread was more fresh thoughIf youre looking for something thats not a pub or somewhere where you can just sit back and relax then you could do worse than Empires Four stars for the service 25 for the foodFirst things first Before you take a seat you must realise that this place is cash only The nearest cash machines are RBS on North Bridge or the Tesco on Holyrood Road Both a good 5 min walk awaySo after a detour to get cash am I the only one that is over reliant on the plastic in my wallet we returned to a cozy table in the corner Except the staff kept opening the front door to get rid of the incense smoke  each time I was hit with an icy artic blastIts byob which is cool Neither I nor the new Mrs G were drinking She had the mint tea  I tried the pomegranate juice Both were fine Water was presented in a lovely silver jug Food wise we each opted for a 3 dish meze I had the chicken the meatballs  the olives Mrs G had the halloumi stuffed peppers  something else I cant quite remember What we had was nice  tasty We werent told that they were out of pitta so it was a bit of a surprise when our plates arrived with some brown bread Not what I was expecting  no commentacknowledgement from the waitress eitherUnfortunately the bread had seeds in it which Mrs G cant eat allergies so I asked if we could have an alternative The waitress was polite but adamant they had no pitta  even when I asked if they had anything else Eventually I spoke to another member of staff  eventually we were offered some rice Fair enough Too much palaver though It shouldve been much easier to sort outThats why it only gets 3 starsIve had my eye on Empires for some time A little narrow door sometimes perennially feeling like the place is never open But open it was on a dark and cold Sunday night and what a warm welcoming space it is for a Scottish winter Its a cafe serving Turkish mezze  your standards  hummus baba ghanoush falafel moussaka Veggie and not so much as well as more interesting choices such as crushed hazelnuts in a tomato sauce delicious thank you for asking Served with warm plates of pitta studded with caraway seeds mezze it might be but we came out stuffed We also did take advantage of the size of our table and ordered the entire menu to try the lot Overall I didnt find any particular bum notes  although I was disappointed with the baba ghanoush personally but everyone had their own opinion on what was best I loved the char grilled aubergine the boy thought the air dried Turkish sausage was delicious The parents tucked into crushed walnuts and meatballs with gusto If I went through everything we ate it literally would be everything We washed it down with pomegranate juice and mint tea Water is served to the table in beautiful metal jugs the decor of this place is just fab Your meal is accompanied by an eclectic collection of music including local artists who also perform there live from time to time I absolutely fell in love with this place The boy also known as the silent reviewer argued that the price we paid was a little steep I would argue for five mezze per person 16 quid it was more than enough for one person three mezze may be just right But for a throw caution to the wind and try everything meal it was fab Oh and before I forget  its BYOB with a corkage fee and cash only payments  be warnedSometimes curiosity gets the better of us and we just have to break that final barrier by taking a proper sitdown meal in a restaurant entirely alone Despite having a newspaper on hand I still felt obliged to explain my singularity to the guy working here via a halfhearted Im just on my lunch break I got a sympathetic nod in returnIt was worth breaking the social boundaries however and was the best lunch Ive had in a while Theres only a very limited menu of 3 mixed meza plates on at lunch and I went for the only meatladen option Grilled garlic sausages chicken i basket of flatbreads and a fantastic yoghurt sauce were all good but the rubbery meaty cheese was the star of the show Utterly fantastic especially when dipped in the sauceGreat service too Ill be back soon hopefully minus the stigmaSorry its another 1 starHaving a Festivally day to yourself involving a lot of The Pleasance is great apart from the food side of things Unless you want a burger with a loooong wait a hot dog or such youre fluffed You could go back to George Sq for the far wider array of options but time is an issue Maybe like us you just want to sit down in an actual eating establishment with an indoor toilet napkins metal cutlery glass glasses etcbut for the last 2 weeks I have tried and tried to be organised and get a booking in a relatively populated radius and been told by tired uninterested voices on the phone that we cant take bookings in AugustCant WONT surely  I do know many fine places still taking bookings Apiary Aizle Blond Hanedans but they were not close enough to make viable options in rushed shedules SOOOO why STOP taking bookings I dont understand how it is better to tell people who have chosen to call your place to reserve a place for a slot that you will not oblige their business Bookings can be taken and walkins taken and everyone will be ok surely Makes me anxious and I hate that i have to pound the pavements of my own town randomlyThe visitors must fucking hate itWe had just under 3 hours to spare and wandered in the area till Empire Cafe who had spaces Miracle With David Banns next door having a queue etc we felt lucky to get a table Years in the past this place had proved a solid option for Turkish or Greek food and my DiningOptionsAnxiety left meBut within moments we went through the shitty kind of experience that makes visitors here this month Eventually Grumpy and also brought our anxiety straight out again Led upstairs we were immediately SO hot that our glasses started sliding off our noses SOOO hot The cool breeze of outside with kiosk food seemed dreamy right awayservice ranged from dreadful to shit The menu consisted of only 4 options 4 mezze plates with different titles but ostensibly not such different offerings All 1315 in price per person yet when we ordered one we were told we had to order 2 I still dont get itThe wines were all crap and overpriced crap you can get in Tesco The servers were not close friends with effiency or friendliness The food It was sloppy rubbish On the Hot Mezze the moussaka was straight out of the microwave but the rest was barely warm The hummus was bad No seasoning had been purchased for August Probably bad for the greedyasfuck profit line they run thereThis was clearly a case of a place that has a normal menu yearround then for some reason in August says  lets get the chefs in early to make BUCKETS FULL of 10 things that we can then slop out all day to the festival fools who have no choice but to eat where there is space and totally take the piss out of them all Please Note we do not give a shit about their return business No subsitutesIts just disgusting Gives this town a baaaaad name An Amercian couple there the same time hated it An English couple left 99 of their plates paid and left fucked off No staff member cared why How shit is that SHOW THEM A GOOD TIME AND MAKE YOUR PLACE THEIR FAVOURITE PLACE No Just get them in  out quick asSAID NO SENSIBLE CATERER EVER IN EDINBURGH EVERDont go there It is a ripoff business Not an experience place and not a reflection of a real Edinburgh welcome from a real Edinburgh business I thought this sort of crap didnt exist in our Festival town any more They dont deserve toI love this place When grey Edinburgh gets wet and very grey this is a place that brings you  to land of thousand nights and the Ottoman palace by Istanbuls seaside The place is small but so cosy one wish to never leave and continue the journey along the streets lit by the moon light and sounds of a multicultural mecca Ceiling is covered with colourful lamps from the gran basar oriental carpets and pillows On week ends musicians plays and the atmosphere is rising to the corners of the neighbour hood on St Marys StreetThe food is delicious and healthy SimplyGreat place for parties as well as 1 to 1 dinner"

    "review":"Rapido is a great little chippy on Broughton Street I rate it as one of the best in EdinburghThe shop is bright clean and surprisingly for a business selling fried food not at all greasy They sell all the usual chip shop favourites like fried fish smoked sausage haggis fried pizzas and of course chips There is also an extensive pizza menu featuring exciting toppings like gorgonzola and parma ham believe me this is exotic for a Scottish chippy all of which are freshly made to order on deliciously thin and crispy bases If you fancy something a little healthier there are baked potatoes again with lots of fillings to choose from The counter has a tasty selection of traybakes and I often pop in on my way home from work for a piece of the rocky road it is gorgeousAfter burning the dinner I rescued the night by running round here and picking up Fish and Chips I was quite impressed by the shop as it seemed to be a little more fancy by the chippy and had a very extensive menu I probably would have gone for something else but I was trying to pick something up quickly and when confronted with a large menu by decision making skills do come into questionSo reasonably priced Fish and Chips picked up back round the corner home Sad to say but it wasnt much better than the food I had cremated earlier The chips were pretty damn awful so much so I couldnt eat them Coming from a carbohydrate queen that means something How do you make bad chips I dont know but Rapido managed it And the fish was distinctly average I was sorely disappointed This place is always busy though and friends have given it good reviews so I guess I went on a bad nightI consider this place the Blue Lagoon of Edinburgh Im sure somebody gives out awards for the best chips somebody give it to themLet me start with the price I was about 3 for a Chip Roll and a can of coke which I would say is about average these days They actually go through the trouble of buttering the Roll take note rival chippysThe chips are like little slices of heaven not grease what so ever and not overly salted If the potatoes could think they would gladly commit suicide in hopes of being a Rapido chipThe only negative thing I have to say is that the Fish supply is constantly dwindling and expect to find a line of people out the door waiting for the next batch to be friedThe name Rapido gave me the impression that my fish supper would be cooked wrapped and payed for within nano seconds of my ordering it  I was so wrong  To be fair it was really busy but the queue to even place the order seemed to take an age  When I finally did order it then took another five minutes to get it out the shop  This was my only main criticism however as their menu is huge with plenty to choose from in the way of traditional suppers pizzas with just about any topping and plenty of cooked sauces to accompany them  The fish supper cost 4 which was quite reaosnable considering the fish was good quality although the chips werent the best  Rapido serves pretty decent food just make sure you bring a good long book with you for the queueNow that Im a vegetarian all most chippies can offer me are some soggy chips or something coated in disgusting cheeseI actually visited Rapido when I still ate fish and tried out their fish and chips I have to say I didnt have as great an experience as some of the others and my chips were to say the least a bit greasy Oozing greese is the worst for me which is why ive more or less given up on these placesI have to agree with the others that Rapido is clean and smart a rare and pleasant find The staff were also perfectly friendly Maybe I will go and try Rapido again some day and have a better chip experiencei think Stus tastebuds must have been cheating him the day he visited The Blue Lagoon The Glasgow chain is infamous for their sausage suppers containing a squidgy 3 foot long phallus with a meat content of approximately 1 I found Rapido on the other hand to be a bit higher up the chip shop scaleIts clean well put together and with charming little nametags stuck onto the grub under the heatlamps which I found quite cute Having only had a fish supper I cant comment on some of the fancier pizza choices but my treat from the deep was very good Not a great deal better than your average chippy to be honest but size able crispy and of trustworthy origin"

    "review":"I have been to Purslane at least three times On two occasions I was entertaining business partners Choosing from the three course menu was always a challenge as all of the dishes sound very appealing The food is excellent: delicious generous portions and superb presentation The wine list is good and prices are VERY reasonable for Stockbridge The place is nice and service is very friendly In summary two thumbs up and five stars for this placeBut soft What light through yonder window breaks it is the east and Purslane is my sun It was a beautiful sunny lunchtime when we came in here for lunch and the sun carried on shining on my tastebuds as we had the two course lunch for 12 pounds What great value for such great foodWe were made to feel very welcome and the casual fine dining experience to me is all about relaxed good service with excellent quality food The service was brilliant and it was clear everyone here is passionate about good food and making every trip here specialI started with the smoked salmon blinis which was fresh rich and beautifully presented The pan fried hake was delicious and has to be up there as one of the best fish dishes Ive had I really did spend the whole afternoon afterwards finding myself just going hmmmmm at the memory of itUnfortunately we were under a bit of time pressure so Im already planning a return visit with some more time to enjoy a leisurely lunch or dinner at what is now my top picks  Edinburgh restaurantAnd the best thing You get a QR code on a card with your bill that allows you to go and buy Paul and other excellent Edinburgh chefs recipes so you can recreate the fine dining experience at home with friends and family What a fantastic idea Ive already cooked the roast rump of lamb with a herb crust for some friends But it wont be stopping me coming back for the real experience of being so wrapped in the sunshine of service and taste that is PurslaneButternut squash velout amuse bouche Smoky and goodDuck slices rareish but not too w slaw  And caramel onionsSmoked salmon and smoked trout pateMainMushroom risottofirm  and good mushroom flavorBouillabaisse but very good quality fish not tons of quantityall cooked just right Dessert Cheese plate interesting local cheesesChocolate pudding cake and ice creamloved itVery small place maybe 20 people maxdown into a basement in StockbridgeNice being at a family run non corporate place  We were the only non locals or at least non Scots  Worth seeking outWent there for their 7 course tasting menu on Friday One look at the menu and I almost wanted to do a Bridget Jones dance around the restaurant Knowing full well that my dinner partner would be more than slightly embarrassed with that uncouth and outwardly show of excitement I sat back and enjoyed the glass of Prosecco and acted sophisticated The only tell tale sign was probably the gleam in my eyes and my lack of focus on the topic of conversation that my dinner companion had embarked upon Wine I know I am in trouble when I cant focus on a topic such as wine He picked the Pinot Grigio Rose Bella Modella Italy 2011 for our meal Our servers hit the exact note of polite friendly and chatty which was perfect for the small rustic but cosy restaurant decked in charming earthy tones The amuse bouch was a Butternut Squash veloute which was sweet and creamy and the perfect accompaniment for the slice of freshly bakes cumin bread I had pickedWe then had the Sole and Salmon Roulade with Sauce Vierge which was a thing of beauty Delicate with every little element complimenting the fresh fish I could happily have eaten 10 of those and still want more We were then presented with an Crispy chicken and Asian noodle salad  Chicken that is moist and tender on the inside with a crisp and moreish crumbed exterior served with a refreshing salad with crisp beansprouts and broccoli and an Asian dressing We then had the pan fried Hake with the Vegetable Fricasse Crispy skin flaky fish sitting on a bed of vegetables expertly prepared and a light creamy sauce I was almost temped to ask for a bit of bread to mop the sauce up with I didnt since we had 4 more courses to goFor our main we were presented with a Roast Loin of Pork with Confit Potatoes Stornaway Black Pudding Pork Belly and an Apple Sauce The Pork was deliciously tender the plate so skilfully put together that I almost didnt want to dive in My dinner companion pretty much inhaled his in 2 mouthfuls We then had a refreshing Raspberry sorbet predessert and I can safely say that I wouldve happily had my tasting menu end there I was comfortably full and didnt think I could manage another bite Well that was before our Dark Chocolate Marquis with Ice Cream was placed on the table The decadent chocolate dessert sat there and stared me in the eye The dark gleaming square beckoned me to try it just one spoonful it seemed to be saying Try I did And finished it too and what a perfect finish it was to the meal You know those moments when you taste something and you can almost hear an emotional celebratory tune in your head imagine confetti falling from the ceiling with loud explosions of glitter filling the roomYeah My dining experience at Purslane was one of thoseA recent addition to the Stockbridge restaurant directory the Purslane promises casual fine dining in relaxed surroundings One of those places you might not spot until youre really looking for it it served us really good dishes and is just the kind of place we could see ourselves revisiting on many occasionsOverall we said: this is a charming place I now understand the phrase casual fine dining and for the money Id say youd be hard pressed to mix quality and quantity as wellAnita A and I went to Purslane for their 7 course tasting menu 50 pp  as we had a voucher it was half price and a good reason enough to indulge for a date night Ill have to mention that the place is small and the tables are just a little too close to each other However the music is not too loud so when speaking it doesnt travel to another table  too muchAnita booked the table a couple of days before and advised the restaurant that I had a fish allergy which she was assured would be no problem on the night On arrival we were warmly greeted and seated Directly we were explained what the fish alternatives were for those 2 dishes that contained it I was supplied lamb and I think a ham alternative The courses supplied where on queue and though looked tiny for you multi tasting diner virgins : it is supposed to be that way as these were plentiful it did filled you up We decided on a light red wine to accompany the dishes and settled on a sangiovese The courses have been described in full but I will post a picture of this as I cannot really remember what in which order  In other reviews they have described most of what we had in detail thanks Nishitaa R  and I can assure you that they were indeed very good  only one we didnt particular enjoyed was the pork dish A little too dry chewy and the green peas a little too crunchy And Everything else was well attended and presented It was a pleasure to have good service efficient genuinely interested in how you liked it and how your are feeling They left enough time between courses and provided and placed clean cutlery for every course presented is that important   Yes As after other restaurant experiences  this doesnt happen that often these days There is a cosy sofa outside to cool down and tho have some fresh air I would not smoke there as it will go in to the restaurant  In fact for smoking I advise you go up the stairs  away from the entrance  window We really enjoyed this visit and were actually well fed"

    "review":"I have mixed feelings about this place Had a couple of sketchy experiences a couple of years ago  nothing bad just a lingering feeling of disappointment  however the past few times we have dropped by I have been very satisfied with our food and experienceI generally order one thing there  poached eggs on toast and they are pretty well done In fact they do their eggs beautifully and runny with no hint of fluffliness and so for a fickle egg loatherlover like me they are great as that is just how I like themMaybe dont go out of your way to eat here but if you are in the neighbourhood its a solid findI was quite lucky in that I lived opposite Cafe Grande last year but I was not so lucky as I didnt even know it was there When I finally made it into the cafe it was towards the end of my time in Bruntsfield I wish I had known about it soonerThe menu is great Every option is mouthwatering and yummy Their paninis are great the bread they use always tastes fresh and tastes healthy even if dripping in cheese My brother said his chicken Balmoral was a bit dry but the cheesecake was amazingFurthermore they have live jazz every weekend They have a big board with all the details of their sessions and they are always busy Its a great wee cafeI imagine the average budget eater will shy away from the 720 Grand Breakfast or the 625 Nachos Grande and walk straight past Cafe Grandes charming exterior  Indeed such offerings all taste great but with so many cafes offering much of the same thing at a cheaper price youll always be left wondering why you didnt walk further down the street in an attempt to find that inexpensive eat Cafe Grande seem to neither excel at anything or disappoint with what they offer  Theres plenty of these generic places in Edinburgh and thus I wouldnt recommend going out of your way to dine hereId heard a lot of amazing things about this place from friends who live nearby so I had high hopes when I finally got round to trying it outI have to say though I wasnt exactly blown away Maybe Id built it up too much maybe the memories of how amazing my recent trip to nearby Gourmet Pasta had been were still too fresh or maybe it was just bangaverage Either way it was nothing specialBeing in Brunstfield it caters for the lunchingout types and the food wasnt bad It was just a bit boring if Im completely honest There was nothing on the menu that I couldnt order in one of our student unions and if I did I wouldnt be paying quite so much for itThe evening menu did look a bit more enticing especially as they claim to only use locally sourced ingredients and the range of dishes to choose form isnt huge so you know itll always be fresh But I just dont know if I could be bothered to go all the way over to Bruntsfield to take the risk And if I were in this area I can think of loads of other places nearby that would come above Caf Grande on my listThis great little cafe is a real find in the heart of Bruntsfield  Ive been here only once but really enjoyed it  I had a piece of cake and a glass of lemonade and it was very pleasant  They certainly have a great range of food and drink   I was particularly taken with their cake cabinet which displayed the range of cakes in all their glory  For someone like me that loves cake this was greatIm interested to see that previous reviews speak of occasionally ropey experiences of this place  My first impression was a very good one and I think Id need to visit a few more times to form a solid opinionCafe Grande is more than just a cafe it is a restaurant and bar as well The Cafe is located in the centre of the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh so it is a handy place to pop into for a bite of food Cafe Grande serves breakfasts as well as lunch and dinner and they have a menu specially tailored towards children I ordered their cheese burger for my lunch which was tasty and came with the standard fries and salad but it was quite pricey at 7 Their lunch menu includes paninis wraps and salads Cafe Grandes evening menu is more impressive with dishes including King prawn Thai green curry and Cajun spiced salmon and prices ranging from 10 to 18 Cafe Grande as the name suggests specialise in coffees and they have a wide range of drinks available They serve Illy coffee which does not taste a treat  the milk in the lattes are burnt and there is almost no foam on their cappuccinos Cafe Grande also serves Coffee Cocktails which are priced at around 6 and include drinks such as Irish Coffee and Mississippi Southern Comfort apricot coffee and whipped cream which I havent been brave enough to try Cafe Grande always has a lively atmosphere inside especially on a Sunday evening when local Jazz artists perform in the Cafe"

    "review":"This place was awesome Simple foods nice wines and beautifully decoratedWhen my wife booked this for my birthday I brought out my jump to conclusions mat and figured this would be another expensive dinner in Edinburgh 1 thanks to being in Edinburgh and 2 my belief that the Whisky Experience and Amber Restaurant were tourist traps  However I was pleasantly surprised and packed away my jump to conclusions mat for another timeDrinks The bartender couldnt have been a shade over 25 yet he had knowledge of whiskies beyond his years and mine too  I was interested in putting together a whisky sampler and sought his advice  I told him the basics of what I was looking for and after a few more questions he came back with four glasses of whisky with the bottles a glass of water and a very detailed explanation as to the different whiskies their regions and what to look for  It was a great addendum to the Whisky Experience tourFood The food was excellent and was exactly what we were looking for to top off the Whisky Experience tour  The Scottish tapas and fresh bread were a great start to the meal and were quickly followed up by our main course  I went with the lamb pot with a side of roasted carrots my wife had the same roasted pot with a side salad  My two boys had bacon sandwiches and after their food came I wondered if I made a mistake and didnt get what they had To top it off the prices were very reasonable and nothing what I expected  To break it down here was our bill:2 kid bacon sandwichesorder of bread and butterScottish Tapas2 lamb potsside saladside of roasted carrotsgin and tonic5 whiskies 1 x Drambuie 15 yr and 4 x hand selected whisky tasting selectionscarafe of waterOur bill came to 64 pounds  Now after dropping 78 pounds at the Hard Rock Cafe and getting far less for my money I was pleasantly surprised and was more than willing to spend the savings at the gift shop upstairs  Im pretty sure 6 x drinks at some other whisky bars in Edinburgh would probably set me back close to 60 pounds Finally the service was above reproach  Very pleasant very attentive and very willing to say I dont know let me get the expert  When I asked about the whisky sampler our waitress went and brought the bartender over to help me out  To me thats a true sign of a knowledgeably attentive yet humble staff  Highly highly highly recommend anyone who comes to Edinburgh take one of your dinners here at the Amber RestaurantHad lunch here with the ladies   We each had a whiskey and a meal  I dont remember the meal at all but the whiskey was smoky and a number 16Horrible service tasteless food We loved the tour but we REALLY wish we didnt do this restaurant for the food It killed a lot of time and the food was absolutely forgettableVery chill spot off the royal reasonably priced for the area Food was delish would definitely recommend the Haggis Neeps and Tattys for those trying Haggis for the first time Had a wee glass of Auchentoshan 3 Wood to cap it offGreat location right by the Edinburgh Castle Mussels were excellent as was the smoked salmon sandwich Service was very pleasant and helpful Tried a soft drink known as  Scotlands other National drink called Irn Bru  a less sweet cream soda carrot cake for dessert although very dry on outside I suspect first piece of the day so left uncovered overnight Was still very tasty"

    "review":"Usually Im extremely wary of chinese takeaways that seem too cheap to be true it usually seems like a great idea at the time until it comes back to haunt you a few hours laterBut New Garden Grove manages to defy this rule Ive eaten more takeaways form here than I care to remember or admit especially during my first year of uni as its right beside Pollock Halls and Ive never been disappointed There are loads of mains under 5 although these prices dont include rice or chips and they always have really good specials on the board when you go in On my most recent visit for example I had Udon noodles with beef in a chilli and garlic sauce and it set me back a grand total of 5 When you compare that to the price of a takeaway pizza or even a disgusting kebab you have to admit its pretty good value for moneyIf you dont live anywhere near this place dont worry as they offer a home delivery service You can also pay by card if your bill is more than 7Ive almost crawled over to this chinese take away at the most indecent hours wallowing in selfpity and starvation Situated just next to student pub Crags it was just a three minute walk from my university residence and conveniently stayed open much later than many other takeout restaurantsThe man whos been behind the counter is quite friendly but moreso to my friend than he with me I wonder what I did After tasting the most delicious meal off a friend I realized  doesnt a pretty identical version of shredded fried chicken with honey and chili extremely indulgent and unhealthily sweet but gets my vote everytime New Garden Grove is quite cheap as well so will definitely not break the bankSeriously5 stars for this place Its not too bad but definitely not worth 5 when you have Hongs to go to or at least Karen Wongs down the road Yes I will agree it is cheap as fk and foung outside the Crags and across the road from Pollock this is probably what keeps them in business as the food is pretty blandRefreshingly not doused in grease the food still lacks flavour It is bang average and whilst perfectly acceptable after a session in the pub isnt going to be a revelation to your palate Sometimes when Ive had it the noodles have been pretty hard too which is never a good thingYes it is really cheap but you get what you pay for and Id prefer to shell out a little more for much better food Save this for a drunken purchase as youre only going to be disappointed otherwiseSituated right across from The Crags pub is New Garden Grove a friendly and inviting Chinese takeaway which served me well when I stayed in student accomodation just a five minute walk away  The owner welcoming and humble and there are plenty of magazines to read as you wait for the food  The menu is extensive with all the usual chow mein and sweet and sour dishes but they also serve chips and rice in a variety of sauces for those not quite hungry enough for a full blown meal  The prices are as one would expect from any Chinese takeaway about 5 for main courses yet the food is excellent  I had the crispy beef in a hoisin sauce with their special fried rice which was delicious and I could have added prawn crackers to this for only 50p  I would unhesitantly recommend New Garden Grove forthe quality and value of its service and foodFor crappy greasy takeaway its pretty good Yelp led me here The stuff wasnt overcooked nor overgreased Simple takeaway decent food Cheap 560 for a main with a load of rice The owner suggested his black bean beef but then asked if I wanted pork instead Of course I wanted the One Magical AnimalTotally decent Nothing massively special Super nice people running the place and putting up with hordes of uni students drunkenly tromping through Filling"

    "review":"The Apartment is a little off the beaten track especially if youre in Edinburgh for the festival but the food is consistenly outstanding and although sometimes the service can be variable it is worth it for the food  Its also in a really nice location because if you get a table by the window you can watch the traffic going by on Bruntsfield Place  as a big people watcher I love thatFor the food teh menu is a little unusual in the sense that it is not laid out as strarters mains etc  They have Chunky Healthy Lines CHLs which are kebab type things served with salad and pita Fish Things Other Things and Salad Dishes  We had the merguez sausage mussels and of course plenty of the yummy garlic friesDefinitely recommend just be prepared for slightly too cool for school wait staffHad a great time with exceptional food at very reasonable price Nice atmosphere and friendly staffWe had a very nice meal  I highly recommend the white fish  The service was nice we stayed a bit late drinking and had a good desert and they didnt give us any problems  Excellent service and very good food for the value  Great atmosphere for us Americans too haha :When we were seated the server asked if wed like bread and olives  Sure why not  The reason to not say yes is because it shows up on your bill unannounced and over priced for the quality  The food was ok  The buildings modern design is fun but cold  The wine list was good and the risotto balls are recommendedAbsolutely delicious food I had the mussels to start followed by courgette squewers Cool ambiance and the staff were very nice and attentiveThis is an establishment in Bruntsfield  I ordered the mussels as a starter  The mussels although not the best in Edinburgh has good flavour and good creamy sauce  The portion is also big for a starter so it is good value I had the hake as main  Again the portion is big which is what I am happy about  However it was a tad bland and I dont think the fish was that fresh as there was a bit of an unpleasant fishy smell My friend had the salmon but she also thinks that her fish was also on the bland side  I think this is a good establishment but I think they need to go back to basics and taste their food along to the way before serving it  Definitely room for improvement"

    "review":"My dad and I were walking in the area near the Sheraton looking for a place to eat dinner kind of late after spending way too long touristing all day during the Edinburgh fringe festival We stumbled upon this place and were very happy with our luck Dad had some seafood fettuccine with a light nonAlfredo sauce and shrimp prawns folks  salmon some kind of white fish crab and mussels in shell with fresh courgettes in it He gobbled it down so fast that I have no photo  I had a squash and stinky cheese risotto : delightful See photoThe servers are so nice tooIf you are seeing a concert at Usher Hall this Italian restaurant is a great choice The lasagna was good and they have multi course deals The place is spare and the good is good not great Being able to walk a few meters to the concert was with it to usId walked past Zucca many times in the past and always made the same subconscious comment  I must go in there it looks coolWell finally after all this time I went there  but only after being invited along by someone else We didnt have a great deal of time being a business lunch where discussing business was actually on the agenda for a change so we decided to try the 2 course menu offer for 10 which I must say did have a great selection of both entrestarter and mains from which to chooseService from the staff was excellent and the meals which were served in a timely I dont have a great deal of time business lunch fashion were above average to the taste and visually pleasingAs it was lunch and mid week the atmosphere was lacking however I have no doubt that come Friday or Saturday night pre or post theatre its located right behind Usher Hall the place would come to lifeDefinitely worth a visitA lovely little Italian hidden round the side of the the traverse theatre on Lothian road Its perfect for date nights as it has a lovely intimate atmosphere and the waiting staff are friendly and attentive Doesnt serve the normal pasta options you can get at any Italian restaurant in Edinburgh No it serves pretty authentic meat and fish dishes mainly Scrummy And if you need to change or adapt one of the dishes slightly to suit your taste No problemo I also love the warmed homemade bread they provide with an accompaniment of oil and vinegar Nice touchI went here for dinner with a couple of friends I have to admit I wasnt all that impressed Yes the staff were friendly which is nice however I found the food uninspiring average and bland  and isnt that one of the main reasons you go out to eat to have good food Maybe its due to the fact that Ive been watching a lot of professional master chef lately but when I go out I expect to eat something that tastes great which I would have trouble cooking on my own Im not a good cook so that isnt hard to do  The food was just average and kind of expensive for what you got We also ordered a bottle of wine which was not cold enough  this is a pet peeve of mine I hate complaining about a place as everyones experience is different but there you have it I had the chicken maybe youll have better luckStumbled upon Zucca one night when walking over to the Traverse At the time the boy and I looked at the menu looked at each other and promptly decided Valentines The menu had plenty options for meat fish and vegetarian eaters alike it was hard to pick really what I wanted to try firstFor Valentines itself there was a set menu for 28 quid 3 courses This little caferestaurant had their delivery down pat Although clearly preprepared the food was of such high quality you could forgive them for working round what is such a high turnover night for restaurants The waiting staff or at least the lady who served us were discreet and efficient allowing us time between courses to pause but not to start to wander To the meal: as we sat down my eye was immediately drawn to the table arrangement Now I dont normally comment but on the table was a little tray of salt pepper and oil with just the smallest dab of balsamic vinegar It almost looked like a work of art in itself to match the flower arrangement and candle As it was Valentines day I treated myself as the non driver of the night to a Valentines cocktail a martinibased strawberry infused concoction with I swear a hint of herb  basil Might have imagined it but it was a delicious aperitif to start the evening I followed it up with a large glass of Nero DAvolo more of an acquired taste which arrived the further I travelled down the glass The boy tucked into a rose prosecco which was like a trail of bubbly lava going down the throat To the food  for starters I had roasted Mediterranean vegetables with rocket while the boy had wild mushroom tart I think this was the only time I felt a pang of regret for the preparation style as the vegetables were refrigeratorcold where I expected them to be even a little warm still Nonetheless great texture great flavour and the mushroom tart tasted lovely as well although the pastry was a little hard for the boys taste rewarmed we suspected We also tucked into warm rosemary foccacia oh so so rosemary good I havent eaten bread this delicious in a while and olives while we waited for our starter and took the opportunity to mop up olive soaked oil as well as the balsamicdipped oil that had so caught my eye earlier Anyway back to the main course where I had a beautifully cooked piece of salmon resting on top of a spring onion potato cake you know that goosebump feeling you get when you tuck into slowly cooked caramelised onions  well this one would have had you at your knees and sauteed spinach surrounded by a lake of creamy herb sauce The boy had ribeye steak in a green peppercorn sauce that in his words melted in the mouth and he had never had a steak cooked so well My my strong words but I believed him A side of garlic foccacia bread had us stuffed to the gunnels but in such a satisfied wayFinally we both had the passionfruit sorbet as a light finish to a sumptious meal I was expecting something sweet but this sorbet was sharp as they come and super super cold having also been preprepared frozen strawberries at the bottom were a giveaway Doused with prosecco it was a welcome accompaniment to the sharp sorbetSo in summary Zucca you are sharp as they come Highly recommended and definitely glad we chose you for our meal last night"

    "review":"Id walked past the other branch of this turkish cafe which is at the Royal Mile and was surprised to see it again on a day trip to LeithIn Edinburgh ones got the option to eat foods from so many different cuisines of the world but I was still very excited to try the food here as its the only turkish restaurant Ive come across so far If youre not that much of an adventurous eater theres the traditional fryup breakfast as well as sandwiches but the really exciting stuff is the array of mediterranean food they serveIts possible to have stuffed vine leaves moussaka and mezze platters and therere some delicious desserts such as baklava available The cafes location at the shore means that youll get some nice sea breeze and a great view to go with your food Its good to keep in mind that they are a little bit pricier than a couple of other cafes though77 ShoreEdinburgh EH6 6RG 0131 554 5502Nestled on an unassuming street corner next to the ubertrendy The Shore this cosy cafe is perfect for those in search of unpretentious mouthwatering Mediterranean fare The menu centres on tasty dishes that are Middle Eastern cuilnary classics such as Moussaka and cous cous Of course the menu includes the Scottish Breakfast favourite the fryup for unadventurous diners Naturally the sandwiches and main meals are served with Turkish salad olives and a stuffed vine leafOn Saturday and Sunday mornings the cafe is always bustling but there are seats outside if you can brave the Scottish weatherTurkish cuisine isnt necesarily as chic or in vogue or as easy to find as its Mediteranean neighbours on the high street So I was quite bemused when I first stumbled across Cafe Truva Chic it is not but authentic it most certainly is After 3 hours of ambling along the Water of Leith walkway my friend and I were in need of lunch Cafe Truva stood like a beacon on its corner and I admit it did look a bit oddly placed With no other cafes or bars around it seemed to not quite fit in But after eating drinking and relaxing there I can understand whyIt has a homely open and airy feel The tables and chairs are a bit rickety in fact the whole place feels like it hasnt been revamped in at least 20 years This isnt a bad thing It has charm And some aspects of the decoration were quite stunning I immediately liked it It was Turkish in essence and so wasnt trying to be Turkish The menu was reassuringly bizarre English translations were limited and I didnt know what half of the things were The cakes on display were unlike most Ive seen in regular Edinburgh cafes Turkish delight of course but many other cakes that I must go back and tryI had the lamb meatballs and my friend the feta and spinach pastry parcels There were real Turkish names for these dishes and Im afraid I cant remember them I feel so fake Tasty meaty cheesy tomatoey goodness Not blowyoursocks tasty like the other Turkish restaurant Ive reviewed but I think because the cuisine was cafe style rather than restaurant The side salad was presented in a dated and generic manner with a few bits of iceberg lettuce some cubes of feta and a few olives I think in comparison to the many other nouveaumed cafes around that are bang on trend it seemed a littlelacking But then my friend ordered a coffee and I was very impressed by how it came It was real genyooan Turkish coffee It came with a small cup a medium sized metal pot that you steeped for a while then served It was sweeter than normal coffee but also darker and richer Like nothing Ive ever tried And it complimented the cake we shared wonderfully an intensely sweet gooey layered honey and nuts creation Again authentic and again I cant remember its nameCafe Truva is a slightly odd creature but it has charm It is authentically authenitc rather than hamming it up for the tourists authentic It feels like its been lifted straight from a Turkish village circa 1980 that the locals visited for their afternoon coffee and cake Its not trying to impress the ladieswholunch crowd or compete with other nouveaumed joints I wouldnt say to take a trip out here just for this cafe But I would say if youre in the area go and if you go order the coffee and a sticky sweet cake And the meatballs although not necesarily in that orderAlthough it has a sister coffee shop on the Royal Mile I didnt get the same experience in this one  The staff were a little rude although it did supply some lovely goodiesCafe truva is a fit and healthy 3 if ever i saw one Big portions delicious pita OK so not really supposed to eat pita bread at the moment but the temptation was too much and generous nice salads The chicken panini was bit tough for the boys liking Stuffed vine leaves were nice the green olives that came with the salad were drop dead delicious with this buttery overtone that I didnt expect Artichoke salad wasnt drained properly artichokes from a can so there was a lot of water combined with dressing that sadly soggified my pita Definitely nice and a generous menu fit for most dietary needs Baklava and assorted sweets looked appetizing Its not a must visit but its definitely a good place to go if you need a lunch spot in LeithCafe Truva on the Shore This is one of the places that only get better and better It has been there for years in effect since 1998 It went from small Turkish offerings to the full well placed Eastern Med  restaurant chain 3 restaurant and counting I like this original shop Cosy clean and very friendly They are frequented by locals as well as day trippers to the shore It is well placed on the edge of the Shore over looking the water and it is a sun trap Winter or Summer  if the sun is out  Truva will be in it  The food is definatly Turkish with added burgers and paninis  the whole day breakfast Turkish or Scottish is a treat and a feast Not too expensive They offer free WiFi takeaway and also do outside Catering"

    "review":"GY is a pretty standard Chinese takeaway as far as Im concerned Compared to the other takeaways in Marchmont it kind of falls short But thats very possibly only because Delicious Italian and Kasbah win best takeaway hands down Located right next to Bohemia on Roseneath Place its in a pretty good spot They do your usual stirfries with veggies with black beans and broccoli or this one is one of my favourites cashews Ive always thought putting nuts in food is a really good idea and Ive always felt a lot of sympathy for people with allergies who cant partake in this culinary experience They have a couple of reasonably priced meal deals and your food always comes with prawn crackers There are plenty of vegetarian seafood and meat options here and the best thing really is the pricing Apart from that therere probably better Chinese takeaways you could go toG Y used to be my local Chinese take away so I visited here quite oftenI have to agree with Julia that on the surface this place is pretty standard The menu is what you would expect although the prices are pretty good Apart from the free prawn crackers nothing really strikes you as extraordinary about the food However I have always found the staff to be exceptionally nice I know this shouldnt sway me but it does The guy who is always behind the counter I used to know his name always used to chat to me about nerdy stuff or just ordinary stuff like how my day had been The food would also be served really quickly and efficiently The second time I went back they already knew my faceAverage food great serviceI really dont see the appeal of GY at all My friends go here all the time and rave about it saying its the best theyve had and it feels really healthy Either theres another one just around the corner which is awesome or theyre just idiots and I know which one Ive got my money on To be fair to GY it looks like they try to make their food a bit less greasy than most other places but thats about it Their dishes are so bland its unreal with a complete absence of any flavour whatsoever Its not too expensive but with food this boring no matter how cheap it is I wont be coming backSuper friendly service food made to order lightning quick and highly competitive prices  While the food may be modified for the local taste it is nonetheless a great value and each container can feed 2 people  There are days when you just dont want to cook and GY should be on your rolodex of takeawaydelivery restaurants  Living in the neighborhood Ive often passed by this tiny little store which has a waiting room no bigger than a breadbox  Usually at dinnertime its got 3 or 4 people waiting for their ordersthats why I ventured in and tried them  I think with their service especially and pricing Ill be back"

    "review":"This is such a nice little restaurant and I particularly love it because its a social enterprise run by a community of Sikh Women who know what theyre doing They apparently train more people in the kitchen to create more employment opportunities I tried the Aloo Paratha and it was delicious Ive also been recommended the Thali by a friend but I havent gotten around to eating it If youre wondering what to drink here you wouldnt go wrong with a Lassi or a Masala Chai Solid 5 starsWe went to this restaurant several times during our visit Home style cooking Menu changes daily  Staff is friendly and I believe they also have cooking lessonsNear the foot of Leith Walk this is a fantastic cafe serving great and cheap Punjabi food  Open for breakfast and lunch the dishes on the menu consist of simply homely food such as dal and chapatis or chicken curry and rice but here simple really equals delicious as the women who work here are all amazing cooksThe dcor is very plain with white walls and paper tablecloths but somehow it works and the cafe feels very light and airySet up as a social enterprise by a Sikh womens collective its comforting to know that by enjoying tasty curry you are also supporting a very worthwhile community initiative  This place has a refreshingly different and dare I say it more authentic atmosphere from a typical Indian and is definitely somewhere you should check outPunjabi Junction on Leith Walk offers the freshest most authentic and finest quality Indian found Ive yet eatenI was in the area to meet a friend for a chat and thought wed look for somewhere to have lunch and PJ was nearby do we popped in out of the rain phewImmediately upon entering one is highly impressed by the very simple almost minimalist light not too bright decorStaff were beyond patient friendly and helpfulWe both went for the Chicken Thali lunchtime special at an incredible 5 a head This included Chicken curry Tarka dal Raitha Chapati 1 each of Spicy  Plain Poppadom nano salad and rice all served on a trs chic metal trayThe food was so tasty and full of flavor We each had a can of Sprite to wash it all down with The grand total was a mere 12Were definitely popping back againThis restaurant is more than worth making the effort to visit it has a varied menu and you wont be disappointedThe only very minor quibble I had and this prevented a 5 Star rating was the Chicken Curry tasted fairly salty but not quite to the point where it detracted from the enjoyment of a fine mealThis place demands a visit The food is very good simple Indian fare and the atmosphere quiet and contemplative right down to the soothing music in the background Coupled with the fact that this is a tremendous community venture providing a focal point for some excellent endeavours I cant recommend it highly enoughOverall we said: Open from Wednesday to Saturday the Punjabi Womens Kitchen is understated bright full of welcoming aromas Its one of those places you want to make sure everyone knows about yet still retains its winning charm and always has a free table with your name on itThis allfemale powerhouse of a social enterprise is a wonder in Leith offering up delicious authentic Indian food The paratha with accompanying sauce for dipping the saag aloo with the fluffiest of rice all of it fragrant and full of flavour a real Indian feast But the showstealer was the absolutely GIANT vegetable pakora I dare your eyes not to widen as theyre placed on the table before you And they taste every bit as good as they lookService was friendly and fast Refreshingly everything on the menu and the order process was made clear to us from the start leaving no room for confusion Only the watery weak mango lassi has me leaning to four stars Other than that Punjabi Junction is an Indian delight to be found in Leith"

    "review":"K2 is a handy wee kebab house to pop into Situated in the centre of the Newington area of Edinburgh K2 is just a short walk from the city and centre and it is very close to the University so it is incredibly convenient for the studentsK2 specialise in Indian and Turkish cuisine with dishes such as currys and kebabs Their menu consists of Tandoori Indian dishes as well as the more popular currys such as korma and Rogan Josh K2 also sells the more traditional dishes too such as fish and chips burgers fried chicken and pizzas I have been to K2 several times for dinner over the years and I have never been disappointed with my meal Their burgers are extremely well cooked and havent got a layer of grease on them which you can sometimes find with takeaways The chips which came with it were also very tasty and the whole meal comes to about 3  what a bargain There is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes available on K2s menu and so there is something for everyone You are able to order online on their website and they have a home delivery service which is incredibly convenient K2 is open late so it is a great place to stop by for some food on your way home from a night outSituated on Clerc Street K2 Kebab House is ideal for students from the local halls of residence and I went there myself quite a few times during my first year  At that time they used to have a deal on called chicken chips and chutney which cost 3 and was exactly what it claimed to be and tasted great although horrifically spicy  I was back in about a week ago and theyre no longer doing that deal but theyre still offering delicious curries kebabs and burgers at reasonable prices  I went for the lamb korma with rice which cost less than 6 and tasted greatMy mate however ordered a pizza which came with lashings of grease which he had to mop up  Other than that their food is generally good and well worth a tasteThey used to have a sofa at the back of K2 A bit leather one which they invited you to sit on whilst you waited for your food Then one day I went in and the sofa was gone Now I dont see the point I think its because I and plenty of other people I know kept going into K2 ordering food then falling asleep on the sofa  this was due exclusively to tiredness you understand nothing elseI know I know its a curry house not a bloody lounge And as far as the food goes its pretty good Fairly standard but tasty nevertheless They have a quite funny offer on where you get a free can of pop with a meal But the only cans youre allowed are rolla cola and dandilion and burdock Maybe cream soda too Its also cheap  youll not pay more than a fiver for anything So all in all its a pretty good take away But it was so much better when they had the bed Sorry sofaI wanted to like this place but as a delivery option it fell short of expectations  First it took 125 hours for delivery on a nonsnowy Edinburgh evening second the doner kabab w chips that I ordered was missing the chips  the garlic sauce that it was to have come with  Lettuce was a bit on the driedold side and only 2 slivers of tomatoes were included in the salad  Third there was a curry sauce in there that had more than the usual amount of oil floating to the top  I think Id come back to give it another try since the price is fair  however Id avoid delivery and do takeaway instead"

    "review":"We popped in here for a slice a cake and ended up getting a yummy nata Portuguese custard tart  too It was a lovely sunny day in Edinburgh and by 3pm most cafes were sold out or had very limited choices of their pastries or cakes left good for them  This was the fourth place we had walked into having not seen anything at the other places that stuck us  I ended up getting a delicious slice of a double layer maple and pecan cake The icing was super sweet  just as I like it and the cake a bit crumbly because of the amount of butter in the cake It was the 2nd to last piece left and the side was a bit dry expected but the flavour of the cake was so good and the icing so rich I wasnt put off by the dryness like I normally am I would order it again because it was so tasty PLUS it was a huge piece of cake Could have easily of split it  Its a small coffee shop with some fresh ready made sandwiches and wraps a nice veggie section  and some yummy cakes and tray bake choices A solid choice for a quick lunch or some cake and tea It was clippers tea bags nothing amazing but at least a good tea though I wish theyd serve Pekoe Tea just down the street as some of the other cafes has chosen to do The BEST part of this little cafe were the Natas  the Portuguese custard tart If you have never had one of these you dont know what youer missing out on Probably my favourite part of visiting Portugal are these amazing tarts Each region makes them a bit different Outside of Portugal its harder to find good traditional tasting Natas  though Ive seen cafes trying more and more now Cafe No 33 MAKES AMAZING Natas Delicious smooth custard and a wonderful buttery flaky pastry Pop in for one of these if nothing elseFantastic lunch for a great price Good atmosphere  friendly staff and tasty snacks Would come again without doubt if Im in the neighborhood and hungryThis isnt a place that really stands out when you walk through Stockbridge though I think youd be making a big mistake to miss it as I have the past 7 months oopsCoffee is quite good and the Portuguese tarts are lovely Pro tip: ask for it to be heated slightly before eating in my youth I worked in a Portuguese bakery and there was nothing better than a fresh tart warm from the ovenIts a cozy little place with limited seating Theres a small variety of other baked goods and sandwiches available too if youre in the mood for a snack or light lunchAt last a wee day off by myself and a stroll into Stockbridge for a wander brought me past this great spot Im always a bit nervous of trying somewhere new for coffee in case Im disappointed but this place luckily was bang on I ordered a toasted croissant with bacon Isle of Mull cheddar sun blush tomato and rocket which was awesome and toasted exactly as I like it A creamy flat white coffee was the perfect companion very nicely made and presented too The cafe has a modern and continental feel chilled and relaxed with a decent selection of tunes in the background The staff were friendly and I noticed child friendly with fellow customers which was nice to see I couldnt resist squeezing in a Portuguese tart and a tea before I left and Im glad I did they were both delightful Looking forward to stopping off here again soon Only downside is the 50p charge for using credit and debit cards slightly annoying but didnt ruin my experienceThis lovely little caf reminded me of the kinds of places Id stumble upon on holiday in Italy with the most delicious sandwiches and cakes on display at the countertop And my salmon and cream cheese bagel was every bit as tasty as it lookedI didnt stay long but just long enough to know that Cafe No33 is somewhere that I can call on when Im longing for a sandwichbagelcoffee in a bright and welcoming spotStaff were friendly and service was fast Its a tad small and if you do find yourself with the only option of the back two seats theyre just a little bit too close to the toilet door which is a minor inconvenience  But thats being pernickety  I really enjoyed my visit to No33Im a bit perplexed I didnt notice this place until todayThis little cafe has been open since December which is news to me considering I walk past it almost daily Maybe its because it has a rather nondescript storefront or maybe its because I walk and tweet too often to notice sweet little cafes right in front of my dang eyes but today while walking and tweeting if I hadnt nearly ran into their sign out front I daresay I would have missed it againIm pretty glad that I didntFirst and foremost I tip the hat to free wifi Youd think this would be pretty standard in most cafes by now but its really not So kudos for quickly jumping on the out of office office list for my work from home ways Plus the place has an airy minimalistic feel with lots of natural light  perfect for those afternoons where Ive seen the inside of my house and the front of a computer for far far too longBut whats a decent wifi signal without good grub so for the sake of research I had my second lunch today here I ordered a salami  roasted tomato on focaccia sandwich and a custard tart to take away because research should always include dessert The sandwich was tasty Not a standout in any means but a solid wouldnt kick it out of the kitchen sandwich But where these folks won me was in their custard tarts I already see an addiction taking root which is dangerous as I already have a few pretty strong pastry addictions with other spots in the neighbourhood The tart was delicious without being too sweet and Id definitely suggest itIll have to hold my comments on the coffee until my next trip in I should probably have a custard tart with that too you know for comparisonCash only"

    "review":"Sunday brunch lunch today courtesy of my wife Outstanding cooking of beautifully fresh produce Where to start  The rhubarb Bellini Yes thats where we started We opted for some sharing and a main each Tagliatelle with walnuts and black pudding  crunchy and spicy  it disappeared a bit sharpish I had the hake with celeriac and amazing crispy kale  I guess it was dehydrated in the oven Simply superbmy wife had the leg of mutton equally well presented Finale was fought over with spoons Sherry icecream chocolate and some more rhubarb from the front garden Keep it up guys Weve been fans since day 2 Well be backUn menu 7 plats qui change tous les jours et qui met les lgumes  lhonneur Des produits de haute voltige une carte des vins clectique et raisonnable Le Chef a adapt le menu  nos dolances et intolrances no dairy pour lun et vgtarien pour lautre Le lieu est superbe une maison de campagne quon partagerait avec les amis une platine vinyle qui donne le ton du bon son on rverait davoir a dans le bois de Boulogne par exemple    Le service mriterait un peu plus dassurance Le prix est sage 2 menus 2 verres de vin 1 cocktail 102  sans pourboireOk so being a typical grumpy northerner I was more than a little sceptical about the idea of going to a restaurant where Id have to sit next to total strangers Lets face it what if one of thems a slurper Noone needs thatThankfully Im always up for trying anything  and this place didnt disappoint As everyones as wary of the seating as eachother its actually a very relaxed and nonintrusive atmosphere when you get in The staff are very laid back yet attentive happy to discuss all the dishes and where the food comes from If youre lucky the chefs will also pop over from their station in the middle where you get to watch them cook your food and do the same As a hospitality pro Ive never worked with any chef happy to actually speak to their diners so I loved thisTheir menu is also a little different to the norm  for dinner its just a set 7 course tasting menu Thankfully the food is amazing The menu changes every day and you get to walk past a lot of the produce on the way in as they grow it in their own garden Everything was incredibly tasty fresh and full of dishes Id never even consider if just taking in a regular a la carte elsewhere Great for curious eaters like me AND ITS ONLY 35 I can only say get in there before the prices go up  itd be worth it at double the priceI have to recommend places to eat quite a lot as part of my job and the Gardeners Cottage is always my number one tipPS  in spite of the set menu they cater for virtually all dietary requirements too The lady next to me came in and listed hers worried shed either get no food or some woeful substitute They rustled up a menu on the spot for her and she proceeded to spend the rest of the evening making noises Ive not heard in a dining establishment since When Harry Met SallyI came upon this place largely by accident and without a reservation Fortunately they were able to accommodate me but I gather that was only because I got there pretty early for dinner and was very very lucky Make a reservationThey offer a changing menu of 7 courses that is prix fixe however they appeared to accommodate a number of dietary restrictions of diners around meI got a pretty close up view because you are sitting right next to them at the communal tablesThe staff were very efficient without feeling like you were being rushed I had plenty of time to contemplate between courses while never sitting with an empty glass or finished course sitting in front of meShould I find myself back in Edinburgh and I hope I do I will definitely come back hereI made a reservation last minute on Friday for Saturday dinner traveling up for the weekend with my cousin  thought there was a la carte menu but pleasantly surprised to find it was a seven course tasting menu for only 50 pounds  every course was delicious and a revelation to look at and taste  didnt take pictures as charging the phone but you start off with homemade sourdough bread with the most incredible yogurt dip get an aubergine tortellini amazing a fish dish a lamb dish palate cleanser with herbs picked from their own garden a cheese course and a dessert course raspberry and pie crust  everything was delicious setting is intimate and you get to talk to your table mates a bit in our case a local couple and visiting Brits  service was also great Everyone needs to eat here if you will be in Edinburgh :A cute cottage with excellent food that is both delish and fresh The menu changes frequently so it never gets boring The ambience is good theres an open kitchen so you can see the chefs preparing the food However the setting isnt for everyone They have long tables where you sit next to other people you dont know Its a good setting however it is slightly crowded and personally I think there isnt enough space on the tables and they should sit less customers on each"

    "review":"Ive been here for drinks a lot over the last three years or so and had differing opinions virtually everytime but the places quirky interior and range of cocktails have always lured me back Now that the music policy and volume seem to have reached a sensible point no blaring hardcore hiphop and the rather manic head barman seems to have moved on I think it can go on to greater things And as Ive for some reason failed to review it up till now having finally sampled the food it seems time to redress that Deciding that drinking on a palindrome earned double points and having a hankering to take up the bars bottle of vodka with limitless trimmings deal half a dozen of us trooped along on 01022010 As this was a Monday night we ended up being the only customers for the bulk of our time there I doubt that had any bearing on the service but that was uniformly courteous and swift either way The bottle of Finlandia in an ice bucket at the end of the table was a roaring success and no one had any complaints about their dishes which included hare with pumpkin puree black pudding with beetroot and poached quails eggs haggis linguine and a very enjoyable cheesecake with strawberries dessert 22 for three courses if having the table dhote and the a la carte was slightly dearer obviously Well be back again on 20102010 and Im looking forward to it Visited again sooner than expected April 12th and things seem to have changed as far as the bottle to the table goes Smirnoff Black is now the vodka of choice and you certainly notice the slight change in strength Mixers have unfortunately gone from individual bottles to jugs from the gun and bizarrely Tonics no longer available inclusively Youre still probably getting vfm but less so than two months agoNeat little place off the royal mile with crafty cocktails and good food Ordered the hake was lightly flavored but topped with flavorful Ingredients They made a specialized veggie risotto for my wife which was good too Grab a cocktail here if youre nearLocated just off the Royal Mile Monteiths is very fancy pants indeed it does seem like its trying a little bit too hard to be cool with the cushioned walls chandeliers and the miniature yet perfectly presented portions of food It reminds like of a real ladies who lunch type place but having said all that I still quite like it It isnt as obvious as other restaurants in the area and I must have walked passed it hundreds of times before finally popping in a couple of weeks agoThey have a lunchtime offer where you can choose any two courses off the lunch menu plus a bottle of wine for 1095 so great if youre a lady who lunches on a budget Even though the portions are small the food is still delicious and there is a great selection tooIn addition to food they also have an extensive cocktail menu theres absolutely loads to choose from in fact one of the best cocktail menus I have seen recently The average price for a cocktail is around the 7 which I think is quite reasonable indeedA nice little find definitely a good place to visit on a girly daynight outCosy bistro in the heart of the Royal MileFantastic food in a very cosy basement setting just off the Royal Mile We were moved from our original table as it was very busy so that was less than ideal But the excellent service after this more than made up for the earlier inconvenienceThe puddings were especially yummyWe had booked for an early New Years Eve dinner through Open Table and were drawn to this restaurant because of the individual dishes on the menu When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised that they had made the extra effort and had decorated for NYE but in a classy way The photos on the website doesnt do it justice and it has such a nice vibe They have a great cocktail menu which we tucked into straight away Maybe it was just me or I just picked the right ones but they were strong cocktails Not complaining it was refreshing to see someone actually making real drinks with great flavour combos We then had some amazing starters the Crispy Pig Cheek Bon Bon was out of this world Dont be fooled by its small size it packed a punch The mains also matched up to the great starters The steak was nice and thick great quality and perfectly cooked to my preference Also the roasted honey carrots were something else My partners venison cottage pie was also nice but was more on the small side good job we had ordered the side As it was NYE we did the whole hog and got desserts Typical of me I stuck to the cheese board Great cheeses lots of it nice condiments and perfect cheese to biscuit ratio The staff were perfect that night So friendly and attentive always there when your drinks where nearing the end and constantly making sure your water was filled to the top As we had booked for an early dinner our table had a time limit they let us stay as long as we could and when our time came to leave they even offered to make space near one of the bar tables to stay longer The perfect dinner to bring in the New Year I would put this as my No1 restaurant we visited during our trip in Edinburgh A must Visit  31122014 DinnerWe just had drinks at Monteiths but its a lovely little place  We decided we wanted afterdinner drinks during our night in Edinburgh and were drawn in by the fairylights at the entrance  Surprisingly we were able to snag an open table at the bar on a busy Saturday nightThe drink menu is huge and very well puttogether  They have a vast selection of craft cocktails as well as topshelf liquors whiskies etc  I tried a drink called the mead cobbler a lovely concoction including mead bitters and pomegranate juice  My husband of course ordered Scotch whisky and was very pleased with the selection he was able to order something he hadnt tried beforeThe ambiance is fantastic and the food I saw go by looked delicious  This visit was spontaneous but Id definitely plan a trip here on purpose next time I find myself in Edinburgh"

    "review":"Well worth the price New Chapter was a beautiful experience with excellent service and sumptuous courses Best meal of my life  Roasted Pheasant with Morteau Sausage Savoy Cabbage Celeriac and Beetroot Gratin If you love deeply flavored rich succulent dining this is an exceptional place to check out Great choice of wines as wellThe welcome was warm the newlyrenovated interior inviting and cozy The menu is limited to 56 choices for each course which is not in itself a bad thing but when you are a vegetarian who is tired of eating risotto it can bring down your interest level Chefs of Edinburgh why do you think vegetarian food consists primarily of risotto or gnocchi Who taught you this How do I get you to unlearn it As the menu at New Chapter changes with whats in season I have hope that there will be more interesting vegetarian mains in future This place feels promising but not quite there yet Most of the food was tasty especially the creamsoaked kale with chestnuts Service seemed a bit overstretched at times we had to ask multiple times for a cooling bucket for our white wine but was generally good Well probably give it another try in a few months or soIve been meaning to visit New Chapter since it took over this location a few months ago but it seems to be keeping busy and was often fully booked at weekendsI came here for lunch on Sunday its a nice bright venue and when its busy it has a nice atmosphere Its a good place to come for a relaxed but more sophisticated lunch with a glass of wineI had a crispy poached eggs and sprouting broccoli as a starter which was cooked perfectly and was delicious I went for the main course of coley beans and artichoke and for dessert a brownie with honeycomb and icecream  It isnt trying to do anything to outlandish it is just simple wellexecuted classic dining The reason that Ive pushed up into 5 star territory is the price At 950 for a two course lunch of this quality it seems like ridiculously good value I couldnt fault the food or service at all and the portion sizes were reasonableId probably still come in the evening and pay the full prices which seem to be around 15 a person but once you get into that price range competition becomes a bit stiffer For a weekend lunch though under a tenner I will definitely be backIf you like plates of food that have been pured to with an in inch of their lives and all taste of rich jus then this is the place for you The place for many people Im sure I like texture flavours surprises interest some fun and personality and this traditional style bores me Coupled with a fractured service servers ranging from interested to really not really filthy glasses and 2 of the four lunch options not being available at 2pm I went without starter since remaining options didnt appeal  I just know Ill not be back Atelier theres a connection was also not really for me but I totally understand theres a customer base out there for this style of eating Not the place for me Lunch decent value if choice is thereFor a restaurant which has been open three weeks this is a very smooth operation Looked it out for dinner based on a friends recommendation as it was close to the botanic gardens where wed been for botanic lights Quick look at the menu in the window and we were impressed with the options and more importantly the price point We were greeted at the door and able to take our pick of tables Menus were produced and water brought promptly Our wines were brought quickly and starters didnt take too long to arrive The restaurant filled up quite a bit and with a large table in the atmosphere was quite lively but not too loud  Our plates were cleared once wed finished and there was a good amount of time before mains They were happy to give us a break before dessert as well All three courses were delicious everything perfectly cooked and flavours well paired For the quality of food and price top marks Would happily go back if Im in the area can happily recommend it"

    "review":"A nice wee surprise on my travels I grabbed a table and tucked into the Lamb Rogan Josh that the friendly waiter brought over to me Rice was good meat was tender and the sauce was spicy but extremely creamy The service was a little slow I realise it was a friday night when I visited but it looked like everyone else was in the same boat Great food just need to work on getting it out quickerI came here on a Monday or Tuesday evening a few months ago and fond the service was actually quite good probably because there hardly any customers  The waiters were welcoming and the food didnt take too long arrive  The food although not particularly bad was far from being the best Indian food Ive tasted  I ordered the chicken bhuna with pilau rice and Im pretty sure the chicken was overcooked but the sauce was excellent with a good mix of vegetables and spices  The rice also tasted a bit overcooked and soft as if it had been sitting out for a while  In its favour the menu is enormous with plenty of curries kebabs and vegetarian options all of which are pretty reasonably priced around the 5 mark  Although my meal wasnt the best Ive heard good reports about it and would probably give it another chanceI live almost opposite Shezan Tandoori and I have to complain about all these restaurants in the area Its seriously hurting my bank account and making the previously enjoyable task of cooking seem rather tedious Shezan which serves Indiad food is definitely in Italian restaurant territory with Ferris the Sicilian restaurant and Guilianos surrounding it However its probably what makes it as well as Phuket Pavilion right next to it a little refreshing so a friend and I decided to get take out one night We werent that adventurous opting for simple naan bread and Chicken Bhunaa which hasnt disappointed me anywhere Ive gotten it I didnt have much to complain about and Im keen to have an actual diningin experience there The number of diners seems to have picked up recently probably because were in the tourist period but this makes it look much less dodgy than I previously thought it wasAmazing Indian food in Edinburgh  Their Naan is especially amzing  Their sweet nan was so good must getThis is the best Indian food I have ever eaten The staff is wonderfully polite and attentive I went the first night I was in Edinburgh and went back 4 nights later and the waiter remembered what I had ordered I dont eat dairy and he remembered what I had asked them to make special for me I highly recommend themExcellent Indian food impeccable service in a lovely setting Highly recommend it for a change from traditional local fare which is also excellent"

    "review":"This is my local Chinese restaurant and its nae half bad The restaurant doesnt look like much from the outside or inside the interior is pretty naff and looks dated  I would definitely rather eat their grub in the comfort of my own living room I get the feeling that people dont come here for the dcor though its the food that has this place full on a Friday or Saturday night My sister will tell you that its the best Chinese in Edinburgh: I dont rate it quite so highly I always go for the shredded chilli beef and this is a dish that they have down to a tee: succulent pieces of beef fried until its nice and crispy then coated in a fiery chilli sauce mmm mmm mmm The prices are a little higher than average for a takeaway and they havent realised that some people would prefer them to not use MSG but all in all the food is quite good as far as local neighbourhood Chineses goGoing to a Chinese restaurant is a tricky prospect for me After eating so much Chinese food in Hong Kong and Singapore I have a lot more questions: is this Cantonese Do they serve shark fin Is it more American Chinese or Chinese Chinese Luckily we had a friendly patron waiting out front of Loon Fung ready to answer all these questions and profess that it was the best Chinese he had eaten in the city That was good enough for meWhen we sat down my sister and brotherinlaw and I compared our must haves: i need extra vegetables they needed the aromatic crispy duck with pancakes Peking duck and hot and sour soup we agreed on fried rice and bean curd and black bean sauce It was all so good The duck especially was a much larger serving than I am used to and we could make our own pancakes The fried rice tasted just like homeAs dinner wore on and we worked our way through the large amount of food the dining room slowly filled up When we had arrived there was only one other table but when we left it was full Before leaving however we ordered the toffee banana and lemon sorbet served in a frozen hollowed out lemon I would give the banana a miss but the lemon was coolAll in all it was a pleasant reminder of what Chinese food is outside of ChinaThis was pretty good Cantonese food for BritishScottish standards I suppose The dishes were on the small side but the quality of the food was good We had the seafood birds nest which on first glance I thought it only had seafood balls in it But eventually we uncovered some scallops and shrimps The birds nest was done nicely crispy but not too heavy dough We also had the sweet and sour pork which was fine lots of pineapple chunks which my toddler son always loves to eat The staff were friendly and helpful They seem to be from Hong Kong but have lived in the UK for quite a long time now So I think thats probably why the food is slightly westernized and not truly authentic Cantonese anymoreGood all round Chinese with all the usual favourites A tad pricey but defo the best Chinese in the Cannonmills areaThis is good pretty standard Cantonese fare with a particular focus on seafood Service is very prompt and the standard of the cooking is great Portions arent huge and the pricing therefore seems a little expensive for what you get but by and large if you want to eat at a good Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh Loon Fung definitely fits the billI have had 3 work team lunches at Loon Fung within just a few months of each other as it seems to be my teams favourite local restaurant  We always get the 3 course 8 lunch deal and I have now tried most things on the menu In fact they are having another lunch there next week and I have actually chosen not to go as Im definitely over it  I would rather try any of the other nice cafes nearby In saying that though the food is OK but nothing to write home about  Most dishes are as you would expect from reading the menu except the first time I went and ordered the lemon chicken  It was literally just a fillet of battered chicken in a sauce that I would call more sweet and sour rather than lemon  No veges or anything with it  The actual chicken was nice just not what I expected as all of the other main dishes were more like stirfry meals with a mix of meat and veges in a sauce and all mains come with riceHave always left feeling over full as the 3 courses is rather a lot of food  The guy with the glasses is a bit of a hard case often forgetting the orders and having to come back to check etc but is very friendly  The woman on the other hand seems rather sour"

    "review":"Pretty much everything youd expect from a Pizza Express  decent service a good Rose at a sensible price and very nice pizzas The air con was on rather ferociously on my visit but otherwise Ive no complaints and could well be making more use of this branch as its nice and handy for the officeModern setting for the chain pizza outlet Hard walls and virtually no soft furninshings meant lots of noise bouncing around the place so be prepared for some raised voicesLate evening visit seated at rear of the restaurant  you pass the service area at one side to pass through which to me is not ideal Busy tables but good service from staff who knew their stuff Usual menu pretty quick service as you might expect and a clean and efficient set up Very city centre location should mean it will be a busy place Get one of the online vouchers for one of their offers and this is a worthwhile easy meal RecommendedYes this is another branch of Pizza Express to grace Edinburgh But unlike the sigh I exhale from seeing another McDonalds or Starbucks open Pizza Express is a chain I rejoice in seeing spreadThere is no denying that the pizzas they make are top notch and with a few peronis and some good company you cant do much better in terms of pizza and beerI emphasise the pizza and beer though as this is the focal point of dining hereThis particular branch is new and snazzy and has a convenient location just off the royal mileMy boyfriend and I love to take advantage of Orange Wednesdays especially when budgeting so we decided to try out this new branch of Pizza Express A piece of advice: if you ever go to any Pizza Express on a Wednesday be sure to go before or after prime eating time between 79pm as it seems to get crazy full with young teens and other movie goers Anyway we came here at about 630 and it was pretty empty The service was fine although the girl got really confused about the 241 dinner deal Orange has she had to go and ask her supervisor The food was good as usual and the window seats are ideal for people watching Its quite a large place so great if you have a larger crowd of people They took a while to bring our bill think it was a technical glitch Other than this our food was delicious and I quite liked the funky layout of the place As far as chains goes  I quite enjoyed this one and would come back againPizza Express tends to be the same wherever you go but this one stands out thanks to its peoplewatching facilities As is usually the case with every member of this chain the front of the restaurant is entirely glass And this combined with the fact that its dual aspect and therefore looks out over both Victoria Street as well as George IV Bridge makes the ideal spot for some lunchtime spyng whilst eatingI have a lovehate relationship with Pizza Express If youre paying full price I think its a complete ripoff 10 for a pizza uncomfy wooden chairs and completely devoid of any of the character you usually associate with Italian eateries no thanks If however you take advantage of their seemingly endless special offers and deals then its another thing entirely The offers they send out by email are particularly good I got one sent to me the other day offering 2 courses and a 175ml glass of wine for 10 a head and theres no denying that thats good value for moneyThe cheap deals do have their downsides though Ive never felt so geriatric as during my last visit here when I looked around the restaurant and realised to my horror that almost every other table was occupied by awkwardlooking fifteen year olds on first dates hiding behind their menus whilst desperately trying to think of something to talk aboutBut for the moment at least Im leaning towards the love side of our lovehate relationshipI simply love Pizza Express theres not one thing on the menu which I wouldnt like My favorite at the moment is Da Morire which means to die for They also do great salads and pasta The only thing missing is steak I think I am signed up with my email address and they always send me vouchers without them the place might be a bit pricey Its a great place to take kids for lunch they have piccolo menu for about 7 pounds dough balls small salad pizza or pasta dessert and a little frothy milk kids just love itAlways feel very welcome there Recommended"

    "review":"This weekend Alan S and I had the wonderful good fortune of stumbling upon Ushers of Edinburgh The latest gastronomic craft beer pub to bless this fine city And what welcome surprise it was tooWed popped in on the Saturday night for a quick pint ahead of a friends birthday celebrations which was being held at the Pear Tree and we were both taken by the vibe of the place Sadly no amount of hinting to the crowd could steer the birthday festivities back to Ushers that night so we were adamant that we would be returning very soonFeeling a little worse for wear on the Sunday we decided that a hearty breakfast was needed and so we returnedThe menu offers some great options but we opted for the allday breakfast I had the veggie and Al had the full Scottish and neither of us needed to eat for the rest of the day For 8 and 9 respectively we certainly were very well catered for Each of the options come with coffee or orange juice included but we went for hair of the dog Served in a griddle pan the food was pretty much spilling off the sides I had a generously sized slice of bread 2 hash browns BBQ baked beans 2 tattie scones button mushrooms grilled tomato 2 eggs 2 leek and potato sausages and 2 slices of veggie haggis I must add not all of this was consumedUshers has an impressive 20 taps stocking a huge array of beers As a cider fan I was glad that there was Black Rat on tap They stock an impressive selection of spirits though I didnt spy the new kid in town: Pickerings Gin If the guys in charge of buying are reading this would be an amazing addition to your lineup The place itself is welcoming and friendly and the staff are knowledgeable and attentive Price point wise its comparable to other pubs such as Potting Shed and Hanging Bat but in my opinion this place is far nicer Id definitely recommend heading along before the festival folk discover this gemTheir fusion ipa is pretty good made in house and they have a decent selection no lagers when I went though Atmosphere was really cool and warm and bartenders were friendly and helpful Good place to watch rugby tooI enjoy this place a lot I never like to settle on a larger or an ale when I go to a bar usually this is because I never know what could be the next delicious thing and this bar definitely helps me explore They have a wide selection of craft beer and a friendly knowledgable bunch of staff You can discount as a student or a staff member as well which is always a good thing for meThe atmosphere is laidback and warm and there are board games so I am always sold on that Ive spent a couple of good evenings with friends there now The food and snacks are nice even if a tad pricey for the portions the reason I havent given this place 5 stars so I wouldnt recommend going if you want more than one or two pints and a bowl of chips to share but definitely a nice bar with a good vibeDropped by for an impromptu beer tasting Excellent selection of beer including proprietary Scotch brewsThe fish and chips and bunny chow were excellent tooFinding somewhere a with free seats b indoors and c reasonably priced for food on a Saturday night during the Fringe is no mean feat And the longer you ramble around George Square the hungrier you get Thank goodness then that we found Ushers of Edinburgh Having popped up unbeknown to me over summer right next to the Pear Tree and the Blind Poet this wee barcomerestaurant is pretty cool The menu is quite eclectic ranging from smaller bar food snacks to more substantial meals I settled for a salted beef and cream cheese bagel whilst my companion ordered the smoked salmon with soda bread The burgers that were going past our table did look mighty fine so I could easily be tempted back to try moreThe portion sizes were perfect for our dampened appetites shouldnt have opted for the preshow sandwiches  My bagel was really tasty if a little heavy on the cream cheese for my liking Im not a massive fan of smoked salmon so cant personally testify for that but apparently it was pretty good tooThe atmosphere was buzzing too with a standup performance going on through the back Later there was live music but the place noticeably quietened down at around half 10 Also the waiting staff were really friendly which is always nice Was certainly a better choice than waiting around in the soggy cold for a halfdecent bit of pizza in Assembly George Square GardensThis was an unexpected surpriseFeeling a hankerin for a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale I hit the tried and trusted grapevine or should that be hop vine of Twitter and asked Edinburgh folk if there was anywhere near me that sold it in Edinburgh where I was Fringin it up big timeI was given the lead that Ushers might so thanks to the trusty Yelp app plugplugplug off I trotted Its a wee bit far from my usual haunts but thats by no means a bad thing  I noticed a few places Id like to investigate at another point on my way hereUshers is downstairs in a basement kinda set up Despite that its bright and friendly and very welcoming The night I popped in there was some stand up comedy on on part of the building so there is entertainment offered as wellThe main point of coming here was the beer And here dear alcohol seekers is where Ushers excels They had Sierra Nevada not the Pale Ale but the much harder to find Torpedo IPA ScoreBefore that though I had a look at the choice of ales on the blackboard above the bar as I was looking one of the staff noticed and asked if I wanted to try any of the ales  having not tried the Outaspace Apple Ale from Drygate yet I opted for a taster of that Having tasted it I ordered a pintBeing a bit short on actual cash cash machine queues during the Fringe are hellish I asked if I could pay by card as I was going to get a Torpedo IPA as well  later Your man behind the bar set up a tab so I could get my second drink later and still have it cold and fresh from the fridge  excellent idea and brilliant serviceThe beers I had were cold fresh and served in fitting glasses for the surroundings and the TVs had sports news showing on them heaven for meAll in all a place i would heartily recommend for the ale lovers amongst us  a choice of 10 draft ales well stocked fridges and knowledgeable staff add up to happy times Cheers"

    "review":"This was somewhere Id wanted to pay a visit to for a long time but had for one reason or another so far failed to Im extremely glad I have finally done so as it was a very rewarding dining experience As seems to be the case anywhere with me at the moment my party were the only diners for a large part of the night but I never once got the impression that our greeting from Rafael himself or the attentiveness of our waitress would not have been just as warm and friendly had the restaurant been full We were guided through the menu by the man himself and his pride in the dishes on offer was infectious I opted for the lambs kidneys to start and they were fantastically well cooked My vegetable tart main course was also very good although I was rather jealous of the stuffed chicken dish with looked delicious All main courses were served with separate servings of perfectly cooked carrot broccoli and saffron infused potatoes and cauliflower The house red was very drinkable and well priced at 1490 Main list wines range from around 21 up to about 40 This is a gem of a restaurant and should be on everyones visit list Made my second visit here last Friday night and everything was as good as the last time Started with a great souffle main was very well cooked venison and nicely done veg The dessert escapes me but no complaints on that score eitherHad dinner in this beautiful intimate restaurant  The service was good not spectacular but good  The food was simply fantastic and the host the chef was wonderful  GREAT restaurantWhat a great wee place The chefowner Rafael makes you feel incredibly welcome and the food is really impressive Their potato asparagus and dill soup was just lovely I immediately asked Rafael for the recipe and have already taken the opportunity to recreate it at home The lamb shank main was lovely too I even got lured in to trying a very chocolatey dessert which is rare for me Hearty flavourpacked cooking at its best Rafaels is worth a visit soonOverall we said: Rafaels was seriously good Rarely have a spent a more enjoyable evening as a solo diner The quality of the food on offer was first rate with excellent ingredients prepared with considerable care and attention"

    "review":"Wow Absolutely loved this place and I still dream about it a month laterA buddy and I were were traveling through the UK and were in Edinburgh for a couple days Another review site that is not as detailed or as awesome as yelp had this place listed as the best restaurant in town Now I do not know if that is true or not or just an anomoly of their weird rating system but what I do know is that this was BY FAR the best restaurant we went to on our 3 dinner 4 lunch stay in town  Also ate at Kyloe and Witcheryin hindsight we should have just ate at Locanda de Gusti all 3 nightsonly slightly kiddingSo we walk init was like being transported to another place It was cold and kind of dreary outside and we walked into a warm coastal restaurant in Italy  It was amazing  The place was on the small intimate side  The woman serverowner instantly gave us a little Italian sass and it brought a smile to our faces as thats how friends and family I know treat each other  Our waiterowner a little older guy not that old but a little older than a normal 20 yr old server was very warm and friendly  So the crowd makeup was awesome A couple tables of people on dates and several tables of girls on what appeared to be girls night out  I wish we had been closer to one of the several tables with groups of girls AnywayWe skipped the normal app and opted for a pizza Margherita as an appetizer I mean the pizza is from the Naples area afterall so when in Rome err NaplesSo my buddy is from an intalian family near Chicago As we were eating the piza he said it was probably the best pizza hes had since being at his grandmas house which is drumroll please near Naples  And this dude really isnt a food person and he loved the pizza  So did I just backing up my opinion  Oh and the bread was wonderfula little chew yummMany italian restaurants Ive been to will have you get a pasta as a second course with yet a main course later I asked the beautiful woman server part owner and she didnt recommend it but said order one and if your still hungry to order the other  Glad she was honest and didnt upsell as I got the fresh made pasta with rabbit ragu forget the actual name  Not only was it plenty it was absolutely delicious  I asked them to pair a wine for me as I dont know my Italian wines very well what can I say Im from California They brought me a medium bodied slightly dry red wine that paired wonderfully and wasnt too expensive  My buddy had a lobster with pasta that was on special I believe He rather enjoyed itFinished off with a panna cotta It was ok It was nothing special but it wasnt bad  Oh and how could I forgetat the end of the meal they brought us a nice shot of limoncello  Wasnt the best Ive ever had but the gesture was awesome and it was a perfect finish to a great meal  We made or Thursday night reservation just a few days in advance but the restaurant was full the entire time so I would definitely suggest making a reservationI come from a big Italian family and because of this Ive always been a bit sceptical of new Italian restaurants popping up in Edinburgh My parents especially my mum have their favourites and we normally just go to our locals This little southern Italian restaurant just off haymarket is pretty perfect The setting is small and intimate just as any good restaurant should be The staff are all really friendly and welcoming My friends and I all had an opportunity to practice out Italian and I didnt make a utter tit if myself The interior reminds me of being in Tuscany and stumbling across a hidden little gem of a pizzeria or trattoria in the middle of nowhere The walls are lined with cook books holy water great selections of wine and balsamic vinegars They use old cans of chopped tomatoes for candles and cutely on the table Nothing really matches but it just kind of makes the place even better As for the food the menu is very Neapolitan Its dont a big menu but everything looked really tasty I ordered sea food for starter and a olive oil and broccoli pasta dish for my main Along with a bottle of read wine naturally And to top of the evening we all shared some limoncello Perfect night out XMy fiance and I were in Edinburgh for 36 hours and eager to find some great neighborhood spots when we werent seeing the sights Locanda de Gusti was exactly what we were looking for An amazing local gem We read the reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor but boy did they undersell This quiet spot is a must for the unaware residents of Edinburgh or for tourists looking for a delicious meal outside of the tourist zones I started off with the Panzarotti  a delicious serving of two potato croquettes For entrees I throughly enjoyed the Guanciale with handmade roughcut pasta Mmmmm My fiancee ate the orecchiette and raved about it the entire way home The local flavor of Naples definitely shone through all the way to this great spot in Edinburgh The waitstaff local personas from Italy definitely helped provide an ambiance that felt as though we had been transported back to Italy If you are in Edinburgh I HIGHLY recommend you go here Its worth the adventureWe did some research and couldnt find one bad review for Locanda de Gusti so I quickly booked a table for dinner And Im following the trendthis place is one of the best Italian restaurants Ive ever been to and even beats a couple that Ive visited in ItalyOn arrival we were directed to our really sweet table by the window immediately Its not a large restaurant but a cute intimate setting that honestly feels like you are visiting an Italian family and Mamma is busy preparing dinner Even before I had glanced at the menu I had a feeling this was going to be good The menu changes daily not every item but fish dishes etc and it was so hard to choose which dish to have All of their pasta dishes can also be made gluten free is required We decided not to order starters  and for my main I ordered pasta with cherry tomatoes mozzarella and basil 1295 It was DELICIOUS Im not one for ordering what I class as plain dishes but Im so glad I did You could tell immediately that the pasta was freshly made and I dont have a single complaint My friend ordered a pizza and it looked so tasty For dessert I had the dark chocolate mousse 495 and it was intense rich and oh so yummy I love dark chocolate and I was in heaven We ordered a bottle of prosecco 2195 which went down a treat They did have an extensive wine list What makes Locanda de Gusti is the staff though They were attentive without being over attentive and could not have been nicer They were teaching guests Italian phrases Im sure one of the waiters is Italian himself and I just loved it Ill definitely be back and would recommend Locanda de Gusti to EVERYONE The staff definitely made it a memorable experience and as for the food Well Im still dreaming about my dessertI visited Locanda de Gusti yesterday evening for the first time and was excited to see what all the fuss was about Its regarded on trip adviser as Edinburghs no 1 restaurant and difficult to get a reservation We were warmly welcomed into what felt like a cosy atmospheric Italian family kitchen Friendly and knowledgeable waiting staff were able to give recommendations on food wine and specials and had good banter with us also Everything here is homemade authentic and delicious We both had pasta starters one with Scottish beef and pork in a rich lip smackingly good tomato sauce one of the best Ive ever tasted The other fresh pasta was with fresh clams mussels and a hint of chilli also full of flavour and cooked perfectly The main courses of mixed fish platter again perfectly cooked but simple and their aubergine shoes looked and tasted brilliant Tiramisu for desert and a complimentary amaretto topped off a lovely meal and both were quirkily presented For me there was just a tiny something missing but I will definitely be visiting again to try more of their authentic menuVisited Locanda de Gusti on a Saturday night with a group of friends I had previously been at their old premises near Broughton Street so was looking forward to a return visit For starter I had the burrata: mozzarella with a soft center served with parma ham and dates The combination of the three was lovely the sweet dates went well with the salty parma ham Main course was duck with marsala sauce and grapes It was served with potatoes and vegetables Sadly the duck was a bit over cooked but it still tasted good I shared a dessert of chocolate mousse It came in a cute little jar Again nothing wrong with the taste but the consistency of the mousse wasnt what I expected  it should have been airy and light but was more like a chocolate ganache When we were paying the bill the waiter brought 2 mini bottles of amaretto to the table for a complimentary shot which I thought was a nice touchLocanda de Gusti is a nice little restaurant with a homely decor and obviously good cooking The atmosphere on a Saturday evening was good I appreciate the fact that the menu isnt the usual pizza  pasta options you have in your standard italian restaurants in Edinbugh"

    "review":"Irish Pubs are not my thing at all  so it seems odd then that this particular one was easily one of the best nights out I have ever hadHaving decided to show up simply for a quick drink before heading to the cinema myself and three friend ended up staying all night and completly missing the filmThe staff are funny and fresh  drinks are cheapish and the decor is modern and yet still distinctly Irish Pubesque However these are not the reasons we ended up staying for as long as we did  the atmoshpere is fun and energetic one of the most relaxing and comfortable places I have been to in a long timeNeedless to say I will be back to Malones  hopefully before the next St Patricks dayMalones is a brilliant new Irish themed pub with booze and banter in plentiful supply From the street it looks relatively small but looks can be deceiving Once youre in and past the bar the place is massive there are booths to sit in and high tables with stools if you look up the ceiling must be at least 50ft high They have live music every night and its surprisingly good  so good in fact that my friends and I thought it was a CD playing until we clocked the band on the stage The staff are all friendly and welcoming and will happily ply you with shots tequilasambuca and Tabasco  definitely not one for the fainthearted As those with some Irish in them might say its great craicFrom the outside Malones looks like yet another typical Irish themed bar in Edinburgh However once inside Malones has plenty of surprises in store The bar which at first seems to offer nothing apart from Guinness and Guinness Extra Cold offers a range of drinks and delicious themed shots On top of this Malones sells crisps from Ireland crisps which are a cut above your normal Walkers From the bar you are struck by the size of the place Upstairs Malones offers several booths while on the ground floor you wont be stuck for any seating The place has been indulged with Irish themed decor which in a large bar makes it seem quite warm and cosy This bar has had many different faces in recent years however the thing that makes Malones stand out from Odd fellows or Fat Cow is that it has a energetic atmosphere which is created by the fantastic music on offer Every night bands play live with traditional folk music too quick paced Irish songs on offer Malones goes beyond the typical Irish themed pub with its energetic atmosphere and music and adds to the already legendary pubs on Forrest roadMalones is an Irish bar and unlike many pretenders to this title it follows through  The main drink here is Guinness and compared to other drinks it is reasonably priced both because Guinness is slightly cheaper here and also because other pints are slightly more expensive  theres only one pint they really want you to drink and its with a sigh theyll pour anything else  That said they do offer a good range of shots and the barmen do know their spiritsIf youre lucky enough there might be live music on and if this is the case youre in for a treat  Ive never seen a bad band here and more often than not theyve got strong Irish roots  For the experience it offers this has to be one of the best Irish pubs in EdinburghThis place has changed hands and names 3 times in the last three years so when Malones took over from The Fat Cow I really didnt see it lasting that long But I was wrongThe inside looks like the standard Irish pub with lots of dark wood and green and beige dcor but theyve quirked it up a bit by painting famous quotes about all things Irish all over the walls which kept me entertained when my friend had nipped off to the loo We perched in one of the high booths in the window which offered a prime peoplewatching vantage point but they have a whole load of sofas and tables throughout the huge downstairs area to choose fromDrinks are roughly 34 which is more exensive than a lot o other bars in the area but the service was fast and the beer was cold so I didnt mind We were only there for a few quiet afternoon drinks but Ive heard that it gets really lively in the evenings and from what I saw advertised they have regular ceilidh nights and live music evenings which I will be sampling soonMalones is a great Irish pub which offers friendly staff and comfortable environment for you to relax in  The drinks are reasonably priced with most pints costing less than 3 and so its an ideal place to go for either a quiet drink with friends or a good session before hitting the pubs  The decor is interesting with lots of maps pictures and Irish memorabilia to look at whilst you enjoy your drinks  The staff are lively and are perfectly fine with you getting slightly rowdy before heading out  Whether youre just chilling out with some friends or properly going for it Malones is the place to come"

    "review":"The food here is the same decent quality stuff that you expect from the chain By now you probably know whether you like their food and drink or not Whatever decision you reached this branch is not going to change your mindA couple of things to note though As the pictures posted by other reviewers show this particular restaurant sits on a river called the Water of Leith If weather permits pizza by the water would probably be lovely If not the window seats will still give you  nice view out onto the waterIts more cramped in here than in most pizza express restaurants Its a great place to eavesdrop if thats what youre after but I bringing children in here would be stressfulAlthough the place is quite nice the service was just awful When we had our drinks they gave us a very dirty glass Who couldnt they notice We waited for almost 30 minutes to have our food and to be honest its too expensive for what you have Im definitely not trying againFirst time here and Im really happy with the service will most definitely be backCame here to try out my new tastecard allowing a 2 for 1 meal with my partner Our server was friendly attentive and treated us like old friendsWe ordered the dough balls and bruschetta to start both came out within a reasonable time and were hot and fresh Mains were the american hot pizza and chicken ceaser salad This was certainly the best ceaser salad Ive had in quite some time Desserts cheesecake and the chocolate glory Probably more chocolate than one person needs but it was delicious The cheesecake was even better With a few drinks and use of the tastecard 20 came off the bill A great meal given the price and Im so impressed with the service we received from the staffNormally when I go for pizza I dont usually go to Pizza Express however on a Wednesday mainly due to Orange Wednesday offers I do like to pay it a visit However I just dont go to any Pizza Express Oh no I go to the one in Stockbridge The reason is not just due to the good service but due to its building and setting Spread over two floors there are plenty of seats indoors however on a hot Summers day there is also a terrace where one can eat pizza and drink a nice glass of white wine And this seating area has views over the river of Leith Doesnt sound very glamours but at times it can be quite nice One of the better places to go for a bite to eat in the area you will be eating in not your average Pizza Express but Stockbridges pizza ExpressNormally I dont really bother reviewing chain places Theyre all largely the same and weve probably all been to oneIm making an exception for this place for the following reason:The staff here are super lovely The majority of customers here were families with youngish kids and the staff were all super playful and kind and lovely Its not much recognition but these guys are topTheres a waiter here who sings Happy Birthday in a hugely theatrical and very loud operatic style I commend him for his vocal abilities but this cant be up everyones alley and if youre hoping for a quiet relaxed meal then this might not be the place as it does seem to attract larger louder partiesFoodwise I cant complain Pizza here was pleasant and filling and we were all satisfied I love love love polenta fries and the serving here was delicious Afterwards I went for the festive mulled sloe gin which was lovely and had a nice kick to it Im a big sloe gin fan and it was nice to see a nod to the traditional mulled wine option whilst offering something new Mmm mmm mmm I may just have to conjure my own at home before the festive season is throughService was fine too But other than that Id say theres far more interesting places to go for dinner Id go back to this Pizza Express for sure but only once I was all out of other options  Its certainly not a bad spot for dinner"

    "review":"A solid place for a casual bite with a twinge of hipness Several cuts of steak bunch of different toppings for burgers fries baked potatoes and a few beers and wines No complaints here But its nothing to go on aboutWe had a cauliflower soup and an all day breakfast The breakfast was good the best part was the sausage and the haggis is just alright But the cauliflower soup was delicious Just like everywhere else in Edinburgh some waiters  waitresses tend to be slightly abrasive at first but then theyre nicer A little smile goes a long wayCracking wee venue a couple of beers on tap and good honest pub food We had a table of 20 adults and kids and they gave us the backroom so we could sprawl out and make as much noise as we wanted RecommendedOur waitress was quite rude I asked for some butter and syrup for my waffle and she said thats weird which made me kind of upset The food was okI ordered waffles and they came out cold The Bloody Mary wasnt good order something else The sausage egg and cheese bap was good thoughI can only agreewith a previous reviewer Stay away from the ribs i gave them a chance because how bad can they be when you are european well i will not have them again but the steaks and burgers are still worth a visit and i keep going backFull disclosure I am from the Southern part of the United States Fortunately I have been to plenty of restaurants named Smoke Stack in my life The expectation I have is that the food would have some beautiful smokey flavour Unfortunately this place does not meet that expectation  The location and atmosphere are great which is the only thing saving this place from a 1 star The price is high for what youre getting I got the ribs which had never come close to a grill or smoker They seems to have been boiled in too much sauce and reminded me of the McRib My wife got the prawn and avocado salad Prawns were completely unseasoned and the avocado was a wee bit past its prime The highlight was the elderflower martini One last thing I would like to addFOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE THE BLOODY MARY OFF THE MENU That was a joke in poor taste to the wonderful drink that has saved me from many a hangovers I believe it has cranberry juice in it Disgusting"

    "review":"Cosy particularly last night now that the autumnal temperatures seem to be here and friendly bar that to my mind only lacked a couple of decent ales in order to boost its profile Having now eaten here July 2010 Im more than happy to award it another star having experienced speedy and friendly service as well as very much enjoying my hake with saladWholesome hearty  food with a homely feel  Think of the Compass offerings as your mums feel good grub with a professional guiseWalking past the window of the Compass I caught a glimpse of the chef slicing a big crusty bread loaf on a rustic wooden slab slices of what looked like Brie and a bunch of fresh herbs nestled at the side   That image convinced me to dine there with little consideration and I was not let downInside youll find a typical up market pub interior: stone walls wooden tables and slouch worthy chairs What sets this place apart is food I tried a braised duck leg with a spicy potato stew  top quality stuff and under ten pounds tooThis is a nice laidback local establishment in Leith which is good for some decent food and a few bevs The red decor and brick wall beside the bar make this an attractive wee place which feels pretty spacious and beams in lots of light Theres the traditional wooden chairs and tables thing going on no sofas about which makes it slightly more of a restaurant where you have to sit up straight at the table rather than a pub and restaurant where you can lean back a bit more in comfier seating and chill with both food and drinksIt always seems to be busy here and it is definitely really popular with the locals The menu is really reasonably priced too so this is a worthwhile stop if youre drinking or eating in the Leith areaThe starters drinks and prices and ambience are all OK but the main courses served up to us were unacceptable The fishcakes and smoked salmon starters were actually quite nice The main course was an unmitigated disaster and theres no point in talking to people who get their food this badly wrong Im a good cook and discerning foodie myself so perhapsa tad fussy though I never give reviews this bad to anyone  nobody should have to eat this stuff  I had a risotto which consisted off overcooked pudding rice cooked in plain water with a few other ingredients chucked in at the end as an afterthought and the combination was not a good one even if the risotto had been correctly preparedRisotto is properly cooked from raw arborio rice with a hot half half stock and wine mix added throughout cooking until the risotto reaches a creamy texture parmesan cheese is added towards the end You have to stand over the pan for 30 minutes Busy experienced chefs can manage this juggling with other dishes but no such luck here Taking shortcuts with this process is very dodgy territory at the best of times but serving up the watery mush that is delivered here is completely beyond the pale The home made burger was also 100 unacceptable  of a very dry grainy completely grey texture Deep frozen then rapidly microwawed on full power to destruction Massive amounts of ketchup and mayo needed to make it edible The clientelle all looked mature in years so maybe overcooking the rice suits them Ive been in Scotland a year and this is the worst rubbish served up at any establishmentExcellent smoked fish pie soup Generous portion Ample variety of beer and ale Reasonable prices Neighborhood atmosphere Lovely staffCompass used to be my local for years  So much so I used to eat there more or less once a week  I couldnt rave about this place enough up until about 6 months ago when I think the quality went down a notch or two  This lovely little bar in the heart of Leith has a great atmosphere and usually you can just walk in and get a table though thats not to say it is really quiet  I always thought that the food menu was great value main meals ranging between 713 for great quality local produce such as seabass venison steak etc  However lately we have been in less frequently as we have noticed that the usually extensive menu has turned more pub grub like with everything battered and accompnied with chips  I wouldnt rule it out though as it is a good place  Definitely worth a try"

    "review":"A well placed Pool Table greets you when you enter here via the side door If Id known it had that Id have been in ages ago Compared to a lot of pub tables in Edinburgh this one has practically no bad spots from which to take your shots A well priced bar and decently maintained interior round out a good drinking experience especially if you want to unobtrusively see some local culture and maybe get some banter or at least a chat about the football 2013  Now under new management  renamed The Other Place the pool table has gone the range of beers has increased the bars moved to the east wall and food is being served Bar prices are the same as more central establishments now but the general atmosphere is pretty relaxed and mature Having not sampled anything off the food menu Ive docked a star for nowHad a lovely meal with my little one  Kiddos are allowed until 8pm  Lots of vegetarian options available  The falafel burger was excellent  They have a lot of smaller plates available too so would be a nice place to go with a few friends for apps and drinksThis pub is perfect We really enjoyed to eat and drink here The food is delicious and the ambience niceWalked by this place several times and seems really nice but when we tried to visit for dinner at 6:30 with our family they said the dont normally serve children and it was implied we should leave so we didWent back here beginning December as a place to meet up with farwide pals as we had enjoyed good service last time We waited awhile for a table to sit at because of christmas lunch bookings that would not leave But the staff kept us notified and took our orders and were able to seat us before the food came which was brilliant The fried chicken Caesar salad and everything else got big thumbs up and we constantly monitored for drink refills and did not at all feel like the staff were tired of christmas Cant believe they pump a that food out of that wee tiny kitchenAll things considered with how incredibly disappointing new places have proven recently we are glad to have found somewhere nearby that seems honest not trying too hard to be something hipstercoolandfailing and just simply providing really good food at great prices with most importantly easy comfortable and GOOD solid customer service Thank goodness for The Other PlaceMy friend and I sampled one of the many many beers they have on offer A Weiss wheat beer Delicious We also had fantastic belly pork ribs a shrimp salad and their divine chilli fries Our waitress was lovely  I was given an I love ribs bib to wear :All in all great food and ambience especially if you can sit by the window on a sunny day"

    "review":"Very relaxed dog friendly caf in Leith Great breakfast place try their scrambled eggs and a nice quiet place to read a book or get some work doneWe have been coming here since it first opened and have no complaints The service is excellent and staff are friendly Choice on menu is great and food is fresh Price for their coffee is reasonable and on par with other places locally  The atmosphere is relaxed Recent addition is a cassette wall where punters can choose their own music for hundreds of cassettes from the 70s 80s early 90s  Love it  Our dog is very welcome and always gets fresh water which he spills over never to any complaint from staff My only complaint is that I wished it opened later into the evening ie 9pm as its hard to get a cafe in leith open past 5pm to serve coffee and food Maybe this is something they could consider for the summer months Id vote it the best cafe in leith Cute cafe in Leith  This cafe has some character with the old stereos on display and plenty of seating  I ordered a chai latte and my hubby an Americano  I got the avocado egg on toast and he got a much yummier chicken avocado wrap  Id have rated higher had my bacon not been missed and the design on my second latte been a dollop of a mess  They also assumed Id like a regular size  which was too small and why I got a another in large  Great little place with good service   It appears to be busy on a weekend but is a quaint spot to meet up with friends or do a bit of workI am not quite of the you cant have too many cafes school of thinking but not far away so I was pleased to see Constitution Street get another coffee focused cafe Located on the corner opposite the Compass pub The Hideout Cafe starts with the great benefit of replacing an eyesore empty site  Its a bright space with a mix of furniture styles including a bench made of old pallets One of its great virtues is the friendly staff with smiles and going that extra mile no issue This good start is assisted greatly by decently prepared Artisan Roast coffee Good selection of cakes and pastries  The breakfast rolls and sandwiches are good too Costwise the Hideout fits into the normal fancy coffee cafe bracket: around 220 for a regular sized espresso based drink This is becoming increasingly popular including with the mums and occasional dad from local Leith Primary Its obvious comparator business is Printworks 100m down the street For the moment the longer established Print works may just have the edge for me but its close and if Hideout continues to develop it could see itself become a popular quality cafeMy good Yelp friend Caz H met me here for lunch as neither of us had tried it  Its quirky and so cool with all the audio tapes stack until the ceiling  It even has an old ghetto blaster  man the 80s rockThe food rocks too  I had a veggie wrap warmed which was well packed and felt healthy and tasted yummy at the same time  Ginger beer was my drink of choice because it was too darn hot outside for coffee and I needed a thirst quencherIt took a wee while for our wraps to come out They didnt look too busy and I dont think it was too complicated an order to process and make upThe cakes are well impressive  I need to come back for coffee and cake  They are made in house and look very appealing to gobble up the cake of course  I was tempted to take a piece away but resisted quite well so I will obviously have to come back and try the cake now  ha haLovely wee addition to this part of town Bright airy and spacious with plenty of light coming in the huge windows perfect for people watchingA big array of savoury wraps rolls and sandwiches as well as sweet treats I had a tasty toasted scone and an americano  made with a very delicious and well pulled shot of Artisan roast coffeeIf i lived in the area I would definitely hunker down here more often and do productive things Only issue for me is the distance from my house :"

    "review":"First time at Frankie  Bennys but disappointed with the food Typical American fare with lots of fried food and meat But neither were tasty Our sharing platter had a range of nibbles but all were a bit lacklustre tasting like the frozen stuff you get from IcelandI had the FB special of ribs and chicken but the ribs lacked flavour and the chicken was extremely tough Fries were ok thoughService was also a bit slow which was surprising considering it was a Wednesday evening it was pouring outside and the place was less than half fullThe London Insiderhttp:wwwlondoninsidercoukPretty awful if Im honest The food was just about passable but really expensive I ordered a side of a jacket potato and some corn on the cob The potato was really dry and wasnt fresh and the corn arrived without any seasoning or butter Blandsville The other half went for a chicken wrap thing  it was almost 12 and a seriously dismal looking plate of food What a rip off Wont be returningAvoid at weekends at all cost It is pricey especially when you realise you can it there for half the price during the week it is busy the service was cold and the food on the greasy side It gets more than a star as it caters well for kids and comes with an entrainment pack though saying that today my little one got it at the end of his meal The waitress looked busy which is fair enough though she only cracked a smile when I heard her saying her shift was ending at 4pm as I witnessed she was not under any botox impediment I would have expected a little bit more enthusiasm from her Food was served quickly despite being rush hour so that also was a good point for FB We ordered black and blue burgers and a mac and cheese burger it came with coleslaw and a bit of lettuce and salad Personally needed more greens All in all it is an OK place to go if you want a bite to eat with your family If you choose to go aim to go there during the week so you dont feel cheated but dont expect an healthy optionthe gyle industrial estate is pretty much lacking in anywhere decent to go when you want to have lunch outside the office  so when Frankie  Bennys opened up at the shopping centre about a year ago i was pretty pleased that there was another option  i had a visit recently with Joe A and Kelly F for a quick lunchwhat this place does well is having a good lunch offer with two courses for a tenner or three for 12  there is also a specials menu which is slightly more expensive with a few different options  both menus have a fairly good selection and we were happy to order off the lunch one  i got potato skins with cheese and bacon to start followed by a goats cheese and bruchetta wrap with frieswhat this place doesnt do so well is timliness of orders  since the majority of people that come for lunch here work nearby you would expect the lunch orders to be quick but we did wait a bit for both starters and mains which meant we had to rush back to the officer afterwards with no time for dessert if wed wanted it  however my food was good and i enjoyed the wrap a lot  goats cheese makes everything good  also for the price it was pretty good value  the service was good besides the slight slowness in placing an order and getting food  our waitress was friendly and the restaurant itself is quite large so easy to get a seat every during the busy time  id happily come back for another lunch out of the office but maybe leave a bit extra time during my next visit"

    "review":"Well priced with a varied and interesting wine list and pleasant waiting staff this is another establishment that would have benefited from a further half star if that was possible My starter of crayfish tails and the main courses of mushroom stroganoff and thai fishcakes with well cooked new potatoeswere all resounding successes washed down with a pleasant 1795 chardonnay The dessert was a bit of a misnomer however  when I order a brulee I expect to have to break into it not for it to be ready smashed This was an enjoyable meal in an establishment Ive previously only drunk in but I wouldnt suggest coming here for an intimate evening  the acoustics due I imagine to its cellar nature make it pretty noisy even when as was the case at the weekend it is no more than half fullMade a reservation here for New Years Eve before heading out to Hogmanay  While the bar seems like a cool place to grab  a pint or a glass of wine I wasnt blow away with the restaurant  The menu was fairly standard for Scotland pork belly steak pie fish and chips a few soups etc and it was OK  However I was expecting a bit more selection from the wine list and the waiter didnt have much knowledge of the wines at all  The service was polite and pleasant but not great  For the price this is a reasonable place however I would keep to lunch and the bar and skip it for dinnerGreat atmosphere wine oysters WiFi and friendly service Whighams is always a treatThis place is awesome When I made the reservation I requested a table near the stage for Sunday Jazz night When we got there the waitress sat us in front of the stage We could not have asked for a better table Our reservation was for 7:45 and the band was setting up when we got there They started playing at exactly 8pm What a night we had The evening was filled with wonderful live jazz and delicious food  drinks My husband and I started by sharing the seafood platter Holy cow We were visiting from Boston Massachusetts and we know our seafood Whighams seafood platter was amazing The most delicious sweet oysters and clams weve ever had The LangoustineOh my god I couldve had 20 more For entrees we both ordered prawn linguine Previous to ordering I mentioned to the waitress that I didnt like spicy food She told us that the sauce was premade and it would be a little spicy but she would give me a little ramekin of some sort of white cream sauce to mix my pasta with To be honest I was skeptical about this but it worked By mixing that cream sauce to my linguine it made it into a vodka cream sauce without the vodka and lessen the spiciness It was pretty darn good We had a couple of different servers and both were professional  attentive The Jazz band was superb The singer was this young woman and she had this voice that sounded like smooth vintage wine If youre planning on dining here and you love jazz make your reservation on the nights they have live jazz night You wont be disappointedThis is one of my favourite finds in the city And what a findHidden away in the depths of Charlotte Square this place doesnt look like much Its got such a lovely authentic atmosphere though really genuine and comfortingIts really traditional and a great place to come if you would like a relaxing authentic atmosphere  Yes its a bit cavelike but its an experienceWhen you go which you will you wont be disappointed and youll be back alongside ArnoldThis place was hopping I really enjoyed it but my husband was less impressed"

    "review":"I have only ever been to this Zizzi once and everything about it screams average my friend and I only went because of a two for one offer that Id come across When we arrived at the restaurant it took ages for us to get a seat because of the throngs of office workers taking up all the tables Although the restaurant was physically clean it seemed a bit grotty to me like the way that a McDonalds is grotty Our food was pretty standard I had a pizza which was freshly baked but could just as easily have been one of Tescos Finest and my friend had a seafood pasta which was somewhat lacking in seafood The service was alright but not particularly friendly or quick I dont think I shall be returningZizzi was revamped at the end of 2013 Now the decoration is fresh bright and comfortable The staff are well trained and friendly The food is good and very fresh They make the best tiramisu I have found in EdinburghI am on their mailing list so had a 30 discount voucher off all main courses  I met up with the girls for an early dinner after work and we had calzone and garlic breadThey dont have any veggie calzones on the menu but did do one on request  The mushroom calzone was actually very tasty and I loved the rosemary garlic bread with sea salt on top  Not bad price too with the voucherI ordered a sprite and asked for no ice and a straw they did a weird thing of pouring into a short tumbler but then adding a long straw that just kept falling out the glass as it didnt fit  I quickly ditched that  I liked the food and the new dcor but the tables were squished too close together and it took an age to get the billThe dcor and food are great the staff were wandering about a bit and not achieving muchwhen trying to book a table the last friday before christmas i was stuck  phoning a few places clearly showed that even at 6pm they were all booked solid for the evening and with a my fingers crossed and last bit of hope i phoned Zizzi to see if there was the chance of a free table  the man who answered the phone very happily assured me that there was and took my bookingnow i know edinburgh is all about the independent restaurants and bars but sometimes the reliability of a chain does come in handy  especially when youre wanting a relatively quick dinner at a decent price  when we arrived friday we were shown a table in the middle of the dining room but after seeing another couple more from a table near the window which appeared quieter we asked to be moved there  they happily accomdated us and we were soon sat contemplating menus  after a rather lengthy wait trying to get our waitress attention we eventually managed to order and food arrived shortlyi think its hard to do italian wrong and Zizzi definitely is a place that gets it right  i had a chicken and spinach calzone which was really quite good full of spinach and a bechamel sauce with a dried ham on top  it could have used a bit more chicken but overall it was quite good  the white wine we got with the meal was easy to drink and a good price  the only downfall was the wait to actually order food when it appeared our waitress had actually forgotten that we existed  however for a quick meal on one of the busiest friday nights of the year this was a good optionZizzi wasnt particularly bad and Ive no complaints Yet I dont think Ill be a regular The only reason I decided to come here for dinner was because I had a gift card We were there between lunch and dinner times for a late lunch and the restaurant was lacking in atmosphereThe calzone was HUGE definitely a case of quantity over quality as I was most blown away by the generous portion as opposed to the filling and flavours Service was friendly too Perfectly AOK nothing blowing me awayOther than that I dont have a whole lot to say other than that Edinburgh has far more interesting places to eat and some awesome little hidden gems worth seeking out  All things considered Zizzi is fairly unoriginalBland and generic sums it up reallyI ordered a skinny Pizza guaranteed to be under 500 calories and It was like chewing cardbboard  not that I have ever munched on cardboard but you know what I mean I should have gone for the full fatty pizza which I have to say are pretty tasty So if you do go to zizzs order a pizza as they are they best option on the menu The pasta dishes are created by the chef who then  thin decides what should go into it instead of what you orderexpecitng Value wise it isnt bad but I think youd be better going elsewhere for 813 per main course The decor is sligtly clinical with all the metalic tables and everytme I removed myself from the table I banged my head on a low light and I am only 55 ish  58 with hair bun so its not the best designed Its an ok establishment for meeting for a quick meal and catch up with friends but If I wanted to make it a special occasion then Id choose somewhere else"

    "review":"What can I say its a Starbucks You know what youre gettingThis branch is fairly new to the area and helping to go some way to redressing the balance of empty unitsbargain shops on Shandwick Place after the trams fiasco caused businesses along its route to shut due to the inability of customers to access themAnyway Its pretty big theres a lot of seating in the back and you dont need a code to get into the toilets which is always good Unfortunately its also fairly soulless it doesnt seem to fit with the recent Starbucks policy of individual interiors see the one on the corner of the Royal Mile and Hunter Square as an excellent example But you know theres coffee theres muffins and theres panini And free wifiIts StarbucksA fairly generic Starbucks though it only opened fairly recently so it does still have that shiny new feel to it The service was fast and the staff pretty friendly Really everything youd expect from StarbucksThe real reason for this review is to share the most entertaining spelling I have ever had of my name People frequently spell it wrong but Teves is a whole new level Im going to enjoy this for a while"

    "review":"Am letzten Tag meines SchottlandUrlaubs ist es doch noch passiertIch war gewarnt ich ahnte was mich erwarten wrde aber kurz vor dem Rckflug hatte ich keine Hemmungen mehr und es einfach getanIch habe Haggis gegessenIch habe ihn nicht nur gegessen ich habe ihn als Teil eines original schottischen Frhstcks zu mir genommen Haggis ist das schottische Nationalgericht das aus einem in einem Schafsmagen ber Stunden gekochten Gemisch aus durchgedrehten Schafsinnereien Schafsnierenfett Zwiebeln und Hafermehl besteht Der seifig penetrante Geschmack von Leber und Haferflocken wollte sich schon nach dem ersten Biss im gesamten Gaumen festsetzen hatte aber keine Chance Denn ich hatte ja noch black pudding auf meinem Teller Die gebratene Scheibe aus Blut Milch Rindertalg und ebenfalls Hafermehl hielt auf sehr robuste Art geschmacklich dagegenZu dem ebenfalls zugehrigen Wrstchen und dem Rhrei mchte ich nichts sagen aber wer solche Frhstcke erfindet muss vor Hunger schon halb wahnsinnig gewesen sein Dazu passt dass in Schottland beim Anschneiden des Haggis sogar Oden vorgetragen werden sollenIm The Rail Bridge ist solches nicht vorgekommen Die freundlichheimelige Atmosphre der Blick auf die berhmte Forth Road Bridge der flinke Service und der Genuss des zum Frhstck servierten Tees lieen die Welt langsam wieder in einem anderen Licht erscheinen eine liebenswerte Welt ohne Blut Leber und Haferschleim Warum sich die Schotten aber ber Jahrhunderte gegen feindliche bernahmen wehren mussten ist mir endgltig ein RtselQuite busy here when myself and friends popped in on the way back from this yearss Rock Ness festival but we managed to get a table at the window and so had the pleasant view across to Fife whilst we ordered and ate Noone had any complaints about the food Haggis Neeps  Tatties Cajun Salmon and the service was friendly and as quick as could be expected given the time of day and amount of other customers Id have no reservations about going back Made it back here last night for a quick pint and opted to share the cheese board which turned out to be let down by a lack of chutney to accompany it depite the fact that they sell jars of the stuff in the attached shop They were unable to serve filter coffee either Schoolboy error on someones part but service  the cheeses themselves were fineOn the main running into the old town of South Queensferry the Rail Bridge Bistro sits perfectly overlooking the Firth of Forth and the coastal towns of the Kingdom of Fife The Bistro is a great place to pop in and have your breakfast or lunch or even just for a quick bite to eat with a coffee For breakfast one can have a full Scottish cooked breakfast or even go continental with French toast Prices are quite reasonable with a cooked breakfast costing less than seven pounds The lunch menu is dominated by the bistros locality with seafood dishes offered throughout the menu The Bistro was quite busy when I paid it a visit and seemed very popular with tourists After youre fed and watered one can pay the wee gift shop a visit however a warning to all this shop is heavily stocked with your usual tacky tourist gifts Try the Bistro and least and try and pass by the gift shopI visited this bistro for the first time over the weekend As my first time in South Queensferry despite our arrival in the dark the town itself and subsequently this restaurant is quite lovely Featuring an absolutely fantastic view of the Forth Rail Bridge a tiny replica of the bridge with a moving wee train inside a nice toasty fireplace and some historic information hanging from the walls youve got a lot of lovely things to look at hereFor me though the food was just good Nothing too mindblowing or lifechanging and considering the price you kind of hope for that sort of experience I would bump up my review to a solid 35 though based on the my dessert of a fantastic sticky toffee pudding another first for me in the UK It was positively decadentOn the whole Id recommend this place maybe more so for a hot drink and a dessert just to enjoy the lovely view and keep the costs down But if youre looking for a decent meal and dont mind the price its certainly worth checking outWell it appears South Queensferry is a right wee source of buried treasureAlready a fan of the Hawes Inn I might never have discovered the Raild Bridge had Jennie and her folks not recommended it to me Its glass front looks out onto a tremendous view of the Forth and its Bridges A good start and it only gets better from thereAs happenstance had it we chose a rather inopportune weekend to hit Queensferry as there were all manner of fundraising activities on the go down at the waterfront This subsequently meant that finding a parking spot would be a feat worthy of fundraising in itselfNot wanting to spend all our time searching be for nought I ran in to see if there were any tables available Not only did the gentleman inside confirm he had space for us he would also hold onto the table until we found a space LegendFrom our table on the upper floor we were gifted a grand view of the restaurant via its impressively wide balcony area The artwork and Rail Bridge memorabilia all over the place were a constant source of conversation and entertainment my particular favourite being the illustration on the wall depicting John Fowler and Benjamin Baker demonstrating the cantilever systemThe food was gorgeous I started with the Stornoway Black Pudding and Chorizo Salad see the photo thats an order although the term salad seemed to be a formality What I was presented with was the best cut of chorizo Ive ever had from a restaurant The dish was a work of art combining two of my favourite foods and tasted as good as it looked For mains I chose the Railbridge Burger 100 Scottish beef topped with MacSweens haggis and melted cheddar served in a ciabatta bun and with chips and slaw Oh wow The bun was brilliantly soft and the burger so tasty Not often I eat a meal slowly because I dont want it to end certainly not a burgerStaff were flawless in their courtesy It seemed as if everyone who worked there was a personal acquaintance of the owner and didnt want to disappointAll reasonably priced all reasonably excellentJust had lunch here Very accommodating space for 4 adults and 2 high chairs Good baby changingWC facilitiesI ordered a pulled pork baguette which came with chips The portion was huge and chips were nice as they were done in a traditional pub lunch sort of way if u know what I mean Sadly the pulled pork was as dry as a bone albeit tasty and was in desperate need of some more sauce as it came with only a drizzle of what looked and tasted a bit like thousand island dressing This was not unpleasant but a bit odd My preference is for BBQ sauce but an apple sauce and slaw would also be nice The meal came to 44 for the four of us  not bad value if you consider portion sizes We all had baguettes and chips and soft drinks"

    "review":"Headed here for a midweek dinner last December and ate  drank very well The beef cheeks were a particular highlight and the service was some of the most attentive Ive ever experienced Thoroughly deserves its reputationWe booked using open table and advised the restaurant that we were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary  thinking they might at least acknowledge the fact to please my wife  not looking for anything just trying to embellish the celebration and the meal Zero on that score dont necessarily blame the restaurant but question why they use a system they dont fully utilize or train their staff forWe were seated promptly but noticed that other diners who came in after us were served before us and treated in a manner that was obviously different to our experience  The food was as critiqued good in every respect and the Californian wine we ordered was superbHowever the service disparity between ourselves and other diners continued where we had to ask for water and only once did service offer to top up our glasses with wine whilst others were being continuously attended to  We are benign diners polite and courteous and normally spend a lot on good food so they could not say we were bad or difficult customers to serve nontheless we felt we were treated in a lesser or disparaging mannerI will probably not revisit the experience given that factA reasonably priced reliable restaurant The food is of good quality and  is tasty Ive had the venison and duck here and they were both wellbalanced and seasoned well both times and cooked to my liking The dessert menu is average Id recommend the banana tart not a fan of the chocolate brulee  it was too creamy and heavy for me I would return hereI had no idea this restaurant was here until recently when I was invited here for a birthday meal In fact Ive realised that a lot of my reviews start this way with me not realising somewhere exists despite having spent a long time living here Anyway Im now aware of this restaurants existence and now that I know its here Ill certainly be coming back for some more of their tasty served up waresThe restaurant makes up part of the eclectic range of delights to be found on St Stephen St at both basement and street level Stockbridge Restaurant is tucked away down a set of stairs and is fairly miniature in size much like a lot of restaurants on the street but I think that gives them a lot of character and individuality although it does mean booking ahead especially at the weekendsThe look here is plush classy and well furnished If you want somewhere impressive but not too overdone by everyone in Edinburgh for some romance time or somewhere nice to take the family this restaurant is a great option The food runs along traditional lines with a stylised edge and presentation and I recall going for the pigeon to start followed by a sturdy meat option The tables are quite close together but its all good if you have a decent level of concentration Sadly Im really nosey so couldnt help but look round the restaurant a couple of times to see how a few couples dates were goingAte here on a Saturday night and have to say the food was fantastic We arrived just after 830pm and although service was a little slow to start with early diners were still finishing up we felt real cosy down off the street in the Stockbridge RestaurantMenu is sort of Scottish gourmet so plenty of local ingredients Haggis with a panoply of pork anyone delicious fresh bread great amusebouche my partner was audibly groaning at the lemon sorbet and the final quadruple  quintuple chocolate dessert with assorted mousses and choctreats was most favourably received judging by the silent and intense manner in which it was eatenThe little touches made the meal a treat like the mysterious yet delectable green dip with our bread the discrete chiller bucket for our white wine the smorgasbord of cheese I had with paper thin oat cakes the unhurried tailend to the meal with the offer of a taxi  I could go onBit pricey but what the hey  Stockbridge Restaurant gets a thumbs up from meMy second time here and this time with Yelp Eats I was happy to return after a good first experience and also for the wife and I to take two friends over from Australia out for a mealI thought the set menu had a great choice and to be honest it was the abundant of pig on offer that sold the restaurant to me The crab spring spring rolls for a starter were lovely but only made me hungry the perfect starter perhaps Then the mainpig cheek pork belly and more pig only thing missing was that it wasnt wrapped in bacon So goodLove the interior and the details and the art work Could see my paintings hanging on the walls hint hintBig thanks to Jen and Yelp for organising Yelp Eats Week look forward to the next one"

    "review":"Ive only been here once while in Edinburgh Not because it wasnt good but because its a wee bit over my price range And I guess it wasnt so good that it ever occurred to me to go back there again You can blame this on my state of mind during my first year of university thoughThe occasion was a postexam meal with a friend of mine who also studied Social Anthropology We wanted to treat ourselves and they were doing 2 courses for 10 pounds For what my memory does serve me I had risotto and that was the moment I became a risotto lover I think it was risotto with asparagus and chives I could be wrong about the latter two ingredients The atmosphere in the restaurant is really warm Maybe because the insides cozy but not too cramped As far as memory serves I recommend it though not passionatelythat might very possibly just be an effect of timeI saw the faulty towers dining experience here Best dinner show Ive ever seen in my life It is a must see wherever you are Even if you arent a fan of faulty towers you will be entertained non stopfish cake is very good it is cheap and nice It may be a bit difficult to find it But it is big inside and the steak is tasty as well recommend stronglyGroupon voucher 3 course French meal before a night out Best Why not And so it went It was a Friday night and we had booked weeks in advance The place was busy when we arrived at 8 pm The dcor quite basic but open with clean lines Im trying to think of distinguishing features that would set it apart but cant reallyThe wait staff were courteous Not exactly warm but very polite We all ordered the Haggis Tower with Neeps and Tatties with a Whiskey sauce for our starter which was delicious I asked the server if they would consider doing that as a main course if one ordered it I was told that they were still trying to maintain their identity as a French restaurant and despite its popularity the dish was not FrenchI refrained from questioning the presence of Penne Pasta and Lasagne on the menu I had a Chicken cassoulet with Toulouse sausage for my main which was simply cooked but pretty good The chicken had crispy skin the sauce was flavoursome and fortunately not greasy as cassoulets I have had before The others ordered the grilled Cod and the pasta which I was told was good too We had desserts that we shared between us The Champagne sorbet Toffee crepe and profiteroles They were all nice And that about sums up the experience NICE The fact that the meal cost me 9 for 3 courses made it excellent Would I have been happy paying 1195 for the chicken cassoulet Absolutely notWould I go back Hmmm Probably If they had another deal on and I didnt fancy cooking at home yeah maybeWe selected his restaurant because it was close to our accommodation  We noticed that there were no recent Yelp reviews but decided to take our chances  The restaurant had a few diners when we entered but was clearing out because we were entering during the tailend of the dinner hours around 8:30pm  The decor requires a make over  My adults kids ages 25 and 23 said that it reminded them of their grandmothers house  The music was loud and oddly matched to the restaurant some of it was just unrecognizable then mostly Michael Jacksons Thriller on a sound track that skipped The restaurant has a prixfix menu  We all enjoyed our starters soup of the day goat cheese app and salmon blinis and they were very accommodating to special dietary requests  My daughters chicken main dish was advertised as battered chicken was essentially chicken nuggets with French fries It looked like something you can order from a childrens menu in the States  My husbands rib eye did not look like any I have every seen  It looked more like a thin sandwich steak The first one was burned to a crisp  The waiter knew it and asked my husband when he saw him taste it  The waiter was very sorry and rushed to make changes He even gave us another bottle of wine  He was trying to make up of the the quality of food  We even heard him arguing with the chef when he returned the food  Overall this place seems like it has seen better daysWe received a coupon to go hear during a short trip to Edinburgh The maitre d was vaguely rude to us and extremely rude to the waitresses The restaurant was very busy so we were excited to get our food but it lacked flavor Both of us are huge seafood fans and we felt a little let down by our meal During the lovely walk home we both began to notice our noisy stomachs around the same time Although it wasnt fullblown food poisoning we definitely had something off from the restaurant Were both very adventurous eaters and neither of us have weak stomachs and from the nature of the illness it was pretty easy to tell that wed gotten a poorly handled piece of fish or an unfresh mussel It definitely wasnt a horrible dining experience but I wouldnt recommend the restaurant and we wont be in any hurry to dine there again"

    "review":"The reviews here are confusing so to be clear: we went for dinner after 9 pm No afternoon tea for usThis is a classy looking joint with prices to match We were lured in by the decor and a safe gastropub menu and had pretty high expectationsIt began a bit oddly as I went to place the napkin on my lap the hostess grabbed it from me quickly exclaiming that was her job Yes maam I replied The rest of the servers were equally attentive especially a very knowledgeable and friendly bartender who was giving another patron a whiskey lessonOur dinner was a classic fish and chips a bit wet and overly salty but not bad and an interesting sea trout with smoked eel also a tad on the salty side Along with a pint of porter and a cocktail we paid a pretty penny for dinner but the fun and romantic setting made up for itDont expect too much and be ready to pay and the North Bridge Brasserie could be a fun part of your evening out Note: The Scotsman Hotel has the same review as I was unaware that North Bridge Brasserie is part of the hotelThis is a great venue for many occasions this occasion was an afternoon tea with some Yelpers in one of the function rooms It was a nice big banquet table set up and we were brought to the room by one of the bartenders We were then handed to the very capable hands of a function manager  she took our coats and  sat us down  we were sat on a table with full linen and porcelain crockery Our water glasses were promptly filled Once we all sat down she placed the napkin and took our tea orders They had a full complement of loose teasI went for the famous Scotsman breakfast and an additional Jasmine green tea These are served in full sized classic teapots and strainersShe also fully explained the delight that were served to us  after ensuring that there were any dietary requirementsScones clotted cream sliders bon bons profiteroles soldier cut crustless sandwiches with salmon cucumber egg ham cheese and also some flap jacks and carrot cakesThe acoustics of the room allowed for a conversation to be followed from all over the table without getting too loud although the level of conversation topics was at times a bit questionable but that cannot be attributed to the Scotsman :oI had a wonderful time and relay enjoyed the visit This is something i would be proud to take my mum to when she visits EdinburghThe North Bridge Brasserie is the restaurant within the Scotsman hotel so if you are thinking of tea at the Scotsman this is where youll end up Its a bit confusing but nonetheless delicious regardless of what you call itWe had afternoon tea here and it was all delicious and wellserved The sandwiches are what you would usually expect  egg salad chives and sour cream and cucumber ham with mustard and something else that I cant remember but was definitely Scottish The scones were delicious and made even better so with jam and clotted cream But honestly what isnt better with jam and clotted cream I can hear my doctor wince as I write that sentence but hey its a holiday right We made a reservation in advance but on the day we were there at 16:00 it wasnt particularly busy The teas were excellent and the service was great They indulged us with group photos were accomodating to our particular requests and overall made for a delightful afternoon tea experienceThe North Bridge Brasserie is part of the Scotsman Hotel  a beautiful period building that is impressive from the outside and even more so in the inside when you get lost wandering from the main brasserie all slick dark wood to the reception past some regal looking marble stairs and then are led down an darkish corridor to a hidden room that suddenly open up into brightness light pastel colours creams and pink lillies on the table  a room that is reserved specifically for afternoon teaI have something of a Victoriana fetish After reading A Little Princess when I was 8 I wanted to be the little princess After reading The Secret Garden I used to hope and pray I would find a secret door in our old walled garden leading to a hidden garden Whilst it was an age that wasnt kind to women I still have fantasies of dressing up in period dresses with a morning dress for breakfast in the morning room a going out dress with umbrella and hat for a stroll in the garden and then a lighter frock that matches the colours of the upholstery in the afternoon tea roomThat last paragraph wasnt essential to this review but it gives some context to why I was so enamoured with afternoon tea at the North Bridge Brasserie The hidden room you can only be led to for your afternoon tea is a delight and the setting and service is definitely the closest to the oldfashioned style of afternoon tea anywhere Ive found in Edinburgh Many places do afternoon tea offering the three tiered cake stand with scones cake sandwiches and tea But thats just the food What the North Bridge Brasserie offered was the whole experienceTHey set up a table for 12 people and took all our orders accomodating gluten free vegetarian and nofish They then brought us all our afternoon delights Rather than putting everything on individual or between two cake stands they brought out all the sandwiches then all the scones then all the cakes This was more practical although did take away from the lovely feeling of all my food on one cake stand slightlyI had the gluten free option shared with Claire L The sandwiches well  you couldnt tell the difference between the gluten free bread and regular THe scones whilst slightly smaller than the regular scones were equally delicious and you couldnt tell they were gluten free I cant really complain about the size of the scones as there was so much food we got several doggie bags to take home after 6 finger sandwiches each a huge scone and at least 5 or 6 mini cakes which were all very rich On the gluten free cake stand there was the dime bar cake made with almonds Claire L tells me you can buy this in from supermarkets and at Ikea a white fudge chocolate truffle cranachan chocolate brownie mini meringue with lemon curd A lot of cakes I was envious at the lack of carrot cake and wonder if they could add more sponge like gluten free options to the gluten free cake stand using gluten free flour But again I cant complain as it was all lovelyThe tea itself was really the only lessthanlovely exprience Many people ordered earl grey myself included It was very weak no matter how long we let it brew and was distinctly lacking the earl grey flavour It was justweak all over There is nothing more pleasurable than a sip of scented bergamot earl grey tea followed by a bite of a scone lathered in clotted cream and jam It is afternoon tea after all with the emphasis on the tea So the fact that this tea was perhaps stale and lacking flavour was a bit sad and was a noticeable drop in standard given the rest of it was all exquisiteHowever I would definitely return and perhaps get a regular stronger tea This would be my highest recommendation for afternoon tea in the city Its central a 2 minute walk from Waverely Train Station in a gorgeous building fitting to the tradition and in a beautiful room with light open windows with delicious homemade food and very attentive kind service 1695 per person for the regular afternoon tea and 2095 for a glass of prosecco Rather splendidId booked her for afternoon tea and then on the day my drive shaft decided it didnt want to drive any more so snapped in half North Bridge were really decent about the minute cancellation so I rebooked for here a couple of weeks back One thing I hate about going to Edinburgh is the stairs but North Bridge has a secret street level entrance just outside Waverley Station You need to get buzzed in so I felt like Id passed some kind of test when I was allowed in Then theres an elevator to take you up the four stories to the level where afternoon tea is served its the street entrance off North Bridge which gives you an idea of how ridiculous Edinburgh is No wonder I get lost every time I go there The afternoon dining area is pretty nice although definitely has the feel of a hotel restaurant The tables are a bit too cramped for four ladies afternoon teaing at the same time For 1995 per person you get a tower of treats between two people including all the usual suspects  sandwiches desserts scones and tea or coffee I opted for a gluten free option and was pretty impressed at the selection  it all looked pretty delicious The sandwiches were nice although egg mayo sandwiches should be outlawed but I was let down by the scone which was a little rocklike and hard to eat The desserts on the top were pretty lovely and I liked the lemon posset the most Service was fine and the place wasnt particularly noisy I guess I just left with a little bit of a meh feeling about the food and wouldnt rush to return as it just wasnt the amazing afternoon tea experience Id hoped forTheyve revamped their afternoon tea in the past couple years because it was completely different than the last time I went The food tower is impressive Gone were the staid old white bread finger sandwiches replaced with an assortment of tasty sandwiches and savory pastries The scone while getting points for containing chocolate was just soso The sweet pastries were very good to eat not just pretty to look at  The service was neglectful but even with this fault and the fact that they charged us extra for ordering tea with our afternoon tea this is still a very nice option for bringing visitors to an afternoon tea The quality of the offerings is good for the price point and the setting is beautiful"

    "review":"One of the best meals Iv ever had Delicious scotch based cocktail big ball of ice w orange zest Frozen into it the chorizo and potato side was one of the best potato dishes but the star was the lamp shoulder w peas Seriously among the best plates of food that I have had The staff was exceptionally friendly felt like I was dining in someones home very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere for such a nice placeGreat food Nice selection of wineAmazing serviceKids area is perfect for a little peace and quiet while they amuse themselves with toys  books and DVDsWhats not to likeWhile in Edinburgh for a short weekend I could not wait to taste some good local foodI heard about this place on a French blog and pinned it down on my phone I did not make any reservation so we got there around noon on a Saturday and were able to get a tableThe place is nicely decorated: you feel like home and I have no doubt that this was meant to On Saturday lunch its family time but still the place is not noisy and the staff is SO nice sorry as a Parisian I am definitely not used to thatWhat about food Well most of products are locally sourced the menu changes depending on arrivals and seasons but youll surely find some regulars like the steak pieI had the pork belly boudin braised cabbage and kale which I was quite worried to discover In french boudin means black pudding and well I really dont like it But from what I understood this was different Indeed It was generous tasty vegetables were crunchy and the sauceyummyI was definitely satisfied with that lunch: these people serve food with their heart They do not intend to seduce critics hipsters or whatever specified crowd I really felt like I had lunch at my grandmas while I was so away from homeMy heart still warms up remembering that delicious lunchThank you Edinburgh thank you the food sceneThis was the restaurant I most wanted to visit on my trip to Edinburgh after reading multiple reviewsrecommendations of it on blogs and it was delicious It is a really pretty upscale gastropub  decorated in what I would call highlands chic tartan designs on the chairs mismatched furniture The menu is also upscale pub food and it was delicious They have a great beer list and we started with a flight of beer taste of Scotland which was a fun way to start For dinner I had the risotto and my mom the steak pie  both were top notch We shared the brownie dessert All the desserts are paired with cocktails or beerwines which was a fun touch They offered to call us a cab which made it easy to get back to our hotel in the old city Overall a fun place to experience a little more of the local Edinburgh off the royal mile and a delicious  Scottish mealIts horrible to be rush out Of your table because the restaurant wants to Make more money and sit the next clients  We didnt even wasted any time as deserts were order well before we finished the main course very bad experience : also the fish dish hake was old and fishy  The desert was good Hake was horrible  Ate really fast had desert while our party was finishing the main and unfortunately was asked to leave by the employees as soon as we paid check being told another party was waiting at the bar for the table  Rather rude to ask us to leave"

    "review":"Great place to take the kids as staff are great with them Food is very good and drinks not too expensive considering on George Street Some great music memorabilia as you would expectA good addition to the HRC worldwide collection of restaurants HRC Edinburgh is pretty par compared with other HRCs Depending on how busy it is the service quality and speed can vary wildly  but if you love your burgers and you cant help but buy a HRC glass from every restaurant you visit that would include me then its worth a visit The Twisted Mac and Cheese side order for 495 was really small so if youre thinking of going for that as a main meal you might want to think again No lunchtime specials or anything like that but the waiter did ask if I had any discountsvouchers when going for the bill Beware of 1015 service charge added to all totals over 30Caro demasiado ruidoso Paguei 24 pounds por um prato de salmoe uma taa de vinho Os estamos noreino unido   Servicio eh timo  pero nocompensa Secomemuitomelhor ea parece mto mais justo no tigerlilyHard Rock Edinbugh is a bit like a smaller version of the original in London its lowceilinged and therefore more intimate feeling than most which is in many ways a good thing Theres strangely a bit of a lack of one of the cornerstones of Hard Rock  memorabilia It may be because its one of the older ones so maybe a refresh is in order The staff in all HRCs in my experience are great specifically selected for their sunny disposition which acts as a great antithesis to my own Its hard not to like themWe got sat down in one of the booths ordered my partners cocktail and my beer and then barely looked at the menu Why well cos I almost know it backwards I went for the Chicken Tenders followed by the Local Legendary Burger and and my partner went for the Chicken WingsThe chicken tenders were not bad at all the batter was just a tiny bit undercooked on the inside but it was crispy on the outside Just slightly overcrisped for me The chicken was moist and the dip was nice well the white one was I never bother with the red one The burger though it was a bit underwhelming for a start the burger was unexciting and arguably underseasoned and the Local part of the Local Legendary Burger was barely discernible Apparently its the same as the HRC Glasgow recipe but it wasnt There was a fraction of the haggis and none of the whisky sauce It was still not bad though and yes the fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the insideHaving been to six Hard Rocks in the last year  Lisbon Madrid Glasgow London Manchester and now Edinburgh maybe Im getting a little jaded Im no stranger to the Edinburgh one but havent been there for a few years It was still an above average burger meal but it failed to hit all the high notes and theres a lot more competition out there now so out of my six HRC experiences this last year Im afraid it definitely rates at no 6Amazing amazing amazing  We visited Hard Rock Cafe Edinburgh for a friends birthday and the food was incredible we had the jumbo combo to start with and it was like nothing we have had ever before very delicious  Our main courses were yummy and they even sang Happy Birthday for my friend and they received a lovely birthday dessert  All the staff went above and beyond to make our visit really special we cant wait for our next trip to Hard Rock Cafe EdinburghI realise that theres nothing that remarkable about a Hard Rock Cafe in itself or there being one in Edinburgh for that matter but seeing as they are pretty different depending on what city youre in I thought this establishment and tourist magnet of worldwide recognition would be worth reviewingWhen I lived in Barcelona for a while I actually used to hang out in the Hard Rock Cafe there quite a lot which I never thought I would find myself doing It turned out that the cocktails were amazing and just the right level of potent and the banter was great because there was always such a mix of people milling around The premises were also huuuuge and with a pretty striking HQ right on the central square in the middle of Barcelona it was quite hard not to enjoy the whole thingI suppose thats why I find Hard Rock Cafe in Edinburgh a little bit underwhelming but I suppose its not totally fair to compare it to the one in Barcelona its not its fault its small and feels a wee bit cramped The mix of tourists and locals blasting rock music huge portions of food and hard hitting cocktails are all here though and I do enjoy all of those things Sometimes a large portion of nachos or a hefty burger and chips is just the ticket"

    "review":"After walking past this place time after time I finally decided to go in and see what all the fuss was about at lunch time This was further provoked by the fact they finally took down the scaffolding that had been obstructing it for the best part of last semesterThere are comfy couches and a few tables but its not huge by any means The staff are lovely and friendly and do not try and rush you with your choice just because its busy I am a picky eater I had a Danish pastry and a tea all very yummy but my friends sundried tomato mozzarella and basil pesto was delicious and the bread was soft and freshDefinitely stands out from its neighbouring sandwich bars and great to grab something and head for the Meadows in the sunBonningtons certainly holds its own against the wide range of sandwich bars available on Clerc Street  The service is friendly and always seems pleased to see you as well as accomodate your every sandwich need  Where Bonningtons surpasses its local competition is in the quality and variety of ingredients it makes available for baguettes and sandwiches  Every time I visit I spend at least two minutes pondering which cold meat would marry best with which sauce or types of salad  The last time I was in I had pork with apple sauce which was delicious and only cost 2 Although having not tried it myself I noticed that Bonningtons are the only Edinburgh stockists of Caithness Cheeses from north Scotland a tribute to the range and scope of their produce My one criticism of the delicatessen would be however that the shop itself feels a little dark and from the outside can seem almost uninviting This is a shame and does not do justice to the quality of the food and service inside which is truly excellent without the extortionate price tagA relatively new addition to the cafs adorning Nicholson street Bonningtons is without doubt the best sandwich bar around With a huge range of high quality ingredients this is a must for anyone who likes create your own sandwiches They have everything dried meats the serrano ham is almost as good as in Spain sausages bacon about 4 or 5 different flavoured types of chicken meatballs ham falafel hummus loads of different cheeses olives jalapenos all the salad you could want and a multitude of sauces As well as this you have about 6 or 7 different types of bread to choose from The garlic paste is great as are the olives with serrano ham and brieIf you cannot make up your mind however the owner is more than welcome to help out As it is at the end of my road I often stop in for lunch and there have been many times I have asked for something like a club sandwich with a twist or other requests and 10 minutes later I have a sandwich masterpiece in my hands If even this is too uncertain for you though they have pre packaged sandwiches which can all be heated if thats what you wantAs well as sandwiches they have loads of drinks although there are no Innocent Smoothies any more they have been replaced by another brand equally as nice Also available are nibbles and as well as the normal crisps and chocolate bars they sell wasabi peas a few different flavoured nuts and excellent cakes including an awesome brownie and rocky road The owner is really friendly and is constantly experimenting with his ingredients offering advice on what he likes Currently under refurbishment now but open again in a few days he plans to install as PS3 and Xbox so people can play whilst waiting for their food  Which other sandwich bars can you say that about Sandwiches normally cost about 2503 but with Snapfax you can get 20 off so who can argue with a great sarnie for about 2 quid Certainly not meGood coffee great sandwiches and very nice peopleBonningtons has only recently relocated to Newington from Leith and I for one am glad that it didIts true Edinburgh has its fair share of sandwich delis but something about Bonningtons puts it a cut above the rest The service is always friendly usually with the same 2 or 3 people working there and so you very quickly become a recognised regular Unlike a lot of other sandwich delis of this type Bonningtons very rarely runs out of filling ingredients so youre always guaranteed to get the exact sandwich youre afterThats the best thing about this place  no matter how bizarre your request they are always happy to oblige and they arent stingy with the fillings either You can get your food to go or slouch on their comfy leather sofas with a gorgeous cappuccino for a spot of peoplewatching on busy Clerk Street outsideYou cant beat it for price either whether you get one of your own bespoke creations tailormade to order or one from their selection of sandwiches freshly made that day Id recommend the Goats Pyjamas with Sunblushed tomatoes tangy goats cheese basil pesto and roast aubergine you can expect to pay as little as 250350 If you have to buy lunch on the go and youre within a 10mile radius go herewe tried the flat white milk temperature was good on the cool side strength and flavour was good but no real milk texture that would have lifted it  a good option though if youre in the area especially if youre hungry as there are heaps of good sandwich options :"

    "review":"This somewhat accidentally seems to have become our goto place in Edinburgh when meeting friends This is partly down the location with George IV Bridge being central to most of our city adventures  but also because its simply a good place to beIts predominantly a cocktail bar or at least has always been marketed that way for as long as I have been going  sporadically over several years now Its a big cocktail menu each one made with care by an experienced and energetic staff  and Ive not had a bad one yet Real highlights include the Burntisland Iced Tea and the Lychee Rose Martini Ive had some other nice drinks from here theres usually an interesting beer or two at least in bottle form and in the winter months Ive been treated to warm spiced ciderThey do now have a big focus on food with the back area now sectioned off exclusively for those hoping to dine with their wine or cocktails Ive only eaten a couple of times but both times were fantastic The first I enjoyed a winter warmer of chorizo and chickpea stew in a really delightfully rich sauce The second was good old sausage and mash but jazzed up a bit No complaints there everything is very tasty and leaves you wanting more Even the tap water brought in a jug full of mint and cucumber is instantly refreshing and better than your standard bar fare Great stuffThe only downside is that its a little small especially now since the majority of space is reserved for eating If you want to meet friends for drinks only there arent many tables and the long bar reduces standing room  and then of course the background music is often blasted out at a volume that means you cant hear your friends anymore But that aside: if you come when its a little quieter: the staff food and drinks will make you want to return BrilliantWarm and cozy place Delicious lunch Im not a drinker and the bartender made me a fantastic mocktail The crispy lamb is out of this world Made like pork belly Warm and wonderful staff In fact it was so yummy we came back for dinner the next dayMy family and I stumbled upon this place when headed to the museum and were in for a treat We enjoyed each dish my mother having an eggplant dish I having a salad with chicken and my father having a fish dish if I remember correctlyThis place is very near a lot of local attractions and being in the middle of many other eateries it makes a statement I really enjoyed it and would go again when in EdinburghWe came to the Villager thinking it was an upscale pub but its really more of a cocktail barlounge For dinner we were seated on sofas around a low table which would have been comfortable for drinks but was a bit awkward for a meal I tried one of their many cocktails a play on an oldfashioned with smoky Scotch The food was fine albeit a little expensive for something simple like the vegetarian platter with good fish and chips We had better pub food in Edinburgh but it was certainly nothing to complain about The real problem was the service which was sporadic and inattentive I think we came in during a shift change because our original waitress disappeared and was replaced after a period of time by another waiter When we tried to pay the credit card reader couldnt read our cards  another frustration Overall it was a fine meal but Id say this is a better spot for cocktails and snacks than dinnerOoh dear I think I came here on a bit of an off nightI came here for a bite and a drink before Yelps May elite event because it is perfectly placed between my work  When we arrived there were loads of tables available and the friendly waitress brought us some of their famously tasty water with cucumber watermelon and mintWe all ordered drinks and theyd been advertising their cocktail of the week online which I thought sounded pretty good  The waitress didnt know what I was talking about and though the bar seemed to know they ended up charging me more for it than was actually advertised  Admittedly I didnt point this out because I was in a bit of a rush by then and it seemed petty to squabble over 60p but I did find it an unfortunate oversight  Two of us ordered their tasty cajun potato wedges and we agreed that we should have ordered one to share  That didnt stop us from finishing both bowls though  My other friend ordered a burger which when it first came out was undercooked to the extent that he had to go against his cardinal rule of never sending food back and send it back  The waitress was very nice about it and the kitchen recooked the burger and reported that some of the red colour came from the spices used  This is fine and they handled it perfectly fine but it does seem odd that a place that makes burgers daily would actually churn one out that was SO undercooked  So all in all a pretty meh experience  Having said that I would definitely return because as I said I felt that Id caught the Villager on something of an off night  It has an impressive cocktail list nice staff great location and good ambiance  I look forward to trying a proper meal here and reporting backTo me the Villager feels like a regular bar that thinks its really cool except it isnt The staff have a bit of a wannabe hipster vibe The food is standard gastropub fare and does the job without too much problem The last time I had food I had a burger which was a bit dry and just alrightThe staff were pretty snobby on my most recent visit they came over as proper draconian on the whole you will definitely have to move from this seat because someone might want food at some point in the near future even though this table isnt booked Five women drinking cocktails over the course of two hours is apparently not a priority for the bar despite the likely higher bill for 8 per drink We got hassled quite a few times about where we were sitting and it was irritating to feel that as paying customers we werent as important as people eatingOn the plus side the location is excellent and its often chosen as an inoffensive place to meet up with friends for catch ups Dont expect anything exciting  its hipster vibe feels a bit tired and obvious"

    "review":"Vibrantly painted walls in this quaint basement restaurant Good food and a lively atmosphere RecommendedIve eaten here a number of times in the past including one Xmas dinner and can safely say Ive had no complaints about the service or food Likewise the upstairs bar does the job with a good range of most types of alcohol What surprised myself and my companions last weekend though was to see Innis  Gunn available on draught Surprise number two came when we found out it was 650 a pint Needless to say no pints were bought The price is no doubt set against what the supplier charges the bar but this is beer made in Scotland not Leffe which is the same strength but at least imported Given that you can get the bottled versions for not much more than a quid in Morrisons I think Ill be sticking to that optionAuthentic quaint Scottish bistro restaurant with pleasant atmosphere and wonderfully friendly and helpful staff  Food is excellent Were visiting Edinburg for the weekend and we enjoyed our first visit so much to A Room in the West End that were going back again tomorrowI want to give this place more than just three stars because I actually had an incredibly lovely evening here last night  However the loveliness of my evening was due almost entirely to the company I was with as well as the friendliness of the wait staff  The food was what really fell short hereand the chairs the incredibly uncomfortable chairs  It was by no means bad but it just didnt WORK very well For starters I had pumpkin gnocchi with shredded ham hock slow roasted cherry tomatoes  bocconcini  It was nice and definitely my favorite dish of the evening  The texture of the gnocchi was a bit unusual but ultimately the flavors of the dish went together nicely  Also considering the size of the dish it was a bargain at 595  However as it was a starter I didnt want it to be that large  It filled me up to the point I where I didnt need anything else to eat and I hadnt even finished itMy friend had the smoked halibut baby spinach  goats cheese roulade with radish  watercress salad roast yellow pepper  Arran mustard vinaigrette  She asked if the yellow pepper could be left off and they kindly replaced it with a reduced balsalmic though to be honest I never noticed balsalmic anything  We swapped starters so I had the chance to try this one as well  The goats cheese roulade completely overwhelmed the halibut in both size and flavor  The proportion of cheese to fish seemed to indicate that one was expected to take large mouthfuls of cheese with a tiny sliver of fish as an accompaniment  I like cheese as much as the next person but it was simply too much  Even tiny accents of the cheese taken with the fish overwhelmed the flavor and ultimately I managed only a few bites before I gave up uninterested    After our massive starters even stretched out over about an hour and a half we werent hungry in the least  Feeling too guilty to spend so much time at the table and have only wine and starters we ordered a main to share  We chose the braised Portobello mushrooms stuffed with black crowdie on a borlotti bean white cabbage plum tomato  basil stew confit garlic coulis  The mushrooms were nice but the black crowdie had the texture of hard styrofoam and the beans were undercooked to the point of being hard  The flavors and presentation were all quite nice but the individual elements were extremely lacking  This dish was also immense and there is NO way I could have finished it aloneWe also noticed that all mains are served with a small side of steamed vegetables  new potatoes carrots broccoli and snow peas  Im not sure why they do this because while we all love veggies they didnt compliment the dish and it doesnt seem they would compiment anything on the menu I certainly didnt need any more food and really just think that the restaurant is wasting money on a completely unnecessary extra  The icing on the cake was when I was sitting in bed later that evening and my stomach was rumbling unhappily  Not with hunger and certainly not as a result of overeating but clearly unimpressed by the subpar meal"

    "review":"Really lovely little restaurant Went last week for the pretheatre menu 11 for three courses on a recommendation The decor is nice and laid back all pretty things but very comfortable and unassumingThe food was excellent all of our dishes were deliciousIll have to make a return visit at some point one of out fellow diners had the bone marrow which unfortunately was not on the set menu which definitely piqued my interestHaving a bit of a nightmare trying to find somewhere with a table for lunch in the BruntsfieldMorningside area recently and with a vegetarian and a vegan in tow I remembered I had liked the look of Bia Bistrot They can not only adapt dishes for vegans as well as those with gluten nut and dairy intolerances they had a special 3course menu available with advanced warningThe restaurant is cosy relaxed comfortable and well lit also with a large dining area downstairs Staff are very friendly and know their menufoodTheres a set menu offering two courses for 950 or three for 11 which considering the quality of food served is great value Theres also daily changing specials making great use of fresh seasonal and sometimes more unusual ingredients On the specials menu the day I visited were Wolffish and Sebaste I have never tried Wolffish before and had never even heard of Sebaste They were out of Wolffish so I went for the Sebaste I eat more seafood than anything else to the point I am surprised I dont have gills It was served with romanesco confit potato and olive tapenade The flavours were huge The Sebaste turned out to be very meaty and juicy A lot like Monkfish The tapenade nutty romanesco and potatoes were an ideal match for the fish It was seasoned and cooked to perfectionWe were all so impressed we decided that it was to be the venue for an upcoming Birthday Although ill definitely be back before thenHands down  this is my favourite restaurant in EdinburghFresh  seasonal  local  sustainable  homemade boasts the brand new Bia Bistrot menu I mentioned in my review of George Hughes  Son Fish Emporium note not a fishmonger how important I and a lot of preachy TV chefs feel using local sustainable produce is so this is good to seeThe menu is fairly simple and I like this Convoluted overly long menus really put me off a place Ranging from leek red onion and blue cheese tartlet to beef rump with potatoes and pepper sauce Bia Bistrot has something to cater to everyone Prices are fair Not cheap but fair And the food is delicious They also do a pre theatre menu for 9 2 courses or 1050 3 courses which is pretty reasonable Its also very tastefully decorated which makes for a nice atmosphere Being off the main road means you dont get any of the Morningside through traffic noise either A really promising place Less sure about the spelling thoughIt is always great to find a place that prides itself on using fresh seasonal and local food and Bia Bistrot certainly didnt disappoint What made it even better for us was how wonderfully baby friendly the place was completed with delightfully friendly staff We were in for Mothers day lunch and the menu they had on was a delightful selection of dishes Their starter of asparagus poached egg and herb salad made my day as the asparagus was wonderfully sweet and the egg was poached to perfection My husbands starter of mackerel complete with perfectly crispy skin and rhubarb was gone in a flash and our son was delighted with the piece he was given to nibbleMy main of free range chicken breast was cooked so well it was full of flavor and the meat was still tender and moist and was accompanied by a lovely little smoked chicken pasty and some very tasty braised leeks My husbands main of slow roasted pork didnt disappoint either and had fantastic crackling and beautifully flavored meat We also shared a side of garlic potatoes which i very highly recommend as well as there homemade wheaten stout bread that we had as a nibble before out starters came it really wet the palletTo finish off I had the gorgeous chocolate pot that came with a shot of hazelnut liquor and melt in the mouth shortbread i couldnt have had a better end to my meal while my husband enjoyed some wonderful Aged Mull Cheddar Their menu is fairly priced great fresh food at a great price They offer an a la carte menu as well as a set menu of 2 courses for 9 or 3 courses for 1050 offered between 12pm  2:30pm and 5pm  6pmThere wine selection is good and they offer a great range of real ales much to my husbands delightIf you love local seasonal food then this is definitely a place that you need to try and we will certainly be frequenting there againA coworker took me out to Bia Bistrot for my birthday the other week 24 November if you have your diaries out   Neither of us had been since it changed from an Olive Branch and that coupled with its very convenient location made it a must try  They advertise a two course lunch or dinner for a very reasonable priceI generally cant be bothered with two courses for lunch so was pleased when the waitress was happy to let us order single courses off the set menuMy coworker decided to try the cumberland sausage with mash and I went for a salad with poached egg and haggisI heard good things about the sausage and mash but probably not as good as my salad  Id never thought of putting haggis on a salad before  I dont really know why Ill put any other type of meat on a salad  but wow this was fantastic  The haggis was sliced so it had a crispy outside but broke apart easily and went wonderfully witih the salad leavesI do love a good poached egg but I am very very very picky and this one unfortunately was pretty underdone to my taste  I have to have a liquid yolk but absolutely cant stand if the white is anything but completely cooked  If I can do it at home why is it so much of a stuggle to find that when Im paying someone to cook the egg for meIn any case the food was in general quite nice and the wine and service were excellent  Two mains and two glasses of wine came to 22  a wee bit more expensive than I would have expected for lunch but overall very nice  I would definitely come here again"

    "review":"Caught in the busy evening dining traffic we looked high and low for a bite to eat  Finally the young lady running the show at Prezzo found us a table for two even though we had no reservation  The service at Prezzo was a bit slower than were used to but the wait was worth it  Both of us went light which in Prezzo speak means half a serving and a salad  My pizza and my ladys pasta were both delicious and the salads were fresh and crisp  The light servings were generous and filling  We have no problem recommending Prezzo for light Italian farefood was ok but no salad dressing with my salad and not enough toppings on the pizza i would not go back but it was not bad if you are hungry and want decent foodWell where to start with Prezzo After having been to the one on St Vincent Street in Glasgow I decided I would take my quite fussy chum here on the basis that she likes pasta and pizza and doesnt eat much meat I really dont think this visit was ever going to live up to the one I had in Glasgow firstly the building it is in here is far less grandiose and doesnt look like anything special at allThen there was the service the girl was perfectly pleasant smiling and welcoming BUT I think we must have waited about 10 minutes before they came over asking for our order we hadnt even been asked up until this point if we would like drinks which we certainly did Then after ordering there was a dreadful wait for these much desired drinks to arrive which was rather infuriatingOn to the food it was good It is nothing spectacular and for the price I think it is a good deal for a quick and tasty meal but it is nothing I couldnt make at home My friend decided to be healthy and have a light option of flatbread pizza with salad I was surprised at the size it was really rather small considering I had a whole pizza for the same price and she was rather disappointed with the unadventurous small salad Then came the waiting again This time to pay We had to call someone over after waiting with the card on the table for 10 or 15 minutes Then not only had we been waiting but as the staff seem a little discombobulated a young girl came over expecting us to pay AGAINSo the overall verdict Food is tasty much what I expected Service left a lot to be desired especially having worked as a waitress myself they just are not quite on the ballId been meaning to visit Prezzo for a while so was glad to finally get round to it Their pizzas are OK but its all just a bit uninspiring for meOverall we said: Prezzo was fine Their pizzas were pretty good but the overall impression I will leave with is that they understaff their restaurants Our waitress was lovely but she was fighting a losing battle to effectively manage things So the verdict is Prezzo is a safe but unimaginative choice Id recommend you go elsewhere for your Italian treats there are many better places for you to sampleA nice place Fetching ambiance quality food and pretty good value for money friendly service convenient location This place makes for an easy nostress meal outWeve been to this Prezzo a few times and while theres no denying that its a chain restaurant along the same lines as Pizza Express Zizzis etc there are a couple of highlights which keep us coming back for moreThe food is fairly standard with a good selection of pizza and pasta dishes and a nice specials menus to keep things interesting Theres also the reliability that comes from a big chain weve never had a bad meal hereThe location is the real bonus grab a seat by the side window if you can and youll be rewarded with great views of North Bridge and Carlton HillA couple of comments mentioned slow service but weve never had a problem In fact on our last visit we watched one waitress deal with an incredibly difficult customer with the grace of a saint but there does seem to be quite high staff turnover which could explain the difference in experiencesOverall I dont think Prezzo is ever going to blow someone away but its a solid pick with decent food at reasonable prices"

    "review":"Enjoyed reasonably good service here one afternoon a few weeks back Where the place has a slight issue is the size of its sharing options The option we ordered the Turkish one didnt look a great deal bigger than what Id have hoped to receive if ordering the one person option Otherwise its a pretty comfy and spacious place to relax for a whileI ordered the smoked haddock poached egg hollandaise sauce and paired with cappuccino Delicious Very gracious service nice and clean atmosphere lovely background musicPickle and Custard is as prime a spot as any for people watching plonked at a busy crossroads in a locale that sees suits and tourists jostle for space with some grubbier characters I had a perfectly enjoyable visit the other day and am surprised to see ol Pickly has taken quite a slating elsewhereStarbucks aside its usually slim pickings if you want to find someplace to have coffee and a cake after five but the Pickle welcomes caffeinedeprived punters with open arms well beyond sundown We wolfed our beverages and choccy cakes down with no complaints and the staff were unusually chirpy in a city where dourfaced dismissal is standard practiceThe soundtrack was maybe a bit banging for a place that advertises afternoon tea but at least it stood out from the acoustic landfill youd hear elsewhere as your trembling clammy hands reach for that third double espressoDelivered everything I was looking for Full marksMy bus route takes me past this corner of Lothian Road all the time But for some reason while I was out today this cute purple cafebar caught my eye for the first timeId never noticed it before then and was aptly charmed by the name My husband and I decided to drop in for lunch A champion move as it promptly began snowing buckets just afterThe inside is cozy and relatively spacious and clean Everything except what might have been our rather dingy old table looked relatively new and shiny and purple too The menu isnt too expansive but my husband and I both vegetarians managed to find several options to chose from And they ended up being lovely The tartines open faced sandwiches were delicious and we added a tomato and mushroom soup that I honestly wished I had a recipe for Even better the prices for the tartines were pretty cheap and came with a side salad and small bowl of crispsNot a bad place if youre looking to meet up with friends or want a quick bite before going to see a movie at the Odeon or fancy a coffee The bar looked somewhat wellstocked too but thats a venture for another day :Pickle  Custard is a recently opened cafebistrobar on the corner of Lothian Rd and Morrison St Id passed it a few times it looked like a comfortable spot and always seemed busy I checked out the menu online and stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunchIts a nice space clean bright and warm if a bit sparsely furnished The menu reads well theres a good selection of breakfastbrunch options and lighter bites as well as some tasty sounding open sandwiches I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki It was very tasty the chicken well flavoured and moist Served with a pitta a rather watery Tzatziki and some unwashed leaf that didnt match the quality of the souvlaki We also ordered the Turla Turla Turkish ratatouille sharer The ratatouille itself was pleasant a mix of roasted veg in spices However at 1295 offered appalling value As nice as it was the ratatouille barely served one there was half a pitta each and it came the same watery tzatziki and a distinctly bland hummusService didt fare much better It was slow and the staff were inattentive and disorganised We had to order our second round of drinks at the bar only to never receive them yet still be charged apparently theyd gone to the wrong tablePickle  Custard is still in its infancy and teething problems are expected so hopefully theyll improve Ill look forward to trying some of the appetising sounding sandwiches but wont return in a hurry With so many great places to eat around Lothian RdTollcross it has a lot of work to do to match the competitionPickle and Custard and its predecessors have a great location on Lothian Road however Im not sure I am that enthralled with the place Online the menu looked awesome but when we reached the place it was a lot shorter and lacked the options that me and my hungry friends had picked out I ended up plumping for a soupsandwich combo The tomato and courgette soup was a winner but my roast vegetable wrap was barely warmed through I opted for a tea Active which came in the largest teapot but so strong I had to pull the waitress over for hot water to dilute it down Waitresses who really were not appreciating my many requests hot water tomato sauce salt and grew a little huffier every time I asked for something else there is a great solution to that  asking if we have everything we need rather than dropping plates and scooting off like a scalded cat The meal was surprisingly more expensive than I had anticipated and whilst it was nice I am not sure I was overly impressed its a shame  it showed more promise than it delivered"

    "review":"This classy Indian restaurant has a great reputation throughout Edinburgh for better than average cuisine of a spicy nature so after a strenuous  afternoon of shopping at the nearby Ocean Terminal shopping centre my mother and I decided this was definitely the moment for a curry with matching tasty nan breadAs my mother and I are both pretty indecisive people when it comes to choosing anything from a menu that has more than one thing on it the helpful waiter chap recommended quite a few dishes for us We went for the Murgh Masallam and actually I think the other dish was a good old Tikka Masala which I know is a pretty unadventurous dish to go for but it tasted so good Add some garlic nan bread and pilau rice and you have yourself one awesome mealAptly being near the water and the Royal Yacht Britania the restaurants interior is very nautical with a lot of blue and sail decoration on the go so you do feel like you could be eating in someones large yacht I should also add that not only does Britannia Spice offer Indian food it also has a range of Bangladeshi Nepali and Thai cuisine on the menuThe lamb chop starter is the best tasting starter I have ever tried at an Indian restaurantBest place to go for a curry in leith The staff are very friendly If you want anything off the menu they will do I love chicken and prawns in any dish There is car parking available and a holiday inn across the streetCool staff I am not a lamb lover but the curried lamb chops here were AMAZING Also had MURGH CHANDI TIKKA which is Cubes of chicken marinated with spices and herbs roasted and served with a special sauce Very goodThis is worth a try Very good foodAfter going for a family meal here recently I would certainly go back The food and service was brilliant The Britannia Spice Restaurant is situated just on the corner of Commercial Street When inside the restaurant is quite spacious and its interior certainly is influenced by the nautical history of Leith with ships galore memorabilia on the walls and it even has a ships wheel So youre satisfied by the decor but what about the food Well the food certainly beats the decor am afraid The portions are generous and we did not have to wait long to get our starters and then our main courses The starters were tasty with the pakora and samosas going down a treat The tikka masala and jaipuri were bursting full of flavours while the nan bread was ideal The service was top notch even though the restaurant was quite busy not full but still busy enough to keep the staff on their toes A great place to eat in LeithBritannia Spice is the place to come for Indian food that is definitely a cut above your average curry house at above average prices as well  When I came with some friends we were well impressed by our meals and found that although the menu boasted a bewildering array of different dishes of the selection we tried everything was extremely tasty indicating that theyve not been overambitious in offering food from such varied geographical areas from Nepal to ThailandHowever somehow I cant recommend the atmosphere of this large restaurant perhaps because with its nautical theme its so overtly aimed at tourists whove just visited the nearby Royal Yacht Britannia  I kind of felt sorry for the waiters for having to wear absurd sailor costumes while the overall vibe is of an astute moneymaking franchise rather than of a friendly familyrun businessThe quality of food just about makes up for this defect though"

    "review":"I received an email questionnaire about my experiences dining at Turquoise Thistle I have duly completed this and returned it  I am really hopeful that they can do better going forward it is already positive that they are looking at feedback commentsI went for champagne afternoon tea with my husband  it is a bit of a mixed review because The food was fantastic but the service wasnt good at all From our table we could see the staff standing chatting up at the back of the restaurant  When a waitress passed all four tables that were in needed something I had to ask for fresh tea additional plates milk I appreciate that it can be a hard balance to look after your customers without fussing too much but we were left to our own devices At no point did anyone ask if we were ok  Even when we left not so much as an acknowledgement from the staff There is potential here as the food was top notch but They need to pull up their socks on serviceThe place itself is fresh and bright and very comfy seating  There was art work for sale on the wall and I was seriously tempted by a painting Please see my attached pictures of our food  The chef has done a great job putting the afternoon tea together I am vegetarian and got a really delicious croissant with Mediterranean veg  The little biscotti were the perfect crunch and the mini doughnut was delicious with the jam  I agree with the previous review by Blythe that this place has potential but a little more work neededPoor DisappointingThis is the 2nd ever place Ive scored this low in a month Now either Ive turned even more crabbit than normal or Ive had amazingly bad luck with restaurants recently I like to think the latter :This was my second visit here using an itison voucher deal After the first crappy experience with bad service and appallingly cremated food or i think it used to be food at some point i vowed never to go back however someone bought my mum a voucher for her birthday and she asked me to go with her Having such low expectations I thought surely it cant be worse than the last time Boy was I wrong The voucher consisted of a cocktail and a starter and main meal each I opted for a mojito which in the spectrum of cocktail quality was probably rated in the lower end Very amateur the kind anyone could rustle up in their house NOT the quality one would expect from their cocktail bar However this in itself isnt a deal breaker The service was slooooooowwwwww Far too long waiting for the drinks order to be taken then compounded by an inexcusable wait for the starter Im talking about an hour The menu was small and contained poorly designed choices in my opinion This is either a sign of an inexperienced chef or a way to penny pinch and skimp for us pesky voucher buyers  No decent restaurant in their right mind would offer 2 mediocre vegetarian soups in the same menu one a chilled tomato soup at that Yuch and a chicken liver pt which they replaced with salmon as they had run out Chicken replaced with fish Riiiiiight As a nonfish eater after asking if the chef could do anything else for me as I didnt like any of the starter options the waitress discussed salad options going through the types of cheeses nuts fruits etc i liked for including in the salad Initially I thought it a good sign they were willing to accommodate me After the obscenely long wait which was explained away as the chef specially preparing my salad what appeared was a very small bowl of hairy salad you know the cheap curly bitter stuff that nobody likes dressed in olive oil no other flavouring and some finely sliced sun dried peppers well I THINK they were peppers but they were so chewy and wouldnt actually break down upon chewing they were totally inedible The waitress had the grace to look embarrassed but I lost all respect for her when she asked me if it looked ok I was like whilst poking at it with my fork errrrrr Im not sure what the long wait was for There is literally nothing in this salad No response After eating a couple if hairy curly bitter salad leaves I left it No comment from the waitress as she sheepishly removed my plate My mums smoked salmon wasnt much better which was served with an unpleasantly bitter Lemon mayonnaise For the main I chose loin of pork as did my mum The only other options were sea bass and an artichoke tart After about 40 minutes during which we watched everyone else get served clearly not voucher holders and who I can only presume to be some kind of manager crane his neck at our table from the back of the restaurant a couple of times to see if our food had arrived before scurrying into the kitchen didnt have the balls to actually come to the table himself and apologise we walked out Our Views were strongly expressed at reception as to how shoddy the experience was from start to finish and how wed never be back People who buy vouchers are not second class citizens and just because its Prepaid does not give a restaurant the excuse to serve any old slop in whatever time frame they feel like The fact this voucher was a gift made it even more embarrassing as we had to let the buyer know what happened so they could complain and get a refund This was exactly the same during my first visit shortly after they first opened Youd think that such a nicely decorated place ideally situated on the east end side of queen street and attached to a boutique hotel would learn from their mistakes NopeI think promising is perhaps the best word for Turquoise Thistle Situated in the Hotel Indigo on York Place its a smart restaurant space with a nice adjoining bar area Lunch is reasonably priced at 1295 for two courses 1495 for three It lacks something though and a number of the dishes have room for improvement However the beef shin currently on their menu is very good so its worth a visit simply to sample that dishSo overall we said: Turquoise Thistle was pretty decent I get the impression that theres a really good restaurant waiting to happen here but things just need to be approached with a little more confidence Dishes were well thought out but lacked a little in the execution The place is likely to suffer from lack of lunchtime footfall while the tram works are going on in York Place but will serve its hotel patrons rather nicely I can imagine that Ill be back in the future I hope to see them building on the success of their friendly service and stylish premises as well as that excellent beef dish which was a real winner"

    "review":"Must remember in future: dine before a climb  at least an energy bar otherwise you end up leaving starving and ready to eat anything well OK almost and perhaps not seagull Fortunately our first stop was Ocean Spice and it didnt disappoint We were greeted by the most chirpiest of characters at the order area who kept us entertained while our meal was prepared even helfuly suggesting a way to reheat the food without drying it out knowing we had a long trip home The food  it was good not particularly greasy and was pretty tasty overall  generous portions too The naan were a little dry  but we did have a 20min drive home so not sure if that was down to the trip or the naan itself so will leave that one up for discussion Either way it you live in the area Ocean Spice will keep you and your empty tummies happy on any a nightMy OH is allergic to nuts so we keep slim not really  we can still have Pizza by not being able to order takeaways from Indian Thai or Chinese establishments  just to be safe However recently Ive been shown that I quite like certain curry and am addicted to Peshwari Naan  and not the kind sold in super marketsWe live in Newhaven and decided to give Ocean Spice a go  phoning in our order and explaining our situationThey were over the top helpful with the nut situation  including calling back and asking a few extra questions just to make sure If you have anyone with an allergy in your household you know this is very important  and we were very thankfulI had the Saag Panir and Peshwari Naan and my OH had a chicken dish Both were enjoyable and we would definitely order from them againA year or two ago i was gutted when the Indian Takeaway Paradise Cafe across the road from us closed down Not long after a new one opened Ocean Spice so we tried his one and love it The food is delicious If you like your curry more or less spicy just tell them and theyll adapt it for you Weve had a range of curries and they are always delicious You should also like their facebook page as they have just had a 20 off pomo on thereThe guy behind the desk is lovely always very chatty and friendly  I would recommend this takeaway in a heart beat In particular you must try their haggis pakora might sound a bit weird but im addicted :"

    "review":"This place just takes itself a little too seriouslyI like nice dcor and surroundings just as much as anyone else when I go to a restaurant but I really dont need to read about who designed itwhat fabric they used for itwhere this particular cushion was imported from in the menu By definition when I open the menu its because Im hungry and I want to eatAfter all their obsessive descriptions about every aspect of every single item that was within a mile radius of the restaurant I couldnt help but suspect that they were doing it to dazzle you so much that you wouldnt notice if the food was mediocre And it turned out I was right I have no doubt that the ingredients were all grown especially for them and probably flown in on a private jet or something equally ridiculous but there are so many other great food places along George IV bridge that I did feel a bit ripped offBeing part of the Hotel Missoni people will always eat here Mainly because of its reputation and because its the kind of place that you can namedrop But unfortunately the quality and style of Missoni clothes doesnt transfer to their hotel restaurantsEverything about Hotel Missoni is newly stylish immaculately finished and trimmed with an edge of slightly eccentric fun including Cucina the Italian restaurant that makes up part of the hotelThis is definitely a classy Italian dining experience where youre served by smooth Missoni clad waiters who are the kind of waiters that seem to glide along quietly doing their thing not interfering too much with your meal but making sure that everything is attended to nonethelessI had freshly made penne pasta with a pork ragu sauce which was fantastic and full of flavour followed by a good old glass vessel of Tiramisu very much on the coffee tasting side of things rather than the sweeter edge served up in some restaurants and really really good This restaurant gets a no hesitation recommendation from me although strangely for a Thursday night normally a fairly busy evening in town the restaurant seemed pretty quiet Probably just a one off because town didnt really seem that busy anyway on that particular evening and sometimes its better to have a bit of peace and quiet while you have some quality pasta and parmesan timeFood: We ordered three starters the octopus the caprese and the zucchini along with three entrees the lasagna the lamb and the ribeye steak  Everything was delicious especially the lasagne  For dessert we shared ice creamDrinks: We ordered one bottle of red wine Price: 10525 GBP for three people Ambiance: The restaurant is very nice and wasnt very crowded Service: It was fine and our waitress was friendly Would I go back  Yes its good food and convenient if youre staying in the hotelWe had a very nice evening there The Service was very good and the food excellent We went to three restaurants in Edinburgh during our visit and this one was the bestWent here for dinner and for afternoon tea Afternoon tea 4 stars: we booked the private room for a table of 12 The sandwiches were excellent and selection of Italian desserts very good It was served with a glass of Prosecco and strawberries Service was excellent A great private afternoon tea experience Dinner 2 stars: Average food The rabbit ragu was very salty Ive only been once and havent returned since  not a high priority on my listDont know how it survives except that its down about a block from the castle Was at castle and it was raining My husband and I left to find something hot to eat to warm up After checking out the menu out side the entry to cucina and it looked goodThere was Only one other couple  dining  it was lunch hour there was several employees standing around and a photographer taking photos of nice looking foodAnyway  we were not greeted at the door we had to approach  them It took over 5 minutes to just get a menu I asked for a glass of Pino Grigio  Italian restaurant and was told that they dont have Pino Grigio  by the glass  that they only have Italian wines The manager or maybe he was the owner was summoned by the waitress  He told me they only serve Pino Grigio  by the bottle But that he could recommend another wine  great recommendation  I liked the wine We realized most likely the service was going to continue to be bad and we didnt have all day so we decided to just get a quick bowl of soup and then go somewhere else We ordered 2 bowls of Minestrone soup and  my husband wanted hot tea and we asked to ice water we were asked if we wanted sparkling and we said no just flat regular waterNo kidding about 10 minutes later they came with water and bread  I asked about the tea which then took at least another 5 minutes  it took about another 20 minutes for our soup to get to the table  I dont know why it took so long because the soup seemed to be hot water with semi thawed frozen carrots  peas lots of diced onions celery and some kind of undercooked dried beans  My husband ate his and I couldnt eat mine  No one asked how it was We asked for the check and when we got it I explained that the soup was horrible  When our check came I couldnt believe the total bill was 38 pounds  They charged us for waterAnd speaking of water  Id swear the so called soup was just hot water with stuff thrown in  Glad we did not order a whole meal "

    "review":"The Scotsman hotel is in what was the Scotsman Newspaper building When I was a kid I remember getting a guided tour and I remember it being noisy and full of machinery The paper has long since relocated to the purpose built HQ in Holyrood Road The refit preserved many beautiful original features of the building like the wooden paneled reception room that is now the bar The stairwell is stunning all black and white tilesIt has a gym spa and stainless steel poolIve not stayed but Ive been here many times hosting training sessions Some of the function rooms have very low ceilings As the building was a renovated place of work it can be a rabbit warren and Ive lost a few delegates as they went to the toilet They serve coffee in mugs that have crosswords on them nice touchMy husband and I took our honeymoon tour of Ireland and Scotland back in August of 2013 When we were in Ireland preparing to depart for Edinburgh my husband was consulting his Scotland guidebook and mentioned to me the tradition of high tea It sounded excellent so I looked online for places that offered a gluten free option for afternoon tea The Scotsman had rave reviews and was the least expensive option so we decided to stop there on our first day in Edinburgh after a long day of touristy things Holyrood and the Castle We did not make a reservation but stopped in around 3:30 in the afternoonWe were very impressed with how classy everything seemed We were ushered into a quiet room with a few other groups scattered around at different tables It felt very sophisticated and was quite a fun experience I ordered the gluten free option and my husband went with the regular I had a pot of apple tea  it was pink when I added the cream When they brought the tray out it didnt seem like a lot of food The height was deceptive  its really a ton of food I started with the finger sandwiches and worked my way up the tray I liked most of the sandwiches although I did not like one of the fish sandwiches so I gave it to my husband The thing that really stood out for me was the scone Oh my God The scone To die for It was slightly smaller than my husbands glutenfilled counterpart but the texture was phenomenal I was recently gluten free at that point I smothered it with clotted cream and jelly and happily went to town on it Last but not least were the desserts I remember all of them being delicious although I seem to recall that the gluten free tray had one less dessert than the regular tray It didnt matter though We both left stuffed You could have rolled me out of there Our waiter came back when we were finished and seemed surprised that we finished our trays down to the last crumb He came across as somewhat haughty and a little judgmental but we didnt let that get in the way of our experience We do our best when traveling internationally to be normal quiet and respectful the opposite of the American stereotype some people have Anyway the point is definitely come here for tea if youre celiac or gluten intolerant or just gluten free by choice It is so worth it My husband loved his tea too so the regular must be just as good It is worth every penceGreat old school vibe with class They offer great three course lunch specials The salmon and heirloom salad were both greatIve never stayed at the Scotsman Hotel although I can imagine with it being a five star boutique hotel spending a few nights here would probably be delightful The main staircase in the Scotsman Hotel is something to behold as is the actual building itself which juts out into the Edinburgh landscape and is accessed from North Bridge The building is Victorian and with its turrets and stained glass windows is simply stunningDespite having not stayed overnight in the hotel I do have experience of drinking at the bar surprise surprise and having a few cocktails in what used to be the offices for the Scotsman newspaper has massive atmospheric appeal for me Coming to work here in the heyday of print journalism must have been absolutely awesome The North Bridge Brasserie and Bar where you can have yourself a classy and well concocted selection of cocktails and other beverages used to be the reception room for the newspaper and is equally as striking as the rest of the building Definitely recommended not least for the rich history and grand atmosphere of the venueWow My last review of this place was of my visit to the bar but when my parents styed in the hotel here for my graduation the whole thing was so amazing I have to write an updateThey were upgraded to a suite without even asking and for no apparent reason for starters And the cant do enough for their customers attitude was apparent in every aspect of the service especially the receptionist and concierge If someone asked me to recommend a premium hotel in Edinburgh Id definitely say this one over the likes of The BalmoralReally nice service Lovely hotell in central Edinborugh Grate view Excellent gym Nice staff"

    "review":"Cafe Rouge especially come the weekend is always bustling with diners Theres plenty of reasons to justify this observation: the classical French food is exceptional and the service is rapidIve repeatedly opted for their onion soup alongside the Gruyre cheese and caramelised onion Fougasse a light soft French bread Such simple French dishes are consistently produced to a gob smackingly tasty standard each and every time Ive dined here  I admire restaurants that dont overlook the classics and avoid serving the more complicated dishes Plus the prices are affordable and as a place to eat lunch its superbIt speaks volumes for a place by how busy it is and Cafe Rouge is always very busy You have to book  theres no question about that But its a brilliant placeTheir food is delicious I especially love their steak sandwiches they do a male and female version and their smoked salmon salad The only thing I would say is their coke is served in TINY glasses I had to ask for 3 topups The table comes with a jug of water though so its not a big problemThe service is brilliant too  when my cousin still hadnt arrived they took away his preordered steak and chips and kept it on heat for him providing fresh chips Its the little touches ehA gorgeous cafe on a busy street in New Town  A small patio outside to enjoy the weather and cute cafe tables on the inside  We had no wait even over the XmasNew years holiday at prime lunch hourExcellent service very tasty lunch fare and reasonable pricesI would definitely return here and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as wellConsidering this is part of a massive chain I was very pleasantly surprised when eating dinner here at the start of this week The chicken liver terrine came with an ample amount of bread the beef bourginon was very tasty and filling as well as cooked so that the meat practically melted at the touch of the fork and the tarte au citron was a fitting dessert seeing as I was too full to risk failing to finish the cheese board The service from our waitress Ruth  the rest of the staff was attentive  never intrusive so all in a very enjoyable experienceI tried escargot for the first time here and it was marvelous The duck confit is fantastic as well seriously the best Ive had in a while Lovely atmosphere and serviceBeef bourginon reminded me of airplane food Unfortunately on a Saturday night when every good restaurant in these few blocks is booked solid walking in here to a half empty dining room should be a clear sign Nice enough staff just truly tasteless food My cooked vegetables came with absolutely nothing on them not a hint of salt pepper oil butter ANYTHING Definitely instant mashed potatoes as well Beef broth was too salty and the meat was sparse and fatty Unacceptable for your signature dish at a French restaurant"

    "review":"I rarely venture into Princes Mall but one rainy day not so long ago I was waiting for a delayed train and was feeling more than just a little peckish I wandered around Princes Mall to get out off the rain and to see if I could find somewhere to satisfy my hunger it was then that I found Spud U Like a tasty baked potato with a huge choice of filling perfectI opted for beans and cheese and my spud hit the spot perfectly I devoured it in record time and if Im honest I could probably have eaten another one but it was time to go get my train They seem a pretty health conscious bunch and theres a chart to tell you how many calories is contained within your tattie but it wasnt really top of my list of priorities when my stomach was rumbling with hungerYou cant beat a baked potato and the tatties here are delishIm partial to a tater here and there so was quite happy to put up with the horrendous surroundings of Princes Mall in order to stuff my face with one It was the option of chilli con carne that did it a menu choice peculiarly unavailable at Tempting Tattie a few minutes up the roadWhen they piled on the cheese then the chilli I was quite literally foaming tthe mouth with anticipation and o the disappointment that followed was all the more heartbreaking The chilli was lukewarm meaning it didnt melt the cheese and both ingredients just tasted a little bit off Not horrendous enough for me to fail to polish off every last morsel but a letdown nonethelessIt was a little bit expensive too but I did enjoy my side order of garlic bread Passable but on this occasion not worth the misery of Princes MallSomewhat embarrassingly it was only in a review the other night that I stated my enthusiasm for giving Spud U Like a try Theres really no better feeling in the world than getting your comeuppanceThere are a lot of really good baked potato places throughout Edinburgh Unfortunatly SpudULike isnt one of themAside from having a name that grates on me so much it hurts its also located in the ghastly Princes Mall food court  which while I dont mind in a broad sense I would rather not spend a huge amount of time in The food itself is ab it below par  its not the best quality and not the best tastin nor the warmest food youll ever eat yuck cold beans on my jacket potato  but it is on the cheaper sideHowever when you take into account the best baked potato shop in the entire city is a five minute walk away at the top of Cockburn street even that last positive point pales into insignificanceWas waiting for a bus after getting off the train and with time to spare went into Princess Mall  Why do Brits have to give everything royal names  I hadnt been to a Spud U Like in many years so when I saw the one in the food court there I had to relive the old days of hanging out in Exeter and having a spud with tons of a topping on itThere were the two of us and I was boring and had the sour cream and chives while Sylvia had baked beans  I thought it strange that a Slovak would order baked beans or even know what baked beans were  Do they really bake them  I actually got Meal A which was the topped up tater and a drink  Well the drink was a soda but I wanted a coffee so had to pay 40 pence more  Both spuds were delicious  The service was fast and the young man working there was also very nice pleasant chatty  It was a fine distraction before the bus to the airport"

    "review":"Very average Chinese food at least by London standards The menu has quite an authentic selection of dishes Unfortunately the cooking quality was not the bestPricewise it was good value and the atmosphere inside is very conducive for a quiet dinner and for serious discussions over dinner Plus great locationThe London Insiderhttp:wwwlondoninsidercoukKind of gross The 2nd worst Chinese restaurant I have been to in my life first being Aunty Changs in Houston TX Lets just comment on the fact that the hot  sour soup is 510GBP per small bowl that is wildly ridiculous when you can sit down at a local pub for a full meal for that price We ordered Mabo Tofu  Yushan beef aka garlic beef sometimes which are very normal Chinese dishes  The Mabo tofu came out barely covering the bottom of the plate skimpy quantity tasting not like normalauthentic Mabo tofu but edible except for the bijillion poppy seeds in the dish that you would have to pick out  I am totally not exaggerating Then the yushan beef came out looking quite bland  We called the waiter over to make sure that is actually the right dish and he gave us the snobby this is what Westerner do  Its not like Yushan beef in China its a garlic sauce here  Excuse me  You cant even speak English  you are telling me an American what westerners expect in a Chinese dish  What a joke  Yes the dish is sometimes in some places called garlic beef but the cooking methods and sauces and tastes never alter  It is supposed to be a mildly sweet dish with shredded veggies and meat in brown sauce  In Golden Dragons case we had chunks of vegetable and meat in some weird sauce  no garlic to be found either  To make things worse they charge a 10 service charge  You are stuck with it whether you liked the foodservice or not What a rip offThe Golden Dragon has an east to find location right off of Rose street and unlike other Cantonese places in the city they do not require reservations The staff was friendly and the food was pretty good It was not the most amazing Chinese food I have ever had but for stumbling upon it on a cold Saturday night it was great I will probably try a new place before coming back but for a quick dinner give it a shotIf you are in the mood for a decent Chinese meal the Golden Dragon is the place to go Situated in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh the Golden Dragon in right in the centre of the city and is just a short walk from the main shopping street Princes Street and so it is a convenient place to reach The inside of the restaurant is very large and spacious with lots of tables and they are able to cater for large private parties and so it is worth enquiring about this The Golden Dragon offers an expansive menu filled with authentic Chinese dishes I came here for dinner for the first time several weeks ago and I had the most delicious tasting food I ordered the sesame prawn toast for my starter which was really tasty and the prawns were cooked perfectly and it wasnt greasy and oily like I have sometimes tasted it I then had the chili beef for my main course which was even better than the starter It was nice and spicy without being too hot that it blew my head off and ruined the meal There were so many flavours going on in the dish and all the ingredients lasted really fresh  absolutely yummy The egg fried rice was also amazingly cooked The Golden Dragons menu offers a good selection of vegetarian and seafood dishes and so there is bound to be something to suit everyone on the menu The staff were also super friendly and welcoming and were very patient with me when they explained exactly what each dish was on the menu The Golden Dragon is a fantastic Chinese restaurant in the heart of the city which is definitely worth a visitVery mediocre and overpriced for the quality of the food we were served  The duck soup was incredibly fatty and salty and hubbys chicken something was of a very generic flavor and texture  Reminded me of the Chinese leftovers you eat when you have nothing left in the fridge"

    "review":"After a staying a week in Edinburgh in Leith for business I ended up at a number of local restaurants with my clients  The Shore was by far the best dining atmosphere and friendly knowledgable service staff  Fantastic place and I would recommend to all  Just beautiful food parings and great local beer  whisky selectionThe Shore is a little haven of atmospheric bars and restaurants in Leith away from the centre of town and away from most of the places Ive already been to about a thousand times purely because I was feeling lazy and couldnt be bothered to walk the extra 20 minutes into Leith from the centre or jump on a 5 minute bus to come that tiny wee bit furtherThe Shore and the Water of Leith are really pretty both at night and especially during a beaming sunny day I think when you live in a busy city its always good to know you have that option of being by the sea and its nice just having a wander about here in between the chains of the pier and over the little bridge There is the consistently delicious Fishers restaurant to visit Malmaison The Ship and various other good looking bars and restaurants to pick from Ocean Terminal shopping centre is also just a quick stroll up the road if you fancy some shopping entertainmentHaving only just discovered the delights of Leith I am now about to do my first review of a place on the waterfrontFirstly I was attracted to this place first because of how full it was  odd reasoning you may thing but frannkly it was an excellent reason as the atmopshere here is great on balmy sunny evenings such as the evening we were hereThe staff were friendly and helpful especially at the bar which was so well stocked I couldnt believe it  they even had my favourate drink which I always struggle to get anywhereThe restaurant itself was sublime the menu is mostly fish based but there are a few other options However the fish that is served here is deleiciuos so I strongly recommend eating here as often as you can to try all the menuWhat a lovely place Its in a great location and has lovely views of Leith and the canal   A few of my mums friends have told me to come to this place for yelp and Im annoyed it took  me so long to come here Its got a great reputation amongst locals which is always a sign of a good restaurantThe staff are lovely they really want you to have a good time and they are at your beck and callThe atmosphere is cosy really pleasant and what youd expect from  a busy restaurant The food is lovely too everything is mouth watering and reasonableAll in all a wonderful experiencePerfectNot much of a review but more is not needed It is to the point and accurate But for those of you who want a story you can continue reading although all the text following from this point forward will just continue to point to that one word reviewMy girlfriend and I were visiting Edinburgh on vacation and we wanted an especially good dinner for our final night The owner of the BB we were staying with suggested we go to Leith For me that was a shock as during my last trip to Edinburgh in 2002 there was no reason to think that was the place for great cuisine But for my girlfriend she was not at all surprised a professor at the University of Manchester she knew had suggested the same city for exquisite dining as that was where he and his wife always went to for great cuisine when in ScotlandSo on a rare clear Friday night we took the bus out to the waterfront of Leith hopped out where the restaurants seemed to be and searched We quickly found a little street near the water which had nothing but seafood restaurants All of them but the Shore were fully booked we only got in at the Shore thanks to a cancellation The staff was very friendly and tried their best to accomodate us tourists who were trying to sneak in a nice meal on their tripAfter wandering the local area waiting for out seating time we sat down and perused the menu My girlfriend was recommended a local mixed drink while I stuck with water as usual We ordered ham hash cakes as a starter For a main I went with haddock and chipsThe drink came and my girlfriend was instantly in heaven The standard had been set The appetizer came and it continued to hold the standard highI then got my main course Admittedly I am not a fish person at all but being at a seafood restaurant off the water I went with the fish I am very glad I did It was a simple dish but it was perfectly prepared I devoured as much of it as possible until I was so full I literally could not go beyond a single bite of my girlfriends dessert If you knew me you would know that me praising any fish dish is a big dealAfter sitting there for a short while enjoying the simple atmosphere and our meal we left pleased that such a fine dining experience did not decimate our pocketbooksReflecting on this meal my girlfriend and I still remember how much we enjoyed it She has called it the best meal she has ever had and I would tend to agree with her although I have a soft spot for my various meals at FuelAs I said my review comes down to a single word: perfectFood drinks service everything TOP DOLLAR AMAZING again Can say no more Best place in Edinburgh"

    "review":"What an experience We were recommended to Seasons from our Concierge at the Apex Waterloo Hotel We were absolutely amazed The food was spectacular scrumptious and exciting We didnt know what to expect because youre given a list of ingredients and asked if you dislike any or have any allergies We only had one issue We chose the drink pairings and the 5 course which turned out to be 6 course if you count the apple sorbet palette cleanser Service was outstanding Location great I seriously cant say enough good things Price was reasonable given the quality Roughly 55poundsperson So worth itLovely resto for special occasions or something a little but different from the ordinary We started the evening with a pre dinner drink in the basement speakeasy bar The Stewarts Hollyrood Pale Ale on draft was light  refreshing and the Earl Gray Collins had a lovely kick to it The bar seemed a bit stark  was a bit on the chilly side More pictures  heat would add to the ambienceatmosphere Upstairs in the restaurant the staff were attentive despite being busy Each course was explained in detail We went for the 7 course tasting menu with paired drinks The stand out dishes of the night were the wild boar terrine  the hake which melted in the mouth The nettle soup had an interesting flavour The lamb dish was good but not quite as tender as it could have been The desserts were good but not particularly innovative compared to the savoury courses The winesdrinks pairing was well executed The blended wines worked well with each course and the cocktail was a nice addition Id definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking something a little different for a special occasionEdinburgh is slowly becoming a true gastronomic gem with a huge number an variety of top class restaurants and bars opening alongside classic favourites It really warms my foodie heart : my latest restaurant was to Seasons after reading a review of it on a favourite blog I made the booking and soon we were off for a evening full of simple but tasty culinary delightsThe whole menu of ingredients is becoming quite the thing in Edinburgh I love the idea and Ive seen it work really well but also completely fail  So with fingers cross I hope that Seasons would be the first not the latter  Thankfully I was right with a 7 course tasting menu that was delivered to high skill with really quality ingredients To summarise the evening we had: celeriac volute with leekssmoked salmon with pickled cucumbers cloudberry sorbet crisp bread and dillwild boar terrine with apple sauce wild garlic blue carrot and baby parsnip wild nettle soup with croutons and sweet viola hake with scandi seasoned lentils cauliflower pure crispy seaweed and Spring beauty venison with asparagus purple potato croquette wild mushroom and red wine jus rose apple pastry with vanilla ice cream crumble apple jelly as cinnamonAnd all that with a quince sidecar cocktail chestnut bourbon cocktail and two glasses of red wine It was classic ingredients done exceptionally well in really tasty and slightly different ways I enjoyed every course but the stand out for me was the nettle soup and the venison With the food being the real star the restaurant was done out in neutral shades with pine walls and clean lines  Its not a massive place with two smaller dining rooms but I felt it really worked for good ambience and experience I felt the only let down was the service When we arrived the restaurant was fairly quiet and service was spot on  When it started to get busy a while later the service did slip a bit which was a shame but I think something easily fixed  However the service we did receive was friendly helpful and polite The 5 and 7 course menus are reasonably priced for what is served However its probably not a place youd just go on a whim more of a special date night or celebration restaurant That said though Ill definitely find another excuse to go back soon and see what the next list of ingredients brings"

    "review":"Love this place Never fails to rid me of the dreaded hangover The Pizzas here are simply put as delicious although Ive never tried anything else on the menu Thats why you go to Pizza Hut Well you go because you want pizza right You totally have to try the Veg Hot One With stuffed cheese crust Too die for I Always order the platter as a litebite starter which consists of 4 breaded chicken a mound of skinned potato wedges with a garnish of parsley 4 garlic and cheese bruschettas two dipping sauces of your choice My personal favourite being Chilli BBQ Just because I love the sauces that muchI remove them from my plate so there not taken by the waiting staff Use it for sauce when your pizza arrives As for the staff theyre very upbeat and very friendly Even though they are rushed off their feet as it can sometimes get a little busy in the afternoons As a touch they speak to you after your food just simply small talk but I guess they treat you like a human not just a contribution to a pay check at the end of the monthI havent visited Pizza Hut in years but today we had a hangover emergency with the SR so popped in while shopping at Kinnaird Park It wasnt a great experience but almost the opposite of pizza establishments irrespective of being higher end independent or another chain This particular restaurant was absolutely heaving on a chilly Sunday November afternoon Our poor waitress looked like she was on the brink of a breakdown and looking forward to her break I dont blame her We went for a massive pizza splurge and I had the veggiehot veggie half n half while the SR had the BBQ AmericanoCajun Sizzler My veggie was missing spinach entirely and there was only a suggestion of a tomato sauce on the base Oddly despite there being a strong presence of the other vegetables peppers mushroom etc the pizza mainly tasted of slighly undercooked pizza base The SR commented that his was the same Its strange really as I usually find pizzas tend to be stinting on toppings that here although the toppings were generous overall they were disappointing and I think it was a combination of barely cooked pizza perhaps the ovens were overworked due to the high turnover of people and stingy amount of tomato sauce dressing Service wise was not bad given how busy it was and we were tucked firmly in the furthest corner by the disabled toilets and the ice cream machine our waitiress was doing her best Cleanliness was a little suspect  after having to return two dirty cups and questioned as to whether I was confusing tea stains for food stains but tea stains dont leave congealed lumps at least not the brands I use I dont think Ill bother returning to a Pizza Hut again in the future"

    "review":"On the downside I booked their private dining area for a group and when we arrived they didnt give us it Instead they spread our group across two separated tables which completely spoiled the evening On the plus side the food was awesome Best steak Ive ever tasted Id skip it though and go somewhere less pretentious there are lots of alternatives in Edinburgh after allWe were looking for a place to have a cigar and fine scotch and found it at Tigerlily A lively quaint  well appointed restaurant and bar we whole heartedly endorseWe stayed at the hotel for a Saturday night in July arrived around 1:20pm while checkin time is 2pm to a snobby receptionistThe receptionist promised to give us a call when the room was ready so we walked around George St Princes St spent some time in a park before we headed back to the hotel around 2:40pm this time served by another snobby receptionist and still had to wait until after 3pm From the other reviews this seems like some kind of systematic problemThe room was absolutely beautiful and clean a big separate bathroom very comfortable beds amazing furnitureWe spent the night in a closeby venue watching a great local band and returned to the hotel around 12:30am The hotel entrance and the bar were completely packed the music was exceptionally loud and the elevator was blocked by round about a dozen drunken guys trying to party inside the 4prselevator cab So we had to find the stairs up to our roomIn the room it was way too loud to think of sleeping it felt like the loud bass made the bed swing There were people walking around the corridor doors clapping every now and then and even some people trying to open our door After the music stopped between 3am and 3:30am there was still lots of noise coming in from the corridor The receptionist on checkout next morning was friendlier than the two guys during checkinTigerlily was hyped up so much by friends and family that it seemed a place not to miss in Edinburgh This is true I understand the hype The venue itself is pretty gorgeous and on a Saturday night it was absolutely packed I was blown away by the  size of the cocktail menu It is huge Thirty six pages some are photographs of amazing cocktails However the cocktails I chose was disappointing I went for my usual Bloody Mary which is made with Belvedere Bloody Mary Vodka and Absolut Peppar vodka Sounds amazing right It was pretty diluted with the vodka so that the punch of the flavours just wasnt there It was very bland and boring It didnt work for me so thats why I took a star off my rating Other than that its a great place for a night out in EdinburghMy husband and I first recognized Tigerlily because it was conveniently located outside our window at the hotel Roxburghe After dinner with some friends at a different establishment a friend who was familiar with Edinburgh suggested Tigerlily I was extremely tired because I had flown in from the US that morning and had remembered that it was across the street from our hotelso I agreed to go for a drink or two knowing I could leave when I wanted and just hop across the street and go to bed It was a Thursday night about 12:30I guess they close at 1 so they warned us at the door and told us we were welcome to come in and then continue our fun late late night at their sister nightclub downstairs Lulu We came in and had a few drinks at the front bar The service was attentive yet the drinks were considerably weak I guess you just have to ask for doubles Even though a half hour into our stay we were having so much fun that we decided to go downstairs and completely had forgotten about our jetlag Oh and Tigerlilys decor is super modern and trendy definitely one of the coolest places I have been in awhile When we arrived downstairs we were sat at a corner table with some friends who were celebrating getting married that weekend We had a blast Our server even in this crazy nightclub was attentive but gave us enough space and she came over when we needed something The Dj was great and open to suggestions and actually played them That was our FIRST visit to Tigerlily and LuluWe had so much fun that Thursday we decided to bring different friends in on Friday We were all staying at the Roxburghe like I said before so it was easy to get people to decide to go On this visit we ventured to the bar in the back of the restaurant This place on a Friday in July was PACKED It was awesome Lots of people my age midtwenties to midthirties having cocktails with friends and family and most very goodlooking Everyone seemed to be having a good time The bartenders in the back bar were great well the guys They always remembered what my husband and I were drinking and even though they were busy they were still very attentive Also after one round we opened a tab they give you this number so you can tell them your tab number instead of your name very cool and the bartenders remembered my tab number AWESOME They only thing I noticed was the female bartender very pretty but she was either new to the establishment or a new bartender altogether because it took this poor girl seriously 10 minutes to open a bottle of wine for a customer at the bar and then another 10 minutes to give them a check probably 30 minutes in customer years Im a bar owner in the US I think it would have impacted my experience had I been waiting for a drink like a lot of other people but because of the male bartenders I was taken care of already I know tipping isnt customary in the UK but I felt like my service was so excellent that I had to So to recap Great decor great service at both Lulu and Tigerlily good drinks The only thing that was missing was that I never tried the food Maybe next time Im in Edinburgh :The food is not the reason to go The place is glam and it predominately used for Essex lookalikes"

    "review":"TERRIBLE AND RUDE SERVICEThe star rating on Qype and Google are deceiving as most of the ratings are over three years old and this establishment has had a change of management for the worseWe stopped off here after a day of exploring and tasting much that Edinburgh has to offer  The front of the restaurant has smaller tables which looked like a nice area to get drinks and appetizers while there is a full restaurant in the lower level  We sat down and informed the waiter that we were just interested in wine and a light bite and would not be ordering a full dinner  He literally sulked and told us we must order a full meal  We thought he was joking and informed him we would love to try a full meal another night but that we were not hungry enough right now  He then asked us to leave  Seriously  At this point it became obvious he was not joking and so we left  How is the food  No idea as we could not get past Cerberus the waiter from the underworld but while we were waiting we were given prepackaged italian breadsticks  A good restaurant would provide fresh bread IMHOThere are much better choices in the areaThe Patio Restaurant is definitely not the best restaurant in Edinburgh It doesnt look much on the outside and to be honest it is isnt up to much inside either Situated in Hanover Street The Patio Restaurant is in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and so it should be hot spot for people going for lunch and dinner but its not  because it is awfulThe inside of The Patio Restaurant is really drab and dull and could definitely do with a revamp I came here for lunch one day and I was really disappointed with my whole experience This is an Italian restaurant serving pizzas and pastas but not that well I ordered a peperoni pizza which hardly had any topping or cheese and it was literally dripping in grease  it is something which I would only normally eat on my way home for a night out not for a nice lunch The prices were very reasonable here though with most main courses costing under six pounds The staff were friendly enough and the portion sizes were fairly decent There are much better Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of your custom"

    "review":"Yet another place that Ive meant to go to for a while and have only now managed Wandered in on Friday afternoon last week with a couple of friends and we were I suppose lucky to get a table straight away as the place was heaving Once seated the number of other customers revealed the first downside to the cafe  its acoustics Either this was an unusually loud collection of customers or anything over half full always results in such a cacophony but it was noticeable for the entire time we were in there and as such offputting Waiting time service quality of food eggs florentine beef olive and lamb shank and prices the pot of tea was particularly good value for money were all fine but Ill think twice about going back in if the number of punters is that high next timeVery busy breakfastbrunch place out Granton way   We have gone here a couple of times and the food is ok but not as good as our favourite haunt  It does have more sweet options from what I recall  I got French Toast with maple strip other first time and this time we both got the full breakfast mine vegetarian optionIf you ever find yourself down at Newhaven perhaps not all that likely unless you live there take the time to pay a visit to Porto and Fi This wonderful little deli and cafe is the perfect place to have a bite to eat and a cup of tea When I worked along the road in Granton my workmate and I used to treat ourselves to lunch here occasionally  treat being the operative word The food here is excellent they try to locally source as many ingredients as possible and this hard work pays off even a simple sandwich is delicious I am a big fan of their cakes and this was the first place to introduce me to the delights of chocolate beetroot cake I know it sounds like a pretty eccentric combination but the main ingredients really compliment each other: the chocolate is rich and sweet and the beetroot keeps the sponge moist It can get pretty busy the Newhaven locals have really bought into this place so it can mean a bit of a wait for a table do wait though  its worth itThis will be a short review right to the point  I bought two brownies to go and was charged 830 for the pleasure Actually I was originally asked for 770 until the girl claimed the price has gone up a few days ago and shes forgotten I was equally not impressed and shocked to silence at the cost of two brownies and with her rather rude attitude when I questioned the price Ive bought more intricate cupcakes from other bakeries around town and been charged half the price I was asked for these brownies so needless to say I was less than impressed  The brownies were quite tasty but for over 4 each they were not that tasty This place is stupidly overpriced and I will not be heading backI need to declare up front Im an Eggs Benedict fan Some people arent and thats cool but if you even remotely partake every now and thenget down to Porto  Fi and experience what is possibly the best hollandaise youll ever have MagicVery friendly table service and a great seaside setting make this a place to come as a family group or singlenot to mention the fab cake offerings and daily specialsYou may wonder why only a 4 star review given the massive compliment above Well the coffee was ok but SOOOOOO hot I had to wait 10 mins before I could get my lips to it As I have been advised most recently thanks Artisan Coffee it should be served between 60  62 degreesnot 162We had a lovely lunch at Porto  Fi The soup was exceptionally good  really first classOverall we said: Porto  Fi was really good Ill gladly be back to sample some of the other treats from their menu Id heartily recommend you pay it a visit but remember to book"

    "review":"I tend to be suspicious of trendy places but the burger here was great A strong 4 stars with good meat and bun but I wish I tasted more cheese than picklesWill probably come back to try the DIY burger on the evening menuTanya a friend and an elite had a voucher for this place and so I went along with her and we had some nachos and burgers There seems to be this huge trend across the country for burgers and more american style dishes but this one just didnt make a mark for me The nachos had big chunks of chicken that were not spread out well and not enough salsa or guac to share The burger wasnt bad but if it wasnt for the voucher I do not think I would go backThe service was fantastic and the waitress was really friendly and helpful with her recommendations Its a real shame at the time they did not have an alcohol licence so we couldnt wash down the burger but the overall theme and vibe seemed a bit done and did not feel fresh enough for meVisited here at the weekend with my girlfriend  Seating arrangements were not the best  we felt like we had been sat a table that had just been separated from another table and could practically hear the other couple beside us conversation  We were going to ask if we could move as there was spare seats  but we never bothered We had a groupon voucher and I ordered a hot dog and my girlfriend got a burger food arrived quickly and I was happy with the food and portion size and so was my girlfriend We both decided to order desserts  My dessert arrived with no spoon  Also we never got any napkins for our desserts I would visit again but think a a couple of things can be improved uponWe were seated downstairs which is not ideal but not awful either There were 8 of us and we all had different dishes My main complaints were that even though the restaurant does not yet have its liquor license they also did not have tomato juice for a Virgin Bloody Mary They also were out of the ingredients for the peach smoothie but that might be because they have just opened and have not worked out the inventory yet The eggs Royale were tasty but the truffle fries were very skinny with some I melted cheese thrown on top Also my boyfriend had The Brooklyn which is WAY overpriced  We may go back after the restaurant has been open a little longerIm willing to give TriBeCa another erm try I came here with friends for a birthday brunch and had a good time but that was more to do with the company than the eatery Food took a really long time to come but once it did arrive it was a good feed I ordered the full breakfast which covered pretty much all the breakfast bases and was tasty I didnt like the tea very much cant place a finger on it but it just wasnt that great The service was ok like I say we had to wait a long time until the food arrived Waitress was pleasant and helped us back upstairs with my friends baby and buggy so definitely a thumbs up for helping out with that Budgetwise its not too expensive but hardly a bargain I think my breakfast was just shy of a tenner Add in tea and it was around the 12 mark Atmosphere was lively and as they dont book tables you kind of just have to wait at the front door until they get you a spot So if its a busy weekend morning expect to waitNice restaurant with a special 50 discount for student on Tuesday night Food is great It comes in a big portion Value for money Will definitely come back"

    "review":"Taste of China is the closest Chinese to my old flat in Bruntsfield and is located on Gilmore Place not far from the junction with Viewforth  Ive never really noticed it before as a Chinese but with moving flat I needed somewhere close for food and so we gave this place a tryThe food was alright for what I was looking for  just some food to satisfy hunger  The other people that ate it with me were not raving about it as we  it was just a fairly unremarkable takeaway experience  Certainly compared to other Chinese takeaways Ive had in the city it wasnt the bestIn terms of customer service and friendliness of the staff I cant really comment as I wasnt the one that bought the food  But for a basic meal it did the jobHad to wait an hour and a half from the expected delivery time for my order to actually arrive I called twice and the first time the woman apologised as they were very busy but that the delivery man had just left  but this obviously wasnt true as it doesnt take more than half an hour to get to my flat from Gilmore Place which is how long it tookI called again and she told me that the delivery guy had been calling and knocking on the door  he definitely hadnt However five minutes later I finally got a call from him looking for the flat The food was cold and so mediocre at best Customer service clearly isnt of importance for Taste of China  I understand it taking a little over the expected delivery time but an hour and a half is ridiculous Super disappointed seeing as this place has the best reviews on justeat Definitely will not be ordering from here againOnce upon a time this was a chip shop and the layout hasnt changed much since those days however how a place looks has very little bearing when the only service is takeaway As a takeaway Taste of China is big on portions and low on price normally this would imply a lack of quality but so far from the dishes I have tried this has not been the caseThey cook up the food quickly rarely more than 15 mins and they are certainly popular between walkins collections delivery drivers the phone and the just eat machine going off the staff on the counter rarely had a free moment For me this is a good sign that Taste of China is doing something rightSure if Im honest I have had better Chinese food in Edinburgh and sure it is fairly generic Chinese takeaway but it is fast cheap tasty and filling What more can you ask from a takeawayGood portions of very tasty food Ive never had any issues with this takeaway They deliver cheap and fast My favourites are:King prawn salt and pepperKing prawn honey and chilliKing prawn fried riceSalt and pepper chipsVegetarian spring rollsEverything is always hot and cooked good It is just a generic Chinese takeaway but its the best one I know of  in EdinburghIf your looking for a Cosy night in with a takeaway or a hangover cure this is your place The food comes in plastic reuseable boxes witch is handy for food storage I am a loyal customer of taste of chinaMan I dont like giving such critical reviews but this place just wasnt very friendlyThe glass outside says 5 lunch special Nope We walked in and asked and the man just pointed at the menu The decorations were lovely but the food was very expensiveI grew up eating Chinese food and I even ordered in Mandarin I asked the guy and hes from Beijing an areas food Im familiar with This wasnt even close Perhaps they were catering to tourists but if so the prices were too high Its a trade offcater to tourists and be cheap or cater to authenticity and stay expensiveThe dishes also didnt come with rice Whaaat Very sad If youre a poor student like me and my friends dont come here Maybe if you have money and want to pretend to eat fancy Chinese food you can come But to me its a rip off Sorry"

    "review":"Im a huge fan of Valvona  Crolla I went to their flagship store on Elm Row and had lunch opposite Clarissa Dixon Wright one of the two fat ladies and it was incredible The lunch not sitting opposite her you understand That was just a bit strange So I was expecting big things when I went to this place How disappointed I was We went inside to order coffees and the waiter was really short with us: Sit outside and I will come to you Erm OK He never came We sat there for 20 minutes and eventually we just leftIt was really busy that day so I thought Id give it another shot on a less busy day The service was just as bad and the coffee was rubbish And too expensive Im never going again Stick to the real deal or go somewhere elseThis is a real foodie sort of place in Edinburgh They often have live music in the upstairs restaurant and always has a great atmosphere  but I suggest you book it if you want a mealIts lovely to sit outside Valvona  Crolla on a nice day or even on any odd day The seats here are always scarce and always looks inviting to see people sitting out here on Edinburghs fanciest streetI often come here to drink Bellinis with friends  although I must admit they arent the best In a place like this youre paying to be seenYou can tell the food is good qualitybut its wasted on lil ole me I am not particularly fussy when it comes to food but they serve French truffles and parfait of goat  give me a maccy ds anydayVinn cafe seems to have it all: Good coffee excellent service and an interesting interior filled with all the stuff I want to buy to kit out my kitchen of the future Its located on Multrees walk the more upmarket shops are located here so people watching can be quite amusing The cafe has an open glass front so even if its chilli and the sun is out you can still enjoy the sun Because its part of the Vavona Crolla chain it also has a whole load of cool stuff for coffee and pasta making a bit over priced of course but good qualityVin Caffe is a great shopping stop off for really good coffee and a quick bite to eat If youre looking for something more substantial for lunch or dinner Vin Caffe also has a restaurant upstairs which serves some very yummy Italian food concoctionsThe cafe area inside is modern but traditionally Italian at the same time so theres a really good homely feel about sitting here with delightful coffee scents in the air and a selection of paninis and tasty looking cakes on offer There are also lots of seats at the counter so you can prop up the bar with your espresso Italian styleThe restaurant upstairs is classy looking and always busy with a mix of people so theres a really bustling atmosphere while youre dining The bread served here is amazing as its baked in the restaurants own bakery and the menu is made up of really fresh quality ingredients which after several samplings I can confirm taste awesome For a starter I favour the Antipasto followed by Pollo Saltimbocca a panfried chicken breast with proscuitto and sage served with roasted potatoesDo yourself a favour and try their cafe latte with the Tiramisu Ive only had this once and I hope the quality is always the same but Id definitely return to have more Dont try their macarons  dry and crunchy not worth itThe Valvona and Crolla Vin Caffe is a stylish shopcaferestaurant on Edinburghs exclusive Multrees Walk The Vin Caffe is split over two levels with the shopcafe on the ground floor and the restaurant above They also have a number of tables and chairs outside on Multrees Walk which are perfect for enjoying an afternoon coffee when the Scottish weather permits  its a pretty continental setup Valvona and Crolla is one of Edinburghs oldest and most prestigious Italian delicatessens and the Vin Caffe certainly lives up to the delis well established good reputation The coffee is exquisitely made and the tapasstyle nibbly dishes are of exceptional quality When I lived just around the corner I would occasionally come here for a bite to eat on a Sunday afternoon they do brilliant sausage rolls however the place is usually packed and it can be a bit of a mission to secure a seatIf someone else is picking up the bill get them to take you here  otherwise keep an eye on the website as they do some good value deals eg two small dishes and a glass of wine for 999"

    "review":"Efficient and fast good rolling machine expensive but with the coupons you can get an OK deal and you can actually combine them Like 2 for 1 AND free coke and garlic bread I personally love the cheese and bbq sauce crust yum Bit of a heavy door to be opening holding a stack of pizzas quite the challengeupdate: did get a wrong order once just wrong crust filling no biggie it happens but I did report it online and was expecting to hear something back but didntIt may seem somewhat lacklustre to review a single chain of Dominos but I feel theres enough to say to justify it Bear in mind then that the four stars here go for the quality of staff and service at this particular branch and do not necessarily reflect my opinion of the chain of restaurants as a whole If you dont already like Dominos then this outlet isnt going to change your mindI know Im certainly not alone in my love for a dirty takeaway pizza every now and then and I have to say that this Dominos really hits the spot The orders are always cooked and ready on time and the staff generally know what theyre doing A good rule of thumb as to the quality of oftfrequented chains is how often theyve gotten your order wrong Weve all experienced it you ask for no mushrooms and somehow end up with the shiitake special  but never once here has my order been anything but exactly what I specifiedIm not all too sure if this is a staple across all the Domino chain but you can get  a large pizza with any two toppings for 8 here and whilst that may be more expensive than the greasy takeaway a couple of doors down its easily enough to feed two people and it tastes pretty good tooTheres always a steady stream of staff flooding in and out of the doors into cars delivering takeaways so theyre obviously pleasing some customersWhilst I certainly see the merit behind the argument that big chains kill competition blah blah blah I feel happy in this case that I know theres a relatively cheap option close by for when I want to have a few mates round and get the pizzas inAnd they do 241 on Tuesdays on all pizzas  which is nice"

    "review":"This is another restaurant my lovely Grandmother has treated me to lunch atThe location on George Street is the first indication it will be a little expensive But unlike a lot of the overly trendy bars and restaurants on George Street Browns is actually worth it The decor is charming its very light and charming The staff are attentive and well trained The menu ranges from salads to steaks but most dishes are very interesting and the descriptions make your mouth water It took us both a long time to decide I went for the Chargrilled Chicken Salad  which was complimented nicely with pear and pine nuts It was fresh and delicious There is also a great cocktail menu but we didnt try anyI would probably return here on a special occasion as it is quite expensive However there is usually some great deals available from their websiteIf theres one thing I can say about Browns it is this  reliable It was one of the few places on George Street that didnt take reservations although it has just started to so you can walk in whenever you like and get a table I recently came here after a long drive at 930pm thinking the kitchen would be closed as it was a Tuesday night but I was greeted with great enthusiasm and invited to look at the menu within minutes of arriving I asked for the fish of the day  a fish pie which was delicious I was even given a poached egg following a conversation with the waiter  its the small things The fish pie came with tempura prawns as the chef decided he wanted to play around with the dish which I lovedTheir cocktails are really nice too a bit pricey but good Their menu is really extensive and they do a brilliant brunch which I highly recommend Again there can only be one word for Browns  reliableThis restaurant is located in the more upmarket area of Edinburgh and at lunch time primarily has business clientele My uncle took me here on his recent visit up to Edinburgh The food is very good their dishes are mostly Mediterranean inspired I really liked their risotto I had but the waiter said that they seasonally change their menu Its very large inside but I would recommend booking a table for a Fridayweekend night and is more for a fancy occasion rather than a quick bite It certainly is a highlight in George Street diningI have only been here fleetingly on a lunch time so I have to say my knowledge of Browns is limited to a 15 hour period around lunchtime and not the night time dining Browns also doesIm pleased to say that Browns was excellent  its food seemed to be very medditeranian influenced although there were a few suprises on the menu that I though might have been a bit out of place The drinks were well priced but I did get the impression that the food was a little expensive but I didnt expect it to be cheap saying as we were on George StreetBrowns itself is modern clean and crisp  with a nice atmosphere and friendl staffWe had dinner with the ladies as Randy called them or ya yas as they called themselves  I had spent the day with them after seeing the Castle and had a wonderful time picking out gifts for everyone  We ended up here and Randy met us  I had the burger which I inhaled and a Sazerac  most places dont know how to make that drink   I had introduced the ladies to the benefits of hard apple cider at a pub earlier on Rose St and many of them had cider with their burgers   We had excellent service and we got to eat outside Ina covered tent next to the most fragrant Rosemary plant   It was a great dinner with great company and I think I love love ScotlandGreat lobster tagliatelle and they have an offer on cocktails: Cosmo and berry martini are great at 5 only Really good location on George street too"

    "review":"Been wanting to come here since the place opened and finally got organised this weekend The restaurant looked a bit tightly packed with tables but once seated there seemed to be plenty of space Modern Asian decorations with some interesting touches here and there Nothing too out there and it did manage to conjure up a comfortable feeling to the place The service was great from the minute we got in through to getting the bill The menu is extensive with some really interesting bits and bobs I havent seen elsewhere The waiter discussed the specials with us and the orders were in Papadam and dips were a highlight nothing too exciting about the dips but the pickle was different to any others I have tried It seemed like it was homemade rather than from a jar Thumbs up from me We ordered 4 Papadams and it looked more like 6 or 7 we were given :DThe starters were met with mixed options the chicken and squid tanjores were excellent as were the accompanying salads The Rasa Vadai seemed a little strange we hadnt had Vadai before but it didnt leave an experience that we wanted to repeat in a hurry The Rasam it was severed in was lovely though Just in case you havent tried it Rasam is Indian tomato soup and well worth a try The mains were mixed and I forget what my dinner companions ordered but everything was excellent Both veggies and carnivores alike loved there choices I went for the special of the day which was rice with a mangotamarind fish curry with Idli on the side Lidls were new to me and were steamed rice and lentil cakes They didnt really taste of much but they did go well with the curry The curry had lots of fish but the tamarind was overpowering everything leaving the dish tasting a little bitter It was really nice just not greatI will be heading back to try some more of the menu as I think the special didnt really work for me but my companions loved their curries If the fish curry had been a little more mango and a little less tamarind this would be a 5 star review as all the other dishes were amazingThis place is fantastic   I was not expecting to find delicious Indian fooda BYO at that while on vacation in Scotland but Im so happy we did  The food was delicious and unlike any other Indian food Ive had in the states as we  mostly have northern Indian cuisine  I love the intricate use of spices and coconut milk as opposed to heavy creams as is common with northern Indian cuisine  The prices were very reasonable and the service was absolutely lovely  If this place were near me in the states Id be bringing all my friends thereI enjoyed a nice dinner here with my flatmates one of whom is an Indian who is very particular about their food Upon suggestion by my Indian flatmate I ordered the lamb dosai which was quite good I did order the food with extra potatoes again at my flatmates suggestion and instead the dosai came out with NO potatoes whatsoever which was disappointing to me Actually we all ordered extra potatoes and mine and as well as my other nonIndian flatmates meal came out with no potatoes instead We let it slide though as the dosai was still good but I did wonder if our server was paying attention at all The food took a while to arrive and our Indian flatmates food took even longer than ours to arrive  Anyway the three of us really did enjoy our meals despite not getting the potatoes we asked for We also ordered dessert and those were all good as well no complaints there However the service at Tanjore was truly nothing to write home about in all honesty which dampened our experience there  Would I come back Hmmm I honestly dont think so The food was good but I think the service overall was not great and the experience was average to me A plus about Tanjore is that the food is still cheap which a good thing Indian food in Edinburgh still seems to always be priced reasonably which is interesting to meNice curry and great parotta My friend ordered Tanjore lamb curry which was quite spicy but tasty I had Ambur lamb curry that didnt show on the menu but on the blackboard and it was good and merely spicy I didnt try the coconut rice chose but we all agree the parotta like a nann bread but more crispy on the surface goes well with any kind of curry Price is acceptableFor a fairly impromptu midprice meal in honour of my friends new flat and job Tanjore did the trick nicely The clean and compact interior feels welcoming enough and fuses East and West nicely with elephant embroidery on the ceiling around a classic chandelierWe both boggled at the sheer range on offer within the menus numerous pages  which include an entire page devoted solely to vegetarian starters  before eventually selecting our meals She plumped for Chennai fish curry with mint rice and I decided on Chicken Tanjore with lemon riceWe were both happy with the delicate balance of flavours in our curries and my friends mint rice was pretty special too The sweetness of the parotta was also a great accompaniment to the spicy flavours of the other foodThe service though was a little laboured and perfunctory from most quarters we had three different waiters over the course of the evening a special mention goes out to the young chap who served us last though with a smile that lit the room I was waiting for my friend to arrive for a good ten minutes and was not asked if I wanted a drink Similarly nobody checked on us during our meal to see if everything was okOur bill came to just under 35 which is really rather good for what we got but I cant help feeling that the experience would have left a warmer glow in my memory if the staff had been a little more attentive and personable I wouldnt object to another trip here but its not somewhere Id specifically recommendEverything about this place makes me want to go back for another meal I am originally from South India and found this restaurant during my recent trip to Edinburgh and immediately went in after looking at their menu I had the Mysore Masala Dosa which is hands down the best Ive had outside of India I also had filter coffee with my meal which was pretty good as well The best way to judge if I really liked an Indian restaurant abroad is asking myself if I would visit this place if it were in India I think with Tanjore the answer to that is a resounding yes"

    "review":"Kimmys is a good wee greasy spoon takeaway selling everything from breakfast rolls to quick fix lunchesIts fairly small but thats ideal if youre just passing through You cant fail to spot the colourful special offer stars spotted all over the window and its homely cosy exterior gives you an idea of what youre going to get  friendly efficient service and something to heat you upIts no frills comfort food at its best and refreshingly free of shockingly pretentious prices Uptown they place a 2 tax on a bacon roll based on the surroundings Its nice to visit somewhere that offers seriously affordable and perfectly decent food Perfect for some stodgy warmth on a cold dull dayI could live in a place like this constantly having my teacup filled up and bacon rolls tossed into my gobAnd I could afford to do that Im not rich but this place isnt expensive Its actually criminally cheap You feel like you have to tip a fiver to even things outStaff didnt even shoot me any evil looks as I nursed my cup of tea for a half hour before ordering food Exactly what I wantKimmys is a great local cafe which offers cheap delicious food along with friendly service  I came here with some friends about a month ago after a flat party in the area  We were all hanging pretty badly and needed some serious food to waken us up and make us right  Thankfully we came across this place which provides tasty breakfast rolls for only 2  I went for the bacon and egg which wasnt actually on the menu yet they still charged the same price for it  They took virtually no time to serve us and we all left satisfied well fed and markedly better than we had ten minutes before  The service is quick pleasant and served about ten people while we were in testament to how popular this place isKimmys Takeaway is the definition of a greasy spoon cafe and it serves its purpose rather well They have a great selection of beverages snacks and cakes and if youre looking for something on the go then this isnt a bad shoutThe prices are very reasonable indeed Teas and coffees are as little as 60p baked potatoes start from 200 a roll and bacon is 160 and soup is a mere 1In addition to this they also cater for the kids too with a slush puppy machine crisps and a lot of yummy looking chocolate cakes"

    "review":"Being situated on Mornignside Road The Gurkha has some stern competition in the form of other South Asian restaurants  However it certainly rises to the challenge and the food as well the service are excellent  When you enter the restaurant it feels inviting and has a particularly enclosed atmosphere with a maximum capactiy of about thirty  The tables are all quite close together and we all felt a bit crammed when I was in but this just added to the environment  I ordered the lamb bhuna with a garlic naan and plain rice which only took about ten minutes to be prepared and served  The sauce was amazingly creamy with a good range of flavours in it and the naan and rice were just the right size to make it a satisfying meal  The whole thing only cost around 8 which was definitely value for money and the waiters were polite and friendly The Gurkha also do takeaways and deliveries on all their dishes so if youre in the area theres no excuse not to give them a tryThe Gurkha with its pleated tablecloths smiling waiters and dinky interior has an oldfashioned charm that is complemented by its range of extremely tasty curries which are satisfyingly spicy without being so hot that they bring a tear to your eye  My particular favourites are the channa masala and the bhanta aubergine curry but Ive never had a dish there I didnt like  though as Ive found out the hard way the portions are extremely filling so avoid the temptation to order too much  Its location makes it the perfect place for a bite to eat after catching a film at the Dominion over the road but in my opinion the Gurkha is a real Morningside gem well worth heading to in its own rightI dont know what astounds me more the fact that Nepalese cuisine is an option for the culinarily curious or that there are so many of them that they fight over the same name  I tried to research my review for The Gurkha a restaurant in Edinburgh not to be confused with the Gurkha caf  And not the Gurkha Brigade which isreally three Nepalese restaurants with the name Gurkha in the title all in the same city  Is that a condition for being a Nepalese restaurant  I would be happy to just have a Nepalese restaurant in my home town  The closest I could find was in Vancouver and its name ishuhGurkha  I shouldnt be surprised about thatBy the way the Gurkha Im at claims itself the first and original Nepalese restaurant in Scotland  I can read between the lines and thats effectively a giant middle finger to the other likenamed restaurants  Oh and if you click the website link on TripAdvisor it takes you to the WRONG Gurkha  That must sting  The Gurkha is an adorable sky bluepainted restaurant slotted between an acupuncturist and a Chinese takeout place all three occupying less sidewalk space than a McDonalds and located on Morningside road not to be confused with Morningside place or Morningside parkoh for the love of GOD Edinburgh youre not that big of a city  Gurkha is considered large in that it occupies two storefronts one door blocked off yet it only takes about five seconds to cross on foot  What Im saying is that the businesses in Morningside are tiny its like an economy of Lilliputians  The interior was a modest collection of whitedraped tables red shod chairs and walls painted in an illadvised choice of yellow promoted as amber but coming off as corn via protein spill  The dcor was simple with few fixtures hanging from the walls  The staff was stonefaced but welcoming wrapped in ties and vests very posh considering the time of day  The effort was appreciated  I entered at lunch and noted the massive menu and listings with a very pronounced Indian inspiration  Biryani  Masala  Poppadom  Of course there would be some carryoverIve mentioned in other reviews that country lines mean effectively nothing and that true cuisine can only be graded by tribes and ethnicity and even then one must acknowledge the sharing of trends between neighbors  I say all that to educate some and prevent my lynching from others  What distinguishes Nepalese from Indian apparently is the reduction in spice and the increase of sweeter ingredients like ginger  This was confirmed with the dishes I ordered  I say dishes for lunch because the Gurkha offered a lunch special three courses for 695  The first was a trio of fried breads with huge buckets BUCKETS of various dips and curries afterIm sorry did I lose you  You seem to be stuck on that price  Thats right it wasnt a numerical error  695  Pounds or dollars despite conversion thats really cheap  The menu prices were a little higher on average perhaps dauntingly so if you only wanted to stop in for a quick bite but 695  Thats the price for a starter in any other restaurant and here its for three courses  I felt like I was robbing them  The courses were fixed but thats the brilliance  Its one thing to have a daily special a few dollars less but to have a three course combination meal it becomes a given  Who would think of ordering off the main menu with a three course option for 695  And you still get to choose if you want chicken lamb beef or pork  You still get a colossal slab of naan so large you cant see the plate its served on  After that you still get dessert  This is beyond a good value  And thankfully the food was fantastic  It was my last day in Edinburgh and the Gurkha reminds me dramatically of one of the many things I will miss about this city  The value and possibilities cannot be quantified in the number of words remaining in this review  The Gurkha may be one of several Gurkhanamed restaurants in Edinburgh but it would be difficult for the others to measure up  There are many places to eat in Morningside and if you happen to be wandering along the road and come across Gurkha THIS Gurkha its worth your timeFood:  55Service:  35Presentation:  35Value:  65Recommendation:  4255The Gurkha looks like it has been around a while decor wise The SR is a fan of Nepalese cuisine so I suggested we pop in one evening I did my normal  Im starving and plan to order EVERYTHING Much to my horror every single item I ordered was HUGE Mains sides the lot I tried to avoid looking at the SR in shame as I knew what he was thinking Miss piggy wiggy stuffing her face in the corner full of delicious curry Well I reasoned back I have lunch for tomorrow This is why taking home leftovers is a Good Idea Its been a while since we visited so I dont remember what I ordered apart from it being vegetarian that is for sure but we did enjoy our meals but struggled with the volume  so heed our warning as with others  dont order too muchThe odd occasion i venture down into Morningside in the evening i always get a huge wift of the most gorgeous smell from The Gurkha so finally after 7 months living in Bruntsfield we decided to try The Gurkha for a takeawayWOW is all i can say the taste certainly lived up to the reputation of the lovely smells that waft from the restaurant doors It was alot less spicier than Indian food but alot more flavoursomeMyself and my partner both had chicken dishes and the quality of the meat was fantasticand the pilau rice was really nice nothing like the rice you get at an indian restaurant We will certainly be trying this restaurant againThe only thing that stopped me giving it 5 star rating was that because the restaurant is really quite small they didnt really have space for us to wait for the order which took about 20 mins so we had to go away and come back but they do delivery for next time"

    "review":"Meltmongers is a really good wee addition to the Bruntsfield scene It was an ideal meet up for me and Baby Yelp as it has loads of space for buggy parking and it was a speedy hot meal I opted for the chicken and cheese toasty It was mostly quite good though had an unusual flavour in a few bites that my head translated to potentially not fresh Im sure it was just seasoning though and the tasty jalapeo relish was just the ticket for itLike Caz I did find it all a bit less appealing when it cooled For me it was the cold greasy bread that was a turn off The toasties are fried in what was to me a rather too ample amount of oilbutter which got a bit ick by the second halfThis means that youre really best to eat in here and chow ASAPNice setup though speedy food at a decent for the area priceShame it gets heaving with school kids thoughId heard good things Id read the reviews Id seen the pictures on social media It was with much anticipation that I ventured to Meltmongers for a cheese toastie The space is well utilised with tall stools and tables along the walls with a small window perch and a large window letting in natural light to help make the room feel very spaciousI opted to splash out for the grilled chicken and my companion assured me that not only was lemon mayo not strange warm that it was freaking delicious Well then sign me up We had planned on splitting the sweet potato fries and mashed potato bacon cheese melts only to be told these had been taken off the menu Thats fine theyre new theyre still tweaking the menu I get itOur sandwiches arrived and they looked great I took my first bite the chickens a bit dry Nevermind once I get to some lemon mayo itll balance it out I take bites two and three wheres this amazing lemon mayo Im just not tasting it I try bites four and five uhhhhh these bits of chicken are burnt and now all I can taste is burnt but I soldier on in the hopes of finding a pocket of this amazing lemon mayo I get through the first half of the sandwich and begin to think this lemon mayo may just be a mirageMeanwhile we have been chatting and laughing and I have been munching sweet potato fries I get to my second half of the sandwich its cold and the cheese is no longer melty and stringy like in all those social media photos its starting to congeal Maybe some of that chilli relish will help matters Except the person before has made a total mess of the bottle cap and now I have a sticky hand and still no relish for my sandwich I ask for more napkins We get given two Come on dude Im a messy eater Im essentially a child you can be a leeettle more generous with the napkins Ive just given you 650 for a chicken and cheese sandwich and another 250 for a fancy soda you can spare me a few napkins Never fear I travel with wet wipes in my bag for just these occasions I didnt spot a bathroom so super glad I had these in my bagI really wanted to like this place I love small local businesses that are doing something different and who doesnt love a grilled cheese toastie In this instance not me The fact that its across town and I feel I could do better at home for a fraction of the cost means I will not be making a hasty returnLike Caz and Emily I was a bit disappointed with what I experienced  Nothing wrong with service or the interiorThe toastie wasnt a toastie  The bottom half was lets say mushy and greasy and it was a little difficult to eat as it had no sturdiness of a toastie  Dont get me wrong the filling was nice and it was packed too  I ordered The Big Cheese: Mature cheddar American and gruyre with sweet tomatoand chilli chutney and expected a little more hit in the way of chilli  Another downside was the fact that both of the sauces on the tables were more or less finished and desperately needed to be renewed and cleanedIts not going to get me to do a hasty return  I know better places in Bruntsfield that Im prepared to part with my hard earned cash tooYes one Napkin whats that about  Seriously dudes the grilled sandwich is greasy We customers need more napkinsIf youre on a diet  the route along Bruntsfield place just got even more dangerous  First there was artisan chocolate then cupcakes cheesecakes and now MELTMONGERS  I seriously may have to consider moving to Bruntsfield as this seems to be mecca for gourmet goodies in Edinburgh  I first spotted a Meltmonger creation on Instagram  I was scrolling along past pictures of cats salads juices sunsets and BAM  A toasty gooey cheesy buttery sandwich stopped me in my tracks  Surely this must be from a trendy toasty only cafe in London  I clicked the link and was ready to grab my coat when I saw that Meltmongers was in EdinburghAfter one visit my hubby and I are ready to declare Meltmongers our lunchtime favourite  I love when people stick to what they know best  and thats just what Meltmongers do  a simple menu  done well  3 breads  soft white bloomer and sourdough and a good selection of cheesey combos  We went for the classic cheddar and american and the smokey chilli smoked applewood cheddar and jalepenos both on sourdough  And of course a side of sweet potato fries  There are only a few tables and a counter in the window  There is some empty space in the centre and as demand grows which it will Im more seating will appear You can also take away  It wasnt long before we were tucking into our tasty toasties  Generously buttered I hate when the outside edges are left dry toasted to perfection and every bit of cheese melted and oozing  Seriously good  And the best sweet potato fries ever  The last ones I tried at a burger joint were greasy and rubbery  Not these  They were thin crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside  My husband doesnt usually go for fancy chips but he ate more than I did  But the single portion was plenty for both of usThis place was love at first sight but still a tiny bit of room for improvement  I enjoyed the sourdough but  I really love toasties on granary bread  when the bits go all crunchy and nutty but there was no brown option at all  My hubby didnt have to share his toasty with me  I love jalepenos but not smoked cheese  Im sure that you could ask for changes to the set menu but would like it to be more obvious  Maybe they could list optional extras and types of cheeses available on the menu making it easier  to create custom toasties like a gruyere and garlic mushroom  hint hint And introduce some more interesting cheeses  maybe as a daily special like comte or a blue  Although Id be perfectly happy to eat that classic toasty every dayps  I nearly forgot  they do sweet toasties too  Peanut butter and banana I used to make peanut butter and cream cheese toasties  warm peanut butter is sooo good and marshmallow nuttella and banana  This could get dangerous And according to my hubby the coffee was great tooThe mothership has landed Last summer I was tempted to pack in my job and set up a grilled cheese concession somewhere  It felt like the perfect mix of personal passion and gap in the Edinburgh street food market  My personal passion for cheese toasties originated in childhood and had been reignited by Brick Lanes Grill My Cheese  Of course I was too lazy to act and kept my fingers crossed someone would fill the niche Et voila Meltmongers of Bruntsfield Super tasty toasties on a choice of breads Burger toasties and sweet toasties caramelt brownie and salted caramel Great sides like sweet potato fries best Ive had in ages Kids options  Good coffee but other drinks too limited fancy sodas  The place is very new and clean with just a few seats suited more for takeaway  Bit rough round the edges as things settle Definite revisiting rating once its settled down to see whether 5 is deserved Cheese heaven"

    "review":"For my Grandfathers 75th birthday my family threw a suprise party for him and used Greens as the caterers for nearly 100 peopleThe staff were a pleasure to work with and knew thier stuff about planning the food at such an occasion to the point where me and my father who were arranging the food were genuinly impressed by thier inputOver allthe food was of outstanding quality and cheap  at around 6 or so punds a person There was also the option of hiring staff to serve the food although this was not an option we tookIt took me until this year my fourth year living in Edinburgh to get around to going to Greens Deli I mean its not because I never wanted to but because Id only ever heard rumour of its existence and people never tended to elaborate on what they served there They just tended to see you gotta get there early or there wont be any ingredients left So one day I did Greens Deli is the typical kind of student foody place to go Its right next to the George Square library and the other abominable buildings that the university has built around George Square and where it educates its students This means that around 1 the place is packed with really hungry kids The fillings are really delicious and the price is OK for how good it is I dont know of any other sandwich place that has roasted courgettes AND aubergines AND peppers as fillings And the honey mustard sauce is delicious One warning though If you go here and decide to take your panini or wrap out to the park to eat or wherever be careful or you definitely will get covered in sauceThere are a lot of places around George Sq for students to pick up sandwiches and paninis for lunch These places seem to really have exploded in recent years that is in numbers they havent all combusted taking advantage of less people making their own lunch which will presumably change in these troubled times Unfortunately that means that a lot of them turn out to be much of the sameA friend recommended this place to me after I complained about the above I have to say I was reasonably satisfied with my visit Greens Deli does do much of the same thing but the quality is above standard There selection of tortillas and paninis are a bit more exciting that the usual norm The place itself seems clean and hygienic and the staff friendly enough I wasnt too pleased about the price but I expected this All of these snack deli joints seem to end up costing over a fiver for lunch which considering what else you get for that or just a little more at a restaurant leaves me wishing I had made my own sandwiches"

    "review":"Once you get past the overly wordy menu  its occasional errors of grammar  in one case failure to actually say what the main part of a dish is there is a lot of good stuff to choose from here be it the tapas options or the main coursesWe opted for half a dozen of the former  one of the latter between three of us and had no complaints about portion size etc Pints of Brahma at 250 Sun  Thurs rounded things out nicely  the service was never less than courteousI was first attracted to this joint because of a black board notice put at the traffic light advertising their 595 2 courses lunch menu I had the soup of the day and the spaghetti meatballs which definitely exceeded my expectations Usually for that kind of price the portions would be small or the restaurant scales back on meat but not here It was hearty delicious and superbly fillingSpent a fun night in the basement of Boteco which is quite a buzzing club at the weekends 5 entry is steep for entry to a basement but hey Theres also a 1 cloakroom charge so thats 6 out of your pocket before any drinks The place is fun though Its a nice crowd creating a good atmosphere and a lot of excellent latin beats to dance to Boteco also serves as a restaurant and bar during the day with good lunch specials and cheaper drinks during the week Well worth a visit"

    "review":"Im always dubious about chains especially when it comes to tex mex but this was actually enjoyable The food was fresh very well prepared and presented and the service good The burrito was filling with the rice on the outside accompanied by some nice beans salsa and guacamole The BBQ burger was also very niceA nice fit out too cool tunes and generally a good atmosphere Will be back for sure The fact that we paid a grand total of 480 due to the PayPal promotion was the  icing on a highly enjoyable cakeThe inside of this place is huge There are some armchairs just by the door for those just having a drink or waiting for a tableThere are cute little boothteepees you can sit in to have your dinner along one wall near the backWe got our dinner to go so didnt much get to appreciate the atmosphere but the food was really tasty and the portions were huge I liked that my burrito came with rice on the side rather than in the wrap Means more meaty filling and less filling up my belly on riceThink we will look to sit in next time as prices feel dear when the food is just wrapped in a foil bowl Though not overly expensive for the amount of food you get Will definitely be backChimichanga is eminently forgettable The wine was particularly poor and the food was fairly characterless There are many better options available The previous occupant Bar Roma was decidedly betterOverall we said: Chimichanga was a bit boring and safe Both dishes were fairly underwhelming While Bar Roma wasnt exactly setting the heather on fire it was a restaurant very wellmatched to its location with good quick service reasonable pricing and it catered well for big parties Chimichanga just feels generic and ordinary so isnt a place that will be high on my list for a revisitHaving been here thrice means I found pleasant my experience Friendly service nice menu tasty Sangria My colleagues were also pleased with the reasonable portions The menu is what you would expect from a Mexican place: burritos enchiladas fajitas and the other traditional dishes They do have a Brazilian beer which was ok I havent tried any desserts though So its Saturday night and Ive arranged a dinner for 15 of my coworkers Some of them arrive early at the restaurant and they dont appear to have my bookingBUMSIt also happened to be the weekend the Six Nations was on so town was heaving I was preparing myself for an onslaught from my hungry coworkers when I managed to get through to ChimichangaSituated just around the corner from my work in the West End it seemed the perfect solution Mexican food and cocktails galore just what I needed to keep my coworkers happy I called up with my fingerscrossedErrrr by any chance do you have room for 15 people nowYes we doThank the Lord I quickly explain to my guys the slight change in plan and push them out the door towards Chimichangas As promised the table was ready and waiting for us The cocktails are fabulous here I shared a pitcher of frozen margarita So good The food is not just boring texmex either They have your favourites of course including chimichangas and nachos etc but they lighter options too I was torn between the seabass and the grilled chicken I went for the grilled chicken and calamari to start My calamari was amazing Lightly coated and super tasty It came with an awesome chipotle mayonnaise too My chicken was simply grilled and came topped with fresh guacamole and salsa Delicious By this point the cocktails had worked their magic and my colleagues were more than satisfied PhewThe prices are reasonable here with cocktails at around 7 and mains at around 10 Definitely more to this place then just TexMex Cheers Amy"

Parmagiano Pizza It cant tell you how nice it was the crust was thin and the mozzarella was fresh I ordered the 10 inch but it was more like 14 AmazingI picked up some ice cream for desert here is my only gripe A 500ml tub was nearly 5 Go to the Tesco down the street where Ben  Jerrys is usually on sale for half thatNear PerfectEatalias is a great Italian takeaway on Leith Walk which offers good filling and tasty portions at reasonable prices  The service is pleasant and the place feels inviting with a well laid out menu  They dont just do the predictable pizzas and pasta dishes but also some fancy sounding ciabatta dishes as well as the British classics of fish and chips and smoked sausages  The whole concept of getting pasta from a takeaway seems kind of wierd to me Im sure it would be great but its more restaurant food  I went for their twelve inch hot spicy pizza which cost about 850  It was delicious and hot with pepperoni spicy beef and flaming hot green chillies  Most of the pizzas were around the 10 mark but if they taste as good as the one I had then I wholeheartedly recommend them  Eatalias isnt the cheapest takeaway yet it offers a great quality and original alternative to the other standard chippies in the areaJust brilliant  Sat night phoned in an order  for collection and correct order and really friendly staff  RecommendedIm not quite sure how to rate Eatalias I feel like a 3 is generous but 2 feels a bit mean I was disappointed thoughI lived opposite the wonderful and sadly no longer existent Marcellas in Tollcross for two years and would frequently pop by for a takeaway pasta dish which tasted wonderful and was only 3 Last night I really wanted pasta but was going to get back late from work with no time to cook How I wished for a Marcellas in Leith Then I remembered Eatalias  Id never been but it was on my way home so thought Id give it a goThe plus points: Pretty good and varied menu and the service was friendly Bad points: I missed my bus because the food took longer to arrive than Id been led to believe The prices are too high 680 for takeaway lasagna And the food itself was really nothing to write home about The lasagna was disappointing  far too much mozarella on the top and far too little ragu And way to heavy on the oregano I love lasagna but I wont be ordering that again The garlic bread was average  I might be back and if so Ill try another pasta most of which are around the 550 mark  still expensive but not as bad but only if Im really craving pasta and have no time to cook from scratchdiscovering a place nearby my flat that did good quality italian food to take away was quite a find  luckily even though ive moved from that flat ive never moved far from the area and still use eatalias when im in need of a healthier type of take away from dinnerive gotten a variety of their pastas over the years and have to say that they are all good quality  the al pomodoro with penne pasta is a favourite as its freshy made tomato sauce with fresh basil and because there is no cheese or cream i like to think this is a fairly healthy choice  ive also had the al sorrentino sauce with gnocchi which is very tasty but a bit heavy and something i tend to treat myself to on a rare occassion  i had their spaghetti cabonara once and it was only ok the sauce was lacking the taste of parmesan cheese and was rather thin  their garlic bread is decent although i feel like it could use a bit more butter  i cant comment on any of their other food as ive never gotten anything besides the pasta but as they seem to do a good business with pizza and fish and chip suppers this must be of a good qualityso why three stars well its the price  when i first started going here the pasta was about 4 which was pretty reasonable since it had quality ingredients and was made fresh  its since gone up to over 5 with most coming in around 6 or more  add in a few slices of garlic bread and the total dinner is about 10 which means i could probably have had the same dinner at a restaurant  so while this place does good food im not sure that it warrants the price attached  after all this is a takeaway not a dine in restaurant so i really feel like the prices should be more reasonableI feel the ratings and reviews for Eatalias so far are a bit skewed and unfair Most reviewers had the pasta dishes and while I do agree that the price is a bit high for pasta takeaway versus sitting in at Vittoria right beside Eatalias Im not sure the establishment deserves to be marked down for that Especially since you have the choice to go elsewhere rather than pay that price for pasta Nonetheless everyone is very well entitled to rate on what is important to them For myself and 7 year old son we like the pizza Scratch that we loooove the pizza Ive never ordered the pasta and have very rarely tried the chips think they were a tad soggy the last time but this review will be just on the pizza and service which I think both are greatEatalias is practically on my doorstep and Ive been going here every other week for 4 years Theyve certainly earned my patronage as they are always warm and welcoming when we come in They are a family run establishment and are just always so cheerful and ready to ask my son how hes doing We never order big as its just the two of us but that never detracts from the service we get Prices  very good We order a 12 or 16 half margarita half pepperoni which is always between 8 12 In my opinion this is very well priced considering Dominos or Pizza Hut always end up being around 20 for the same Maybe is because we go in to get it but even soQuality  Ive never been disappointed by a pizza here The crust is a thin Italian base and they always use fresh ingredients I personally do not enjoy thick crust pizza so its to my tastes Sometimes more cheese and less sauce is needed but after 4 years and thats my only complaint I love many of their other pizzas with some delicious toppings sadly the boy doesnt like veggies on a pizza and even better some super spicy ones All in all Ill continue to get my biweekly Friday night pizza from hereuntil I move perhaps Perhaps not I would say you wouldnt be disappointed by ordering a pizza here but everyone has a particular taste for pizza But its far better than Dominos or Pizza HutPS  they have Gluten free crusts now and I believe they are part of Taste of Italy"

    "review":"The food here was great The highlight was the Laksa I wouldnt recommend the black rice pudding Im an adventurous eater so Ill always go for something Ive never tried before There are very few things I dont like but that was one of them Ick The decor and ambience felt odd to me It felt like walking into an office We also sat near to a table theyd set up to hold cutlery which would have been more than fine in a cheap restaurant in Bangkok but not so much here given the prices One of the waitresses was very friendly and smiley The other was very surly A table opposite us was playing loud music on their phone throughout dinner which was clashing with the music in the restaurant None of the staff asked them to stop despite most diners looking irritated I think they may have even been employees of the bar downstairs Additionally my friend and I had ordered three courses each so we were at the table for just over two hours We paid our bill and stayed for around ten minutes to finish our drinks One of the waitresses then told us to leave as they had someone else waitingI completely understand that restaurants dont want people to hog tables if they are busy but it would have been much better if wed been given a time limit when bookingbeing seated or if the waitress had delivered this request with warmth and discretion Instead the manager hovered and cleaned the table next to us then the waitress ordered us out quite rudely from across the table Overall if there is a great modern Thai restaurant in Edinburgh with warmer service and a more intimate ambience Id go there Otherwise the food was great but Id love to see them improve their service and atmosphereThis place is closed until further notice as of June 10th 2015We came in for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the flavourful dishes that we had My husband and I both ordered from their winter lunch specials menu 995 for a starter and a main I had the chicken satay and a red prawn curry Both dishes were cooked beautifully with both the chicken and prawn cooked just right not overdone as sometimes it can be The red curry was especially tasty My husband had the Thai mussels starter and chicken pad thai The mussels were delicious a bit on the spicy side but we liked it Id recommend this place and I hope it thrives because it sure was empty today when we were thereMy lovely boyfriend to me to dinner here in December for my birthday and it was amazing For years I had been meaning to go to Port of Siam in Newhaven but just never got around to it So now there is one on Broughton Road that is much more convenientThe food is just divine The portions are pretty big and worth every penny It is all beautifully presented and full of flavour authentic Thai food I tried their seafood dumpling green curry and it was huge but so tastyThe attached Bangkok Bar is also lovely They have a delicious cocktail menu and are always keen to make bespoke cocktails depending on what you likeI cant wait to go backThis place has newly opened on Broughton street and is the sister restaurant of The Port of Siam in Newhaven For those familiar with original place youll know the food is top notch quality and yummy Theyve also opened up an adjoining bar called The Bangkok bar which serves Thai street food V handy if youre down that end of town for drinks and fancy a tasty small bite alternative Sometimes Thai food just hits the boozing spot like nothing else Ive not tried the cocktails but Im assured by a friend theyre worth a trip I tried the main restaurant on Saturday night as part of a big group celebrating a friends birthday They were more than happy to accommodate large groups balloons and birthday cake Nothing was an issue at all Wine wasnt overpricedInstead of my normal goto Thai options I mixed it up a bit with a starter of Marinated quail and a main of Osso Bucco Massaman The quail was delish Crispy salty tasty I would have sucked the bones dry if I wasnt trying to be a lady in front of the group Ha ha A really nice alternative to chicken Im not sure i was entirely sold on the main though which is probably my aversion to hunks of meat and bone not a reflection of the quality of the dish The meat was slow cooked and tender but I was put off a bit with the sliced bit of bone marrow in the centre I guess Im not an Osso Bucco kinda gal really Its definitely in a man food category The sauce was amaaaaazing though I had a few spoons waved my way for a tasteThis place is well worth a visit"

    "review":"Very accomodating staff as my party of 12 was delayed so we pushed the booking time back twice on the night Good range of comfort food along the lines of what youd expect in an American Diner combined with good meal deals and swift service make for a pleasant and unpretentious night outAmazing as always My favourite cocktail is the Bubblegum Daiquiri  its pink tastes of bubblegum with a popping candy rim and is made with crushed ice Just like a slush puppy Beware though the ice waters it down but its still yummy The staff are friendly the Jack Daniels dipping sauce is mmmmmmmhhhhellllooooo And its just a really cool laidback atmosphere you can chill inWe ate here whilst on holiday in Edinburgh We were seated immediately and ordered drinks They dont do any alcopops so that was a disappointment for me I had a cocktail instead which was lovely The kids ordered cokes and the soft drinks were bottomless however no one ever came to ask for a fill up and my husband went to the bar himself for it The restaurant wasnt busy so I thought they could have been more attentiveThe food was lovely though and its a very comfortable place to sit and eatshort review for a short visit  the boyfriend and i stopped in here briefly while waiting to hear where to meet up with his friends later  i did notice that the place seems to be have revamped since my last visit a few years ago and the bar area is definitely much better with booth seating along one side and proper high chairs at the barwe ordered two drinks mine was an amaretto sour and the waitress brought them over to the table  the amaretto sour was a perfectly nice drink and my boyfriend enjoyed his drink as well but overall im not super excited about tgi fridays  while i do crave that sort of american type food every now and then tgi fridays seems almost a little bit dated and under par compared to the rest of the edinburgh dining scene  there are definitely worse places but so many more places that are better for drinks or dinnerIf you really need to visit an American chain restaurant while youre in Edinburgh please do yourself a favour and walk a little bit further down George Street and go to the Hard Rock instead This is possibly the most disappointed Ive ever been going to a restaurant in Edinburgh Ive had better service and food from an airport TGI Fridays We made a reservation despite probably not needing to The waitress seemed disinterested the cocktails were expensive and weak the burger was overcooked the wings were overpriced and the onion rings were cold There are very few places that Ive ever sworn off going to again but this is one of themMeh It was a okay Did what it said on the tin as a TGI Fridays location but not somewhere I would rush back to eitherThe space is huge and would be great for groups It Was just myself and my dining partner this time though and we were shown to a booth They have a reasonable 2 course dinner deal but we just went for mains as portions here are pretty generousHer chicken strips and chips were just that  strips chips sauce Minimalism at its finest She seemed to enjoy them though My tostadas were good  plenty of guacamole and cheese and enough veggies too which was appreciatedStaff are friendly and helpful Apart from being slightly too expensive for what youre getting there is nothing inherently wrong here Just nothing hugely amazing either I would probably eat here again but for my tastes I would probably choose elsewhere first"

    "review":"I wonder if poor service goes with hotel guest andor American I have been waiting close to 30 minutes now for a soup to go and my check The beginning of my meal was perfectly average mediocre food and service Its the after meal wait I am stunned by With 4 other tables it is far from busy Side note as Im reviewing my soup came in a bowl for here as they dont do to go Well worth the waitBeen here twice for dinner and its been goodFood decent able to cater for gluten free which also includes providing bread which is always a nice touchBoth times Ive been here Ive had terrines as starter and a couple of weeks ago my fish main course was perfectly cooked salmon which I devouredIts worth checking online for deals We came previously for a friends birthday three courses and 3 matched gins for 23 Incredibly good value It is a hotel restaurant so if you are looking for atmosphere then you may have to bring you own but you will be guaranteed a lovely meal with great serviceI was discussing the other day that some people seem to have a slight mental block about dining in hotel restaurants I suppose the perception is that theyre a touch pricey but while that may be true the quality is often extremely impressiveIn Edinburgh we have some outstanding hotel restaurants The Bonham is tremendous as is Hadrians and Brasserie de Luxe and the George Street Bar  Grill and Bisque Brasserie are both rather good too Added to that number is One Square the restaurant in the Sheraton on Lothian RoadTheir menu blends locally sourced dishes with items of a more broad international appeal I had a really lovely flatiron steak and the cheeseboard a blue cheese flight was probably the best Ive had outside the Michelin placesService is as you would expect and their dining room is very swish so Id recommend a visit to this somewhat overlooked delightOverall we said I enjoyed my visit to One Square Theres a lot to like about the menu and I was impressed with my dishes Id recommend One Square as a place to visit as there is undoubted quality on offer in very stylish surroundingsEdinburgh is not short of a cocktail bar so to get me through the doors a place really has to do cocktails right  When we decided on One Square for our next book club location I was looking forward to a wee alcoholic treat while chatting about the finer points of our latest read One Square is chic and well polished  Its in a five star hotel lobby so Id expect nothing less  The seating arrangements are good with loads of chairs and small tables around the bar area  We missed out on the big cosy green chairs as the bar was crowded with conference goers but our seat on the benches was good as well  Its also worth nothing that this place has a really nice terrace bit for those infrequent sunny days Now a five star hotel bar had a classy cocktail menu with sadly classy prices to match  Two cocktails set me back 1850 but they were well worth it I wish I remembered the names of both but my second was called Avaition which was packed with booze while being very drinkable at the same time  I also enjoyed the maraschino cherry on the bottom With drinks with you get a small dish of nibbles mostly crisps and nuts but its a nice touch for a pricey drink location Service is what youd expect from a five star hotel being there when you need and not overly hovering when you dont Ill happy be popping along here again although the prices will make this more of a treat for me than a regular hauntWe visited One Square armed with a voucher from Amazon Local for a daily 3 course menu meal with wine aperitif canapes and coffee afterHotel bars and restaurants are not often visited by non hotel residents This bar is no exception Which is a pity for the people in Edinburgh that appreciate good location excellent service and fine dining I think One Square definitely deserves a place amongst the poshest of cocktail bars that this city has to offer So what it is part of the Sheraton Hotel It is still an establishment that caters for paying customers  and more The prices are no more expensive than many of the bars youll find in this category On arriving I was courteously greeted at the bar and advised that the it is table service I took residence in one of the green designer chairs in the window overlooking the Festival Square Usher hall  and the Edinburgh Castle They brought me my beer Innis  Gunn from the draft  490 and served with it a very generous selection of almonds and jumbo peanuts yum  Taking in the surroundings you cannot help but think understated opulence Dark red velour resting sofas with loads of scatter pillows to prop up against The window seats are the aforementioned green designer chairs with high curvy backs which act as sound barriers to keep the conversation to the table you are seated at Drinks menu looks like a gin bloggers nirvana  51 gins from 7 different countries  wow When seated in the restaurant we got a gin No3 and tonic as an aperitif with some beetroot and salmon mousse canapes They were shaped like mini ice cream cones According to Anita A they were yummy I dont eat fish We were supplied with 3 different kinds of bread  butter to wet our appetite a little furtherFor our 3 courses day menu choice of 2 starters2 mains and 2 desserts  I started with a crab soup  never had it before Will not repeat that It was nice but not to my taste For main I had chicken breast creamy potatoes and a squared breaded meaty thing bit of a mixed bag but well prepared All this we washed down with a bottle of Chilean Merlot 2013The dessert is where they shone the most I had a warm banana cake and cinnamon ice cream with some honey mango coulis  sharp  sweet I just wished there was more The size was decent: I wanted moreWe exited the meal with a cappuccino and a frangelico liquor sideA very pleasant meal in well presented surroundings The staff was impeccable Well done to One Square Would I go back  yes  but I will choose my own main next time instead of the limited choice of the daily menuOk so I feel a bit of an impostor with this review because the one time I went there it was for a press event so all the food and drink was free Normally a scumbag like me would be nowhere near this place Anyways the press night I attended was a great experience The food not only looked great but tasted fantastic The interior is very chic too and with it being essentially a hotel bar I felt like I was on holiday Kind of I was also lucky to try endless gin cocktails using their unique One Square Gin made by local micro distillery Pickerings at SummerhallI was told that each of these gins would normally cost 10 so I think I drank enough to fund a cheap package holiday to Magaluf The food was very very good though"

    "review":"Cloisters is easily one of my favourite locals and with so many real ales on tap it is hardly surprising The well priced ales change regularly so if you like to sample something new then this is a great place to do it The staff are friendly and enthusiastic about their beer so if youre not sure what to try first just ask Theyll happily pour you a sampler to help you decide This bar is about more than just the real ale though there is also a fine selection of whisky they stock the fantastic Thistly Cross Cider and though some regulars may gasp it is a bar known for its beer after all Ive even enjoyed a few very good wines here: they have a great selection Ive only eaten here once and to be honest they werent the best nachos Ive ever had but that was a couple of years and a kitchen and menu makeover ago so Id happily eat here again They have books on the mantlepiece and a selection of board games to play this bar is very popular though so you may be hard pressed to find an empty table to set your board up on This is a great place to meet a few friends for some great beer and some good chat and just as great for a larger gathering Ive been here for more than a few farewellsBased on my one visit this seems to me to be a great neighborhoodfeeling bar They have either 9 or 10 I cant remember at this point taps devoted to cask ales The two bartenders I dealt with were very friendly and knowledgeable about the beers One of them had already poured me my second beer when we started talking about West Coast IPAs and he told me that the manager of the bar brews his own beer which he thought I might like better than what he had just poured me He poured out the justpoured beer and produced a bottle of Conviction IPA by Elixir Brew Company and it was indeed good stuffAs to other details the bar seemed to be frequented by locals and was a somewhat older crowd at least the time I visited It was quiet enough to have a good conversation We ended up talking to a couple of guys at the next table Just the sort of place a pub should beNot a bad place to lose a couple of hours The cask ales were spot on and the staff friendly  Mixed crowd but fairly relaxed compared to my usual haunts  Havent eaten but will probably pop back in at some pointBeen once and would definitely go back  had a Pentland IPA and it was just lovelyFirst real experience with a UK pub and it was great The bartenders were polite and quick to serve you Good selection of beer on tap and good liquor selection It was a little crowded but that added to the experience Would come back here if I ever made it back to EdinburghCloisters is a great bar to go to in Edinburgh whatever the occasion  whether it is for a quiet drink in the afternoon or for a predrink on your way to a night out Situated in the centre of the Tollcross area of Edinburgh Cloisters bar is just a short walk from the city centre so it is a convenient place to reach I frequently come in here with friends for drinks and I always have a great time The decor inside is modern and pleasant not tacky and you are always greeted by friendly and warm staff Cloisters sell about ten different real ales always a bonus for the guys as well as serving some beautifully tasting wines for the ladies Cloisters Bar is always worth a look in for lunch which they serve seven days a week and it very reasonably priced Their menu includes the traditional pub food such as baked potatoes sandwiches and fish and chips Their burgers deserve special mention as they are delightful  huge and really juicy and served with proper chips The atmosphere is always lively inside but it can get very busy on a Friday night so probably best to get there early to ensure you get a seat"

    "review":"Under various names theres been a French restaurant on this site for many years In its current guise theres really little difference evident between the last incarnation  the food and wine are of a high standard although the rabbit rilette would benefit from another couple of pieces of toast the service courteous and in fact lightning quick  wed enough time to settle and choose our food but after that there seemed hardly any time to wait between the starter arriving and following its removal the main courses appeared after barely a breath If thats the case at busier times then its indeed impressiveA delightful French restaurant with reasonable priced wines scrumptious food and French staff   Well worth a visitThe food was delicious and service was friendly That being said its quite a lot of money for rather small portions 10 for a single scallop and 22 for what amounts to half a fillet of fish and one small potato Im all for enjoying food thats professionally and painstakingly prepared but nothing precludes a chef from cooking a slightly larger portion size except profiteering I had to return home and eat a sandwich so I didnt go to bed hungry I might return for a special occasionWhat an absolutely amazing meal I took my dad here during his visit to Edinburgh and the food was outstanding Our server was great too and authentically French and the ambiance was very charmingWe started off with the cheese in a filo parcel with black cherry jam which was a great combination It reminded me of a cheese blintzThen came the main courses: my dad got the sea bass special and I got the ribeye We both were very delighted by how delicious these were  the fish tasted very fresh and my medium rare ribeye made from Wagyu beef was cooked perfectlyFor dessert we shared the chocolate cake which was an awesome way to end a great dinnerTo top it all off the price for the meal was amazingly reasonable If you like French food or even if you dont check this place out You wont regret itWhat more can I say it was simply amazing and sweet sweet bliss for my taste buds Also the staff was so lovely very helpful and very good Our every need was attended toTo Bottom line is  We loved it When entering I sat at the bar not noticing the HUGE sign stating restaurant upstairs  The bar had an amazing assortment of wine and cheeses but thats it compared to the restaurant  It was perfect for me  Cheeses were so creamy and sardines delicious  Service was impeccable"

    "review":"Why do baked potatoes smell so good especially when the weather is grey and cold  The potatoes are here are good with crispy skin However there isnt a great selection of fillings  we have been spoiled by too much selection in chains However the people who work here are friendlyI defy you not to walk past Potatoland at any time of day smell the smell of delicious baking potatoes and not feel instantly hungryI do feel sorry for Potatoland though I have only ever come in here out of convinience  prefering to go to other baked potato based places to eat if the option is available I think the preblem is that the place just lacks a few little things that could make it so much better It has few fillingstopping for it potatoes and the ones that they d have are pretty basic  cheese beans etc Its also very 70s when it comes to its decoration  frankly making mke want to take my meal somewhere else for fear of growing a mullet and buying flared trousersRegardless of this the potatoes are always really nice and cheap too The smell is great too thoughIf there is one thing which certainly gets the thumbs up from me it is generous portion sizes  Thankfully Potatoland fufils this essential criterion as they only sell big mansized crispyskinned fluffycentred potatoes  Both times which I went in my first year I got my potato filled with a generous helping chilli con carne which was delicious and easily sufficed for a lunchtime meal on its own  There is however room for improvement in Potatoland  Being nestled away deep in the tail end of Clerc Street it is up against serious competition and in my opinion it would benefit from several key adjustments  Inside the place it feels dark dour and almost cramped  Further the selection of fillings just isnt adequate when compared with some of the sandwich shops nearby which are also baying for customers  Chilli beans cheese or tuna mayonnaise were some of the only options available and one cant help but question their lack of imagination  Nonetheless Potatoland is a great little business which should be worthy of competing with the best in the areaThe baked potatoes from Potatoland became my staple lunch when I was in first year at the University I find it impossible to resist the delicious potato smell wafting from the shop on my way home  The staff in this shop are efficient and incredibly friendly and didnt make me feel awkward about always going in for food like some places have The baked potatoes are inexpensive and are incredibly welcome on a cold and wet Edinburgh day There is a reasonable selection of fillings for the potatoes but the choice is not as expansive as some of the bigger potato shops in the city It is shame that Potatoland is rather tucked away and at the far end of the busy Nicolson Street as I am sure it would have a much higher trade if it was more centralIt took explorers years to finally discover the fabled Potatoland but now we finally have it marked on our maps Of course the motivation behind the expeditions was always to find a supply of cheap convenient filled baked potatoes ideal for lunch And that is just what Potatoland offersWhats that You say you want potatoes Try Potatoland Truly a land of potatoes Affordable crispy jackets filled with filling that ohso suits a potatoPotatoland at the end of the day is a place where you can satisfy your tattie desires Its not high end cuisine but then neither is Finland and look at their visitor numbersAh TattyL One of the wonders of my youth and still standing todayExcellent wee treat of a takeaway for those looking for a moderately more healthy option Just a pity they are so out of the way situated at the tail end of Newington just round the corner from Los Argentinos and across the road from ReverieProbably not worth going out your way for but a tasty option should you be in the area and at affordable prices with a quick turnaround you need not ask for more Toppings are plentiful in options and serving staff are pleasant and prices reasonableGood grief just writing about its got me hankering for one"

    "review":"Fantastic food all around The haggis is delicious the burgers melt in your mouth and the gelato is nearperfectExcellent restaurant  The service was impeccable and the food absolutely delicious Plus the manager spoke french with us Great experienceYou wont regret going here for a spot of tea and its conveniently located at the entrance to Edinburgh castleHad their Christmas menu which had an appetizer amazing soup main dish I had the fish also amazing and dessert which was just ok : besides the dessert the food was great and elegantly presented The place is right in front of the castle so it has a great view and elegant atmosphere Would definitely recommend it and would love to go back whenever I have the luck of visiting Edinburgh againThis review is based on a Yelp tasting event therefore it covers general impressions of the establishment rather than the full dining experience Continis appears to be aiming to be all things to all men From 80 bottles of wine  550 pints in the Cannonball restaurant to the 399 poncho in a cannonball in the basement gelateria everyone from fine diners to drenched tourists is currently catered for Given its location hard by the castle the tourist market is one it cant ignore but whilst the ice cream on offer is as good as youd expect from somewhere that prides itself on the Italian element of its background the rather random selection of books on sale the alcohol miniatures and their own brand coffee jams etc undoubtedly not exclusive productions rather dilute the effect of the well chosen and classier photographs adorning the walls Popcorn economics seem to be in play with an ordinary bowl of porridge retailing at 4 Admirably the restaurant aims to serve up only seasonally available locally sourced produce meaning that currently theres a lot of meat and few vegetables on the menu no bad thing As we were being advised of this though there was a confusing mention of products being shipped in from Italy which whether for here or another Contini establishment brought to mind the question of food miles and somewhat undermined the sustainability angle Situated on the second floor of the premises the Cannonball restaurant enjoys an uninterrupted view of Edinburgh castle out of its western windows The restaurant is already heavily booked up during August as meals are included in a number of Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo packages The irony being that with the erection and dismantling of the tattoo stands lasting for around five months the view will be rather obscured during that time Winter is therefore the ideal time to go for dinner if you want to take advantage of the romance of the location something I aim to get around to in order to fully round out this reviewService is too bad We waited about an hour for our meals If you want your meal to be served the day after you order then its a good choice"

    "review":"I came here just a few days ago and although small inside it actually offers really good service and food for very reasonable prices  Its tucked away deep in Leith Walk and you could easily walk right by it without evening noticing its pale green front  The service is inviting and friendly inside and gives you plenty of time to decide what sort of bread and filling youd like  I had prawn mayonnaise with salad on this really tasty brown seeded bread which only came to about 350 alnong with a bottle of coke  Although the range of fillings isnt as exotic as in other places it has great quality cheeses and meats and offers plenty of different kinds of bread  From my experience of it this place deserves to do more custom it provides good service and fresh healthy food at easily affordable pricesOpposite the fantastic attractive coffee shop Word of Mouth Super Sandwiches looks a bit lurid in comparison Tired and with cheap signage on the outside youd be forgiven for thinking it was a bit unappealingAs Gibson said however it aint half bad Selling bacon rolls for a pittance its got some great greasy spoon offerings alongside some more continental paninis Their selection is modest but done well and hits the spotThe staff are qutie chipper and for something quick and easy its worth a look Its not fine dining but it serves its purpose as a place selling snacky sandwiches A reputable enough wee business thatll save your hungry belly when youre in a hurryThere is absolutly no way you would say this place was a busy metropoletan gastrocafe noIts a greasy spoon that does paninisAlthough to look on the bright side those paninis are actually pretty good and so is the rest of the food here  its definatly traditional greasy spoon food but sometimes thats all you want A calorific bacon butty and a can or Irn Bru Hits the spot every timeThe cafe itself is actually looking a bit dated and old now but thats nothing a lick of paint couldnt solve and then this place would be as good as newI like to think of myself as somewhat of a sandwich connoisseur My ex boyfriend told me  I made the best sandwiches hes ever had in his lifeone of the reasons I broke up with him was his groveling natureHowever I wouldnt go out of my way to have a sandwich here Their paninis are dripping in cheese regardless whether you ordered cheese or not Its greasy its small and its a wee bit overpricedNot really a Super Sandwich but not awful"

    "review":"Good service  Good food although I was not keen on the burger  Milkshakes good Real American diner feel  One bad thing I would say that staff should not be eating on the shop floor even with there own clothes on then 2 minutes later you see them back in uniform and staff shouting  about there time of across the diner Oh yes and ask for gratuities when you pay with a card Thats ok in America but come on you get a weekly wageIt was so hard to decide how many stars to give this place On one hand its overpriced and a bit rubbish I mean you dont go there for the quality of the food Yet something about this retro diner fills me with so much joy Its like someone took a look inside my brain and created a diner based on all of my favourite things yes thats a sneaky reference to The Sound of Music I am in love with their ice cream floats and the milkshakes are to die for trust me You have all the classic diner trademarks here from pics of elvis on the wall duke boxes in the corners and very well selected playlist of the 60s Its a shame the waitresses dont make more of an effort with their outfits I know thats a very judgemental thing to say But I wanna see rara skirts cute socks victory rolls in the hair and topped of with a cleaver placed head scarf If your going to do a themed diner it really should be so over the top its almost tacky Still this is one of my favourites places to go if Im over at the fort So please do check it out its so worth the trip XWe went here last night for my husbands birthday dinner 3 of us at the table Me: the pickier eater Our friend: the one with the more cleansed pallet My husband: will quite happily eat almost anything So you have 3 different types of people when it comes to food attending this The American style was definitely there booths juke box at table  which we found really cool Very little selection but still fun and so on The service IWill say now was really good I thought the waitresses serving us were really nice  fun and made sure they understood our order My husband got a hotdog with cheese and bacon on topMe the burger with crispy bacon and cheese fries And my friend a classic burger with chips and onion rings The good thing about all the food combined : the bacon was actually crispy which a lot of places dont usual do well Everything else tho  The cheese on the hotdog and the fries was disgusting Cheese out of a can Squishy cheese Tasted like plastic and smelled awful  The hod dog my husband said the bun was bad quality and it didnt taste great at all Our friend said the food was very much bellow mediocre And she knows good food  So without touching the food very much we ordered deserts The best part My husband wanted to order the pancakes but new he would be disappointed with them due to the meal we just had so he for a coke float and me and our friend for milkshakes Yes they were amazing they tasted soooo good and you got a lot of out it which you can refill yourself The bill was 56something No way worth what we got in the slightest Was repeatedly compered to ikia food Especially the chips and hot dog Reminding everyone the service was really good but we just couldnt get over how bad the food was I wanted to put 1 12 star but it only allows full ones  so 2 stars One for the American feel of the place and 1 for the service My advice Only go for a milkshakeWhen I first saw Eds Diner my attention was roused A bit of American kitsch theres something you dont see much of in Edinburgh Could be goodSo when my sister decided to hold her birthday dinner here I couldnt pass it up she wouldve killed meIt certainly looks the part Shiny chrome fittings red and white leather DimeSelector juke boxes  at every booth that actually work Very cool The playlist is as you expect a mash up of all the best the 50s had to offer The staff in turn are lovely and attentiveUnfortunately this is where the positives end The food I am somewhat sad to report is rather guffI chose a simple Classic Hotdog  topped with onions and cheese sauce with Onion Rings and Eds Famous Cheese Fries Now when the hotdog you receive needs to be manually held together because the bun is of such poor quality that it has split across the bottom thus becoming more of a circus acrobat attraction than a meal you know youre in trouble The sheer effort in trying to  cleanly  keep bun dog onions and cheese sauce together frankly wasnt worth it On top of this the meat was bland grainy and downright bad the onions were fine but the cheese sauce more on the cheese sauce in a minuteThe onion rings as a side were perfectly acceptable However I would guess that was because they were not fresh and possibly packetbought and chucked in a deep fryer And as for Eds Famous Cheese Chips well the fries were average just average  and the cheese sauce how to describe it It was as if someone took a packet of dairylea slices and melted them down drizzled them over the plate It was messy it was plasticky it was tasteless If those chips are famous Im Howard the bloody DuckTo top it all off I put a pound into one of their jukeboxes 20p a song but did my playlist ever materialise Did it hell But the money goes to charity so not overly fussed on that just really fancied a bit of Burning LoveOn the whole I wont be back and I wont recommend Sister seemed to like it though so at least it didnt ruin her birthday Quack"

    "review":"The best cat cafe Ive been to The cats were all social and beautiful creatures and it was a wonderful experience Id recommend going to everyone in EdinburghIve been a cat lover ever since day dot but since I moved out of the family home many years ago I havent had a cat in the house so have missed my kitty cuddlesThats where Maison De Moggy comes in Perfect for those of us who love cats but cant practically have one at home  I got my kitty fix tenfold as there were about 10 cats wandering playing or snoozing around the custommade cat cafe They have oh so many hideyholes places to sleep things to climb and toys to play with Patrons are encouraged to pat and play with the cats just not pick them up or let them snaffle your cakeElodie the Sphynx cat Im talking to youThe two ladies working in the cafe were very welcoming and friendly answering any questions we had about the cats It is clear the cats are extremely well looked after and are free to do as they pleaseBeing a catlover its no surprise that I absolutely loved my trip to Maison de Moggy doublyso as it was a birthday gift from my fiancThe staff were a lovely combination of friendly and professional and as a cat owner I was really pleased to see the emphasis placed on the cats welfare throughout our visitWe had a chance to see most of the cats although our hour slot was fully booked and there were times when I felt a little selfconscious stroking a cat with a group of people gathered round waiting their turnI tried the chocolate orange cake and salted caramel hot chocolate both of which were great and the staff were sweet enough to add a little candle to my cake slice after I mentioned it was my birthdayOverall a really lovely experience although in future Id be tempted to go at a quieter time perhaps early morning midweekAs a self confessed crazycatlady with a crazycatladyboyfriend it seemed obligatory to visit this place as soon as we moved to Edinburgh As others have stated its very important that you book prior to visiting whilst we were there lots of walkins knocked on the door to see if they could come inside They couldnt We were told the rules:No picking up the catsTake off your shoes top tip: dont wear holey socksTry not to disturb sleeping catsAnd no you cant take them home dammitAnd then were left to try and find the many cats that were dotted all over the place We even missed one little kitty because she was all curled up in a little basket on the ceiling First off they are all amazing Theres different breeds different colours sizes and lots of different personalities They are all very well looked after and I felt quite jealous that I couldnt stay there forever being adored and fed every day The absolutely best bit of our experience is ordering cake Now Im not a sphinx cat fan they actually freak me out a bit But my goodness that cat is absolutely hilarious I was physically crying with laughter when my boyfriend tried to eat his cake The little hairless ninja is so fast and IT WILL STEAL YOUR CAKE The only reason why Ive not given this place the full 5 stars is because 7 each for entry and 8 for our coffees and cakes I think is slightly pricey It resulted in an hour of our day costing 22 which is a bit much But you know what that little cafe looks after their cats so well and they participate in lots of cat charity stuff that Id pay it again Just to see that cakestealinghairlesscat again Not quite purrfect but certainly the cats whiskersCats cake and tea What the flip is not to likeI would like to spend every lunchtime here among the fluffiness I think my cat might get jealous thoughSeriously if you like cats go They are well looked after chill as all heck get along and are just so fun and lovelyStaff are great cakes are good YES to this placeWhat a great way to spend a lazy afternoon  In the company of lovely  majestic felines  You have to prebook a time  which you can do on the website 7pp for a 1h slot as theres a long lineup of expectant cat lovers itching for their cat fix  They are quite organised and only let in the group explaining some house rules to keep the place tidy and safe for the cats We were impressed at how clean and fit for purpose this place was With all Kinds of places for cats to sleep play hide  Catering to their natural desire to be high  warm and scratch There was even a couch scratching post  We saw 7 cats I believe and many were pedigrees so worth seeing to interact with different breeds  Theyre all friendly and sleeping most of the time  They didnt seem particularly interested in playing with dangly toys but I dont blame them as theyre probably inundated with attention Cats included a Sphynx Elodie who was wrapped up in a cozy jumper and sitting in her spot near the radiator a soft ragdolls Alain  Amelie exquisite halfbrothers Norwegian Forest Cats Fabian and Jacques striking Bengal Siamese brothers named Marcel and Philippe  and a polydactyl black Main Coon Pauline who really looks like a Batman Cat You can purchase coffee and cake there  We ordered a coffee and a Japanese Cherry pot of tea  tasted nice and in loose leaf form which I prefer over tea bags I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because it was quite difficult to get ahold of them over the phone to book or ask questions  and I think 14 entrance for two people should come with complimentary tea at least Otherwise definitely worth a visit for the experience if youre a catanimal lover  Just make sure to prebook to avoid disappointment and it might be useful to know that you cant bring youre own cat"

    "review":"Its a wellworn cliche in the food business that anywhere with pictures of the food up on the exterior will be shite Whilst this method isnt 100 foolproof theres definitely some truth in it as any visit to Cafe Keno will confirmThey have pictures of bacon eggs and rolls plastered to the door The food is incredibly shite Its as simple as thatWhilst I dont seem to have had quite the same terrible experience as Gavin Cafe Keno didnt exactly bowl me over with awesomenessCafe Keno is a fairly standard affair It offers decent coffee and tea and substandard British cafe food The problem basically is that at the heart of Edinburgh on the High Street why not go elsewhere There are a million other very high standard cafe and restaurants nearby Cafe Keno just doesnt really stand out Perhaps it has room for improvement though it certainly isnt a bad placeIn its favour there is usually plenty of sitting space outside which is nice on a summers day to watch the busy tourists go by especially as they serve ice cream to go with itAs Stephanie said youre not expecting a wee cafe like this to wow you with its performance Its the kind of place you duck in to grab a roll and then go So I was very pleasantly surprised with the service I received in Cafe Keno todayServing up paninis baguettes and some bigger dishes Cafe Keno is quite spacious when all the doors are open Inside its got a nice bright colour scheme that makes it look zesty and fresh Its very clean and there is enough room to have a look at the full cake stand without feeling like youre getting in anyones wayOpting to come in here instead of spending 7 quid for a panini somewhere else on the Royal Mile I wasnt disappointed I was quite surprised to receive table service here since I just expected to wait for my food to be heated The staff were very attentive and checked to see if I was enjoying my panini The pot of tea was massive and I got at least 3 full pours out of it  its the little things yknowI liked the Greek options on the menu and the food was fresh But what did it for me was the service The staff couldnt have been nicer and that plays a huge part in how you perceive a business Absolutely lovely I would definitely recommend going here over some other places on the Royal Mile which may be more inclined to rip you offI like this place because they have free wifi and coffeetea are cheaper than other places in Edinburgh However I was not impressed by their fish and chips It wasnt that great And took them forever It was pretty busy when we were there so I understand maybe they arent used to it but I asked for water twice and I never got it Service was so slow that my friend had to leave before I get a box for the food Maybe if you are there during off season you may have a better experience I dont know I would definitely go back there if Im getting just tea or coffee thoughIve been traveling to Edinburgh frequently and Cafe Keno is a stop I make every trip  Its central on the Royal Mile so right in the heart of everything  Ive stopped in for a quick coffee while Im walking around like a tourist and Ive also stopped in for several hours to eat a meal and use the wifi  Indeed what brought me in in the first place is the great free wifi signal but the reason I come back is the people and the food  The owners and the staff are very friendly and engaging and will treat you like family if you engage them  A lot of locals eat here which a great sign  The prices are about what youd expect for a cafe in a tourist area but the serving sizes are huge  They advertise 3egg omelets but I swear there are 5 eggs in there  I particularly like the lamb koftas  Great cafeThis cafe did a nice beans and toast and the staff were very friendly but I thought it was a bit pricey for what you were having"

    "review":"I had watched work progress on Copper Blossom for the past few weeks and went in on Thursday 17th Sept for dinner and drinks It is lovely inside Even entering the bar at basement level on North Castle St it is all lights and painted pavement and so prettyInside it was beautiful highend marble tables but also part shabbychic with cream colours and plants We were able to grab one of the high tables that was fine for 5 of us and perused the menus A mini dish menu is available between 310pm and includes things like squid 6 polenta chips 3 and reblouchon 5 Many of these are not gluten free so I ate off the dinner menu Ask for the allergen menu as it contains full details of what you can have if you have any dietary requirements Staff were friendly and helpful and discussed being able to adapt dishes to what I wanted which is a nice touchMy duck was lovely but there were elements of my dish that were hot and others lukewarm like they had been plated too early One of my dining companions also had hit and miss experiences with their selection of mini dishesThe cocktails are stellar though The Blossom Martini is fabulous There is an underground space where all sorts of alchemy is being done by the team in infusing spirits and in being able to produce clear bloody marysSo I think the kitchen might just take some time to bed in as we were a mixed table with bites and main orders but the cocktails are fab and Ill definitely be back :i have to say i was totally shocked when we wandered past this place on a thursday night and decided to go in  namely because im usually in the know when it comes to new bars and restaurants in edinburgh and id never even know that this place existed  to be fair its set in the basement under ESPC and im pretty sure that nothing existed there before so perhaps my lack of knowledge was due to there not being much information floating around the social media worldanyway we decided to give the place a try as it had tables available and our other choices that evening sadly did not  i was a bit unsure as generally basement locations mean dark clubs with music that is far too loud and way too many people for my liking  however Copper Blossom is not this at all  its like an english country garden on a lovely summers day with flowers all about either on cushions or painted onto the wall as you enter  the decor is lovely and i would love the designer to do my flat when i eventually buy one in the future  there are a mix of tables high and low and a bunch of seats round the bar  we were sat at a high table which is usually fine but i found that the overly cushionyness of the chair meant that the table ended up being just a wee bit too high for me not great but maybe they could lower their tables a bit  however i did spot booths along one side and cosy looking sofas with low tables near the back so ill go for one of those in the futurethe drinks menu isnt massive but has a really good list of cocktails  there looked to be about a dozen specialty ones and im sure that the bartenders could make you any of the classics as well  i was drawn in by the Blossom Martini which turned out to be an incredibly lovely drink  it basically tasted like melted sherbet and came with a pretty flower on top  im pretty sure it was my spirit animal in drink form  had i not had an early start the next day i would have ordered these to closing time but i had to settle with just two  i will need to try a few other cocktails next time i go but i think id find it hard not to just order a  blossom martini because it was just so goodto go with my drink i ordered the chicken caesar salad and a side of polenta chips  i know that a caesar salad can be a bit on the dull side but this version was really tasty with what appeared to be homemade croutons and two strips of very crispy bacon topping off the salad  there was a good amount of chips and not too much dressing which i hate although i dont recall there be any parmesan cheese which would be the only negative point  also at 695 for a starter this was an incredibly good size definitely more of a main size than a starter for me which worked perfectly as id ordered it for my meal  the caesar salad also comes with the option to have lobster instead of chicken if youre feeling fancy  the polenta chips were quite tasty although 3 for six chips is a bit steep  maybe 2 would be a better price mark  the chips were crispy on the outside with a soft polentay centre inside  the tomato dipping sauce was nice as wellso overall for a place that i had no idea even existed i thoroughly enjoyed my evening there  the wait staff were really friendly and helpful the food was tasty and the drinks were incredibly good  i loved the whole vibe and will definitely be back  although my only hope is that this place isnt taken over by the want to be seen george street crowd or super posh studentsStopped by for a look see and stayed for four cocktails The latest addition to New Town This place is understated and has a well curated cocktail selection When so many new bars are going kitsch this place has a great vibe and isnt overly pretentious even tho the staff are in bow ties collared shirts and braces My friend and I were very well looked after our questions about our drinks very aptly answered They have a big screen which can be hidden away but the rugby world cup was much appreciated Looking forward to trying out the food menu on my next visit"

    "review":"Great hidden gem on Broughton street Cool without being overly trendy and definately benefitting from its recent refit which added a bit more space without overhauling the look and feel of the bar The food here is fantastic for the price try the roast chicken salad It takes a little longer to prepare but its well worth the wait The also do an impressive range of tequilasI got the burrito and while it was very tasty I thought the portion was incredibly small Again I need to emphasise that it was delicious but for me its important not to leave a restaurant hungry and Im not exactly a big guy and wouldnt consider myself to have a huge appetite Basically if you have a very small appetite and like tapas size meals than this is the place for you otherwise go in with deep pockets and order a few main coursesEine trashige HipsterBar mit sehr zuvorkommendem Personal und uerst fairen Preisen Es gibt eine relativ groe Getrnkekarte nur whisky und Bier probiert und eine recht berschaubare Speisekarte mexikanisch Das Essen ist absolut empfehlenswert Sehr frisch hbsch angerichtet und sehr schmackhaft Besonders Klasse: zum Essen werden zwei hausgemachte scharfe bzw delikate Saucen gereicht Klare EmpfehlungAfter 2 weeks in the UK I wanted a little taste of home and wanted to give this little place a try Who goes to Scotland and has Mexican food This girl I am glad I tried it Nice place I made a reservation on Yelp got seated right away Ordered the tableside made Guacamole which was a little on the bland side I had to add some salt and hot sauce to it to make it better Also ordered the beef fajita that was also ok had a little more flavor All in all The Basement had great ambiance the food was just ok to hold over the craving Staff was nice although it seemed like only one girl was workingI absolutely loved this place It was probably my favourite bar  that I visited whilst in Edinburgh  Heading down the steps to the entrance they have an adorable little smokingoutdoor patio with fairy lights and a real cosy feel Inside you walk straight into what looks like a very hipsterish modern fun cocktail bar The restaurant section is on the other side of the actual bar so there is a very good degree of separation between the eating and drinking areasThe bar area itself is quite spacious with a mix of wall booths and high barstools The cocktail list is fun and expansive the prices reasonable around 8 each Really really nice vibe in here Its also just around the corner from a handful of gay bars for those looking to enjoy Edinburghs rainbow triangleFriendly staff Great food and drinks super cool atmosphere I suggest the fajitas and the guacamole They make the guac at your table super fresh Everything here is good"

    "review":"Read Jenny Ls review before trip to Edinburgh since Pasha is a short walk from where Im bunking I ate a donner pita sandwich plate special with a big pile of meat salad veggies  sauce chips and drink Sandwich was sloppy overflowing the pita and quite tasty Turkish guys running it are really friendly the food was quick madetoorder and reasonably priced so its worth a visitThis place is great food is fresh and cooked well They make everything just the way you ask Finding this place has made eating on this trip very easy with dietary restrictions  cant say enough good things you def should eat here if you want something cooked quick that is healthyOnly came here once on a short trip to Edinburgh so here are my two cents:ProsCheap 56 for doner kebab holeinthewall kebab place in an otherwise posh area Location was an easy walk from Edinburgh CastleAwesome late hours perfect for exhausted travelers or late night party peopleThe guy behind the counter was very nice to our group of 4ConsSmall shop only has enough seating for around 6 diners totalFood is passable but Ive definitely had better I agree with a previous reviewer that the meat is rather dry This place is really best for its locationTip: Dont get the doner kebab in a wrap like I did  it comes wrapped in aluminium with way less veggies Others got the doner kebab pita and it came on a plate with a much more generous salad on the sideThis place varies depending on what you order it seems eaten here a couple of times with mixed results I ordered a hummous falafel pitta and some chips for my friend Once we were up the road a bit I realise had no falafel or humous for roughly 350 I got a value pitta bread and wilted salad The chips were weird and followed the pitta into the bin Previous to this I ordered chicken wings and my friend a pizza The pizza was passable and the chicken wings quite nice Two experinces one awful one middle of the road I guess The staff are great though and very friendly which is what bumped this review up by one star I would say avoid for anything other than kebabs which I am told are excellent I dont eat kebabage so no idea on that front5 stars for a kebab latenight takeaway From a bonafide Foodie Oh myBut Pasha is definitely as good as it gets as far as kebab shops and takeaways go Ive been back twice in the past 3 weeks and feel none the worse for it Not even an ounce of guiltThe reason being their chicken pitta kebab is really as fresh wholesome and healthy yes you read me right HEALTHY as you can get Its fresh raw chicken grilled in front of you with salad and a freshly toasted pitta I think if you opt for the donner  burgers  chips etc youre going to get the regular kebab hangover and I cant claim its healthy But the chicken kebabs really are outstandingI brought the boy here the first time and he was really really impressed Its been than out of a deli were his exact words So after a whisky tasting and fancy twocourse dinner that was so small we were both still hungry we actually purposely went out our way to come here for a fresh chicken kebab each After a twocourse meal Yes I know But no food baby the next day and my jeans are none the tighterEvery time Ive been Ive gotten chatting to one of the two brothers that run the place As Kevin L says its also really friendly and I have also often been called my friend Theyre both Turkish only opened recently and it really is great fresh healthy food available at 2pmIts clean small and theres no clinging grease hanging around in the air True testament that theyre doing the best they can for Edinburgh latenight postpub crawlers Just make sure youre not too tipsy that you dont actually enjoy and appreciate itBefore you judge me for all my latenight kebab eating sins hear me outOkyes I had a hankering for hot meat in a sandwich at 1130pm on a Thursday night After a search on the Yelp app showed up no open Subway outlets nearby I realised I would have to resort to a kebabKebab shops in Scotland are generally unhealthy Greasy often coupled with chips probably only 5 meat But I was desperateSo when I stumbled upon Pasha I was very pleasantly surprised Clean bright with a menu that included chicken kebabs and a very clean fresh looking salad bar I ordered my chicken kebab and waited as Ali this is the guys name we had time to chat and become acquainted grilled me some fresh chicken Not preheated nonsenseAs I was waiting we got chatting Turns out its a new store only 6 months old and Ali and his brother run it having just moved over from Turkey themselves 6 months ago So this is genyooun Turkish kebabs folks Yes its a takeaway outlet that will cater to a lot of latenighters but it lacks all the grease curry sauce and saltvinegar of your regular kebab shopsThe kebab itself was delicious In a huge wholemeal pitta bread with fresh salad and charcoalytasting hot chicken mmmm num numIf youre in the Tollcross area and have a hankering for some late night snackage I couldnt recommend this place enough Even if youre on a healthy January kick the chicken kebab is a winner Its the morning after and I dont have the foodbaby of shame  winThey also do FREE home delivery which is pretty awesome Ive uploaded photos of the menu as they dont have a website For all your kebab needs check it And say hi to Ali for me"

    "review":"Vanavond heerlijk genoten van een Turks menu met kip zo uit de oven Het was erg smaakvol alleen de salade een beetje sober De bediening is erg vriendelijk ook al is het erg druk Het is een klein knus restaurant als het wat kouder is buiten merk je dat de deur open gaatWhen I first discovered the Turkish Kitchen a couple of years ago it didnt look anything particularly special from the outside I find this is very common with the places serving the most authentic food Recently the frontage has been spruced up but thankfully the food remains at the same high standardAs the name suggests its a real family affair  you feel like a guest at their house eating homecooked food lovingly prepared and representing the best Turkish cuisine has to offer It is also priced to suit most peoples pockets  I really hope it stays that way I cant wait to visit againThe best hummus Ive ever had Best even better than what Ive had in Israel I also had the Lamb with tomato onion and mushroom It was all so tasty Great portions at  great prices The owner and chef is so sweet and helpful when ordering Dine in or take out it is nice for bothVanavond hebben we hier gegeten Het is een klein restaurant met losse tafels aan de ene kant en aan de andere kant langs de muur een bank met gezellige kussentjes De bediening is erg vriendelijk en helpen je desgevraagd met je keuze te maken Het eten was lekker en voldoende ik koos een gerecht met lamsvlees en aubergine uit de oven dit wordt geseveerd met een bordje sla en een dotje rijst Het ovengerecht was lekker lamsvlees was mals maar het bordje sla was zielig Erbij nam ik een turkse rode wijn die erg lekker was Als het wat drukker wordt merk je dat je best krap op elkaar zit je jas kun je beter bij de deur aandoen anders zou je iets om kunnen stotenBuiten staat een vriendelijke man die Sharif heet hij zegt zelf Omar SharifAl met al een leuk restaurant om een hapje te eten Turkish Kitchen was a thoroughly decent inexpensive meal for a group of us who hadnt booked a table in the city centre on a Friday nightOn sitting we were brought some bread and the most amazingly tasty dip ever  I need to know whats in that dip because it was the highlight of the meal  Not very hungry I opted for the Turkish ravioli which despite not being listed on the menu came with a side of salad and rice  The sides were a bit awkward and somewhat wasteful but were certainly tasty  The ravioli left a lot to be desired primarily because it was so overcooked it came apart the minute it I tried to eat it  The taste was fine though nothing compared with my other experience with Turkish ravioli which was such a shame because I was expecting something really fantastic  I probably should have ordered something kebabey like everyone else but I just wasnt in the mood for a meat feast  Everyone else seemed happy with their meals though  One weird thing was that when we ordered beer we got glasses which appeared all different sizes and smaller than what you would expect of either a pint or a large bottle It was a really good option for a group looking for something cheap and cheerful but is in my opinion not Edinburghs best Turkish by a long mileWere regular visitors to Istanbul so have been exposed to a fair amount of Turkish cuisine be it homecooked in restaurants or from takeaways This place ticks a lot of boxes giving diners a good representation of authentic Turkish dishesOverall we said: it was a lovely lunch and a steal at the bargain price of 650 for 2 courses and I recommend that you go if you are in the area and hankering for something different and good I think Id like to return one evening to see what the rest of the menu is likeor just to grab a lahmacan or 5 to take away"

wandered into my very own CheersIf imitation is the sincerest form of flattery Sygn should consider itself well and truly flattered From the menu both the selection of food and the design of the menu itself to the regular daily deal promotions well priced burgerpizza with cocktail Sygns influence is stamped all over Whistle Stop Im torn between trying to guess whether this is another venture from the Sygn team I dont believe it is a close friend who has been given the owners blessing to emulate them or a brazen competitor with little sense of subtlety Answers on a post card Not that all this is really bad thing Sygn is a favourite of mine so Im happy to see anywhere pop up that aspires to offer a similar level of quality So how did it fareService was relaxed and friendly The burger patties were made up of a good blend providing a good meaty flavour to them These were served on airy brioche buns rather than the oversized floury baps that bars often serve burgers in The burger dressing was a bit sparse leaving the bun a tiny bit dry but was quickly rectified using the condiments on the table Overall not a bad burger and a lot better than most local bars would serve up The pizza was to a similar standard with a nice crisp thin base and interesting toppings pulled brisket for me If youre like me and like plenty of cheese on your pizza youll be well served here though there may be an element of quantity over quality as it did taste of the slightly overprocessed variety A better cheese blend and they would be top notchWhilst not quite at the same standard as its spiritual role model just yet theres already a lot to like about Whistle Stop Time should only refine this and enable it to solidify its own identity Some of the more unique items on the menu egg benedict pizza philly steak egg roll pulled brisket pizza already nods toward this  One worth keeping an eye onThis reopened as Whistle Stop Barbershop in September to replace Rascals Its got some barber shop themed decorations but its not over the top I met a friend for a quick lunch which I dont think well repeat here The service started off great with drinks orders taken and delivered promptly then our waitress went on a break and the other two staff ignored us for 10 minutes until we asked one of them if we could order It then took another 15 minutes for a Cobb salad and grilled sandwich to arrive There was no check back on the food and we had to grab someone again to ask for water The original waitress came back from her break in time for us to ask for the bill and then returned with 12 change from a 18 bill paid with a 20 note as the till said so Considering there were maybe four tables for lunch the service was very disorganised The food was nice and the atmosphere ok but with so many other options in the area with lunch special deals I dont think Ill be back for food but might try it for drinks as the cocktail menu looks interestingI visited on a Friday night for a friends birthday drinks and because its the midst of Christmas party season the place was mobbed However a couple of booths had been reserved for us and we werent neglected by the staff who swung by reasonably frequently to take orders for drinks as well as foodI only had a wee order of chicken wings but they were perfectly tasty  hot and not bad for only 350I discovered an elderflower  gin cocktail on the promos menu and that was me set for the night 395 for an elegant looking short drink floral and with a hint of cherry from the maraschino liquor  super tasty Id go back just for theseTheres apparently a live DJ on Friday nights and we were enjoying the tunes  we were all boogying away in our booth to the classics anyway Must point out how super hospitable the staff were  friend brought birthday cake and they brought it out with added candles and all the necessary plates knives and forksIn the spot previously occupied by the very disappointing Rascals comes a really smart new cocktail bar and diner From the team behind Tonic the food covers diner classics with burgers hotdogs sandwiches salads pizzas and chicken n waffles Their cocktail menu is inventive and they have a very wellpriced list of specials While theres some room for improvement on the drinks I really liked the place particularly the burgers so Id suggest you check it outOverall we said: I was impressed with the Whistle Stop Barber Shop The atmosphere is welcoming and has none of the too cool for school feel that the name might conjure up for you Id recommend a visit and look forward to going back again myself to explore more of the menuStopped in here yesterday for a bite to eat for lunch as I had been meaning to since I heard there was an American place opening up in Edinburgh As an American I love hot dogs and American food so Im glad I finally got the chance to try The Whistle Stop My boyfriend and I came in late for lunch and it was pretty quiet but I was impressed by the atmosphere of the place it seemed like a cool place to catch a drink and hang out with friends after work or at lunch time There are a few really big booths there so it is good for groups of peopleWe ordered the fried tomatoes fried chicken bits Philly cheesesteak egg roll and a hot dog I keep ordering fried tomatoes wherever I go in Edinburgh and not getting what I expectand these werent amazing either Too soggy Oh well All of the other food was really good The best thing was the Philly cheesesteak egg roll which I actually thought would be weird I would absolutely order that again Fried chicken was quite nice and the hot dog was pretty close to a standard American hot dog that I know and loveI will definitely update this review once I try their cocktails as I saw the bartender making some and they looked quite amazing and delicious"

    "review":"Average food Poor service We had booked a table at restaurant When we arrived they were not aware of our reservation and we were seated at the bar area No apologies were given We were a party of three and they tried to squeeze us on a table for two people So we asked to be moved and fair enough they moved us We werent given a drinks or food menu for a long time We called the waitress and she came over asking us if we were ready to order Unfortunately we werent as we hadnt been given any menus We finally ordered drinks and food at the same time The starter was impressive and very tasty I had the scallops served in squid ink garlic and parsley butter I had the stone bass for the main which was bland and below average We didnt have dessert as there was nothing exciting on the menu and we wanted to leave There is a compulsory 10 service charge on the bill which I dont mind paying most of the time However in this case they did not deserve it as the service was very poor I love food and I dont usually regret spending on it In this case however the poor service exceeds the quality of their food There are far more places in Edinburgh with similar prices better quality food and far better service The bar has a good selection of whiskies They serve the rare 18yearold Yamazaki by the glass Despite this I would not return due to the poor servicePopped in for a few drinks The bar area was really busy so we sat in the other area Im not sure if I like the new layout  location of the bar It was so crowded  being smaller seemed much noisier Maybe Im just getting oldThe cocktails were good standard central Edinburgh prices Service was efficientIf I could Id give 25 Im not sure where to start but basically I think this is a review of 2 distinct parts First part the food is very good Excellent ideas very well presented executed and seasoned A total pro is in the kitchen with a great team Its not cheap food but who cares when its such a treatOther part thankfully the excellent food saved an instantly terrible service experience that continued through the whole mealLed through as if entering a funeral service to a massive and empty dining room Our server the whole time knew NOTHING about the menu Wrote down our orders with painstakingly slow awkward exchanges Painful painful painful I counted 8 members of staff most of whom just chatted at the barwhichneveroncedispensedadrink until we had to get up and chase our drinks or ask for more water or remind them of something wed asked for Many times One glass of wine was almost 15 minutes in the delivering Give me strength None of them could carry a drinks tray nor plates of food properly Every one looked so awkwardWe wondered GENUINELY whether it was a special day of experimenting or something whereby they stopped passing cars and asked whoever the driver was to come in and do a shift As if we were really being served by nursery nurses taxi drivers posties schoolkids or maybe actors So much moneys been spent on every tiny detail with a focus on salt  pepper dispensers and waiters shoes But they forgot to hire experience personality or enthusiasm and forgot to train anyone or even go over the menu It was just ridiculously amatuer and frustrating and I in no way left like it was a treat to be there It was a massive drag I got a headache The food was therefore  a surprise since it was so good and gladly did not reflect the quality of welcome or hospitality We wont be venturing back for quite some time because it is a big spend to risk on a new place with so many issues shame coz it be a great place of foodie delightYall know I take my dining experience seriously especially when I go to a place that requires me to dig a little deeper in my pocket to pay Im happy to do that on occasions since food and dining out are some of my life passions but be sure Im going to be critical One of my fave people was here from Manchester over the weekend and we wanted to try a new place to eat that served something of the new modern Scottish food I was excited about this place because the restaurant looked amazing from the website and the menu showcased Scottish meat fish and produceThe first negative happened when I called for reservation To be fair it was a late request for reservation on a Saturday night but I wanted to try my luck Not surprisingly the staff said they were all booked and the next open table was at 9:30pm Fair I told my friend this and she said hold up Text me back and told me they lied Apparently she was able to get reservation through opentablescom That annoyed me So lesson learn Go on open tables for reservations instead The restaurant looked similar enough to its picture on the website but it did remind me the many times I see someones pic on a dating app and I meet them and Im like wtf When was your pic taken AnywaysI was starving and I just wanted food We barely got the menu and the waitress came up and asked for our drinks order Well first off we just literally sat and we werent given a drinks menu So no I dont know what I want Thanks After waiting a while for the waitress to come back and finally get our drinks and food orders we sat there for a bitWe got a bottle of prosecco and it wasnt cheap Now I dont really care if Im getting served and the server making sure my glass is full of wine but in this case I did mind cause the bottle was expensive and in any other restaurant the server would have made sure my glass was full The server in this case never bothered checking and we had to serve ourselves The food finally came and the pigeon breast with beet salad was tasty My friend got the scallops with squid ink risotto I was really impressed with the flavours of that dish The scallops was cooked very well Tender but still soft We both ordered the stone bass with mussels This was ok The mussels didnt taste fresh and the fish wasnt amazing The cream sauce went decently with the fish and spinach while it didnt do anything for the mussels For 21 this fish  dish is not worth getting cause I was calculating it in my head and  I probably would have spent the same amount or less if I cooked the dish for my friend and I myself Just saying We didnt bother trying their desserts cause I wasnt impressed and I just wanted to go When we got the bill  a hefty one I saw that they included a 10 service fee I was so annoyedconsidering their service was poor I frankly wouldnt have tipped them especially since they barely did anything and I had to walk across the entire restaurant trying to find a server to get our bill so we can go The food was ok in this place but frankly Id go to another restaurant that can probably cook as well charge for the same or similar price and have better serviceMust say this is one of my favorite spot Great menu with full bar menu from whiskey wine champagne gins and cocktail Great food and menu and despite its great food and excellent customer service they are never pretentious nor snobby like Bon vivant or tiger lily Mixed crowds from old and young but would say more mature crowds rather than younger crowds Definitely I would recommend anyone go check out their food and spirits"

    "review":"Established in 1974 Goodwill is a Chinese take away located on Edinburghs Newington roadThe food at Goodwill is always a safe bet  the menu isnt revolutionary an indication of the businesss age but there is a large choice and  the food is stuff you will recognise  although stay away from the British Dishes section of the menu Scary The food itself isnt the best I have ever tasted but for the price nor is it the worst and I would come back here again  if only for the friendly service and free prawn crackersThere is a delivery service available which is free over 25  but this seems pointless as other takeaways in the area deliver for free Shame reallyGoodwill is a take away showing its age but for the price of its food it is a good little place for a spur of the moment carry outGoodwill Chinese Carryout is a great place to order a decent Chinese meal from in Edinburgh They are open seven days a week which is pretty ideal and stay open till midnight most nights so it is great place to pop into on your way home from a night out if you fancy a tasty meal They have a wide range of authentic Chinese dishes and the meals are very well priced with main meals about 8 The food isnt the best Chinese food I have ever tasted but it does the job The portion sizes are fairly decent and I tend to order safe and have the chili beef which is quite spicy but very tasty Goodwill Chinese Carryout also offer a set menu which I chose once and was not disappointed  A delivery service is available which I have used a couple of times as I live quite a walk away and if your order is over 25 they will deliver it free which is great if there is a group of people ordering together  It is shame that is at the end of Newington Road as it is quite far away from the Uni but it is worth the walk to get thereBack when I lived in Pollock Halls in my first year at uni Goodwill was the Chinese takeaway of choice  It was recommended by a good friend of mine and I was happy to partake in any food bought from hereContrary to what my photo may suggest they provide meals and not eals as they sign currently says  They provide the normal range of Chinese dishes and also a home delivery serviceWhilst they might not be amazing in the culinary stakes they are a convenient service that will hoover up a lot of student trade from the Newington area  I dont normally go for Chinese as a takeaway preference but Goodwill are a safe bet for some wholesome takeaway goodnessI used to come to Goodwill Chinese Carryout pretty frequently when I lived in Pollock Halls in my first year as it was close by and always did the business with a well priced and tasty meal  The guy who always served us was friendly and inviting and the food never took long to arriveThe menu has a good range of  mostly  authentic Chinese dishes the majority of which you will have seen before  However theyve usually got a specials option which changes weekly and offers an interesting take on classic dishes  Id usually go for the crispy shredded beef with fried rice and a bag of prawn crackers which would come to about 750 and tasted great  Goodwill is a good quality value for money takeaway which is well worth a lookThis could and should have been the worlds most convenient chinese takeaway for me during my first year of uni But unfortunately it was about as far from that description as you can getI dont want to be accused of making any slanderous allegations but to put a long story short Ive got ill both times Ive eaten here as have my friends The first time I will admit wed had more than was healthy to drink and so we put our illness the next day down to that giving the Chinese takeaway the benefit of the doubt After all it was the Chinese takeaway that had given us hot food at 00:30 after wed left the pubThe second time thought we were a lot more dubious The food was tasty I will admit but its up to you if youre willing to risk spending the next two days in bed"

    "review":"The Lazy Gals BibleEntry 50:I go to great lengths to avoid cooking on a regular basis so I feel like ive become a bit of an expert when it comes to take outdelivery options Of the thai ive tried all two of them this place currently ranks in my top spotIts a tiny little place tucked under the stairs as you make your way into Stockbridge All of five or six tables I was pleasantly surprised when I popped my head in the door last week  its cozy and cute Would make an excellent little date spot if you arent like me and a lazy sod who prefers pad thai to be accompanied by pajamasMy first go round I wasnt overly impressed I got the vegetarian spring rolls and a stir fried option with crispy chicken the name escapes me and I cant seem to find it on their online so just keep crispy chicken top of mind when you peruse and I would pass on both in the future The spring rolls were half decent but definitely nothing special and the stir fry was kind of like the microwave stir fry options you get at the shop and remember: expert on this stuff It was decently tasty but entirely unmemorable and definitely not enough to coax me backExcept as stated time and time again: im lazyWhich means on a Thursday night when im craving thai food and this is the closestoffers online orderingdelivery spot in the neighbourhood Im going to give them a second chanceGosh Im glad im lazy sometimes My second take out experience from this place was miles better than the first For my second go round I kept it safe with chicken satay vegetarian pad thai and sticky rice Lets break it down:Chicken satay: this may be the best satay ive ever had It comes with a peanut sauce and a cucumber sauce and just go ahead and dump that all over your meat on sticks Its delicious and well balanced  but extremely messy Hence why this would make a perfect take out anyone who sees you dribble sauce already likes you enough to watch you eat in your pajamas but a pass for date night munchies dribble privileges come laterVegetarian pad thai  im one of those obnoxious people that roll their eyes when people order pad thai because its so unadventurous but consider me smacked upside the head This dish is incredibly tasty and the ground chillis adds an unexpected kick Its also nice to see theyre making it with proper tamarind sauceSticky rice  ok this is going to sound loopy but this was my favourite Its surprisingly easy to mess up sticky rice and this was both a good portion and an excellent midnight snack Throw some left over peanut sauce on that bad boy and you have snacking excellence I will definitely swing by for more of this in my lazy futureSo consider me turned  I am definitely a fan of this little spot and am quite happy that I gave it a second chance Its a solid choice for lazy guysgals everywhere within 5 milesKingprawn crab parcels Thai prawncrackers Monkfish king Prawn squid  scallops in a spicy red Stir fry  lime leaf  Thai jasminerice streetbox stockbridgelocal stockbridgelocal yumThe most exciting thing about moving is exploring your new hood and finding new local haunts As a new Stockbridge resident I was excited to try some local takeaway options  First on my list was Street BoxIm a fan of Thai and a fan of milder creamier curries especially Throw in a coconut base and thats my idea of heaven right there So my glance over the menu was a quick one  The Kaeng Sangtong was going to be all mine yellow curry with coconut milk potato and peanut topped with crispy onion YES And a side portion of coconut rice Yes pleaseMy dinner dreams had well and truly come true and the Kaeng Sangtong was a flagrant delicious delight leaving me more than fulfilled The crispy onions on top were a nice little extra and there was the perfect amount of sweetness and heat Portion size was good and I was able to have the leftovers for postwork dinner the following night Thats always a bonusService was bubbly and bright just the kind that has you back for more  That and the beautiful Thai flavours are tempting me backYay new Thai takeaway in Stockbridge Its effectively the new location of Ruan Siam with less of a dining room and more of a takeaway and delivery focus Our order was ready after a very brief wait and we whisked it home to devour it Everything was tasty and portion sizes were reasonable At 27 for a veg pad thai a curry and a soup it was on the expensive end for takeaways which is about the only negative I can think ofI was in town visiting a friend and she lived quite close to this new little spot and for days had been begging me to stop in with her and try it out because I had heard their sister restaurant was THE BESTWe popped in one day and for such a tiny little space its laid out quite well and contains a fair amount of seating without being cramped and is really bright and has an airy feel There were already a few groups of couples eating and waiting on food and it smelled dang deliciousIm a pretty big skeptic of most Thai places having lived there and living in Canada where peoples palates are not necessarily looking for authenticThis place hit the spot The spices were incredible and rich and the servings quite large even for take away We ordered a bunch of items to try them out and all of them were wonderful They even gave us shrimp chips I am a sucker for these Ok now Im hungry againI love Thai food and chanced trying this place waking by  It seemed busy with away orders  Its small inside with one table and two areas against a wall and window I tried the Pad Prig with chicken and rice because I like the spicy and tangy description and it was a new item Service was friendly and super fast  Unfortunately  I was disappointed in the food as it was much too salty Perhaps it was catering to Western tastes but having been to Thailand several times I know what good Thai tastes like Thought it was dear as well for what it was  I wont be going back"

something to tickle your tastebuds on the massive menu First time Ive come across oolong being sold in Edinburgh so theyve won me over They dont yet appear to have been adopted by the blue hair rinse set so enjoy it while it lastsEteaket is my new favourite tea house With bright blue and pink decor a range of tables and comfy couches the interior looks divine if perhaps a little intimidating for the macho male Eteaket crosses the boundary between common cafe and hightea hotel venues  it is not snobby or expensive but you are greeted at the door and shown to a table which instantly turns a casual cuppa into a delightful afternoon outing There are two pages of tea to choose from black green white fruitherbal redrooibos  theyre all there and a delicious array of scones breads and other bakery items so there is sure to be something to tempt your taste buds Your tea will be served in delightfully mismatched pots and antiquey looking china cups and saucers with a timer so you know its brewed right Our table of four all received our teas and treats at the same time The service here is impeccable the decor delightful and the ambience awesome This is a great place for an afternoon outing with the girls or to take refuge from the weathershopping The scones are popular though so make sure you order quick if you dont want to miss outI met up with a friend here and we both rely enjoyed our treats  I got a apple and blueberry tea latte with soy milk that was really yummy and a piece of chocolate beetroot cake  Red Velvet cake originally was made with beetroot to bring out the chocolate taste so I was like Im sure this will be good  And it was A good sized piece too Lovely  chocolaty but light in texture cake with a good butter cream frosting I think the difference is cream cheese frosting in what makes a a chocolate beetroot cake not a red velvet cake Anyways it was delicious and I will be sure to come back and have another pieceAlso so many different teas to select from Will be bring my tea snob husband back here to choose from the pages of teas to tryI really love the concept of Eteaket but unfortunately its execution is not up to par I have visited Eteaket twice I vowed never to return after my first experience but had a change of heart when a friend and I were looking for a cafe near by I came with my boyfriend the first time I visited As we walked in I giggled at my boyfriends choice as its definitely a ladies place Its cute I think thats the best way to describe the decor All pink and turquoise We ordered tea scones and half a sandwich each  It took over 45 minutes to receive our tea  just the tea I dont even know why we stayed I think it was a combination of being in the middle of town on a Saturday and everywhere else being full Still 45 minute for tea is cray cray The good: the tea is delicious and I love the choices that are available Its the largest selection of tea that I have seen in Edinburgh The bad: Meh Eteaket isnt really bad per se I hope that Ive just had a really bad experience Ill say that in my opinion the scones are nothing to rave about it The ugly: The service needs improvement Im not rushing backEteaket has got a good thing going onI popped in here for a hot beverage fix on my lunchbreak and was relieved to find that at 1pm there was still lots of free tables none of that uncomfortable chaotic lunch time rush thing happening I was the only person by my lonesome but felt more than comfortable settling in with a good book and hot cup of brewI opted for the mint tea infused hot chocolate Oh yes tea infused hot chocolate Ive always loved the idea of mint hot chocolate but have often found that it tastes a little more greengoopystuff then real peppermint I asked the lovely lady behind the counter how they make it and it really is just dark chocolate cocoa mix added to a small amount of brewed mint tea Charmed Im sureThey have a very impressive tea listing scrumptious looking cakes on the counter and a nice little half sandwich and soup combo which I will certainly be trying one cosy lunchtime soonMy friend and I visited here on a Monday afternoon and I was left with a bit of a meh feeling  We both had tea and a scone and whilst the tea was lovely and there are LOTS of choices the scones were bad  For a place that specialises in these kind of things youd think their scones and cake would be amazingbut sadly it was not to be  They arrived cold for a start am I alone in thinking scones should always be served warm and were clearly not freshly made that day  Now we all know scones really need to be eaten on the day theyre made they dont last well I asked the waitress if she could warm them up which she did happilybut unfortunately they were still dry and disappointing  Not inedible but not something I would get again The clotted cream that came with it was nice enough but the jam described as homemade looked and tasted anything butI also ordered a slice of white chocolate and strawberry cake to take home to my boyfriend but alas that too was dry and disappointing  The place itself was nice service was good and everything looked clean enough but Im not sure Id be back"

    "review":"Possibly the best name for a shop ever Rotato delivers what it promises  potatoes cooked while rotating slowly on a spit roast See what they did there Located so close to the university its silly Rotato is a fairly new place hidden away under a cafe  but dont be put off by this When I first entered Rotato I was shocked  I had been expecting a small dark counter and not much more Instead I found a modern eating area bar type service area and beautiful furnishings Stunning Of course you can take out as well but Im not sure you would want toI really cannot give any higher praises for this place The potatoes are cooked to perfection  crispy on the outside and fluffy and light on the inside  just how a baked potato should be but so few places manage to get it rightRotato admittedly have one downfall  it only has a selection of 7 fillings for your potatoes but these fillings are simply sublime  well thought out stunningly tasty and sometimes even odd combinations that work so well its a suprise you have never though of it before There are being new fillings added to the menu all the time but the ones that are available now are absolutly perfect Having tried the entire menu now I would suggest going for the adventurous sounding Aussie Mongrel  chilli coleslaw cheese and sour cream MmmmmmI love this place I really do and I wish that Yelp could give some sort of extra special sixth star  this place deserves itMy life is full of boring assessments at this moment and you can tell this has happened when my only highlight of the day is a baked potato But let me tell you why:I followed the smell of baked potatoes and there it was an underground baked potato shop I thought I had found a well known secret but as my friendly pointed out the place was full which was probably helped by its big red sign Swallowing my pride as a secret hot spot locator I loved their  baked potatoes perfectly crisp skins with white fluffy inside They really dont have a huge selection of fillings as Jonathan M pointed out but you will find that the ones they do have are very good indeed Perhaps we are spoilt with having too much choice but bad quality it comes to a surprise to us when this balance is reversedHaving said that the girl who served me seemed to be having a very bad day and was very unfriendly However this baked potato shop left an impression and was certainly not like other baked potato shops in the area the interior was clean and modern with some sitting area as well Do you understand now what I mean about highlightHandily located underneath the excellent Press Coffee and right by all the central area uni buildings Rotato great name is a nice little place for a Friday lunchtime treat I say that because its bloody expensive They give all the fillings stupid irritating names like The Vespa chicken pesto rocket and The Bigos sauerkraut and pork But if you can overlook this little mishap youre staring at a huge crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside delicious filling packed baked potato They really are the best potatoes Ive had They cook them in a rotating oven to maximize even crispynessThe fillings are good the staff a great and the potatoes are excellent Its just a shame its so expensive otherwise Id go all the timeThis place is so ridiculously close to uni that I was always shocked it wasnt busier when I went inIts cheap and the food is good I mean hellooooo baked potatoes Who doesnt love baked potatoesThe options are few but theyre damn good options I think that would be its only vice: limited options A makeyourown option would also be nice but considering the space and the prices Im pretty happy with how it is alreadyBest baked potatoes in Edinburgh Tucked away near the uni its always busy at lunchtime but you never have to wait long My favourite is the Aussie Mongrel  although if youre feeling in the need for something a bit healthier Chicky Pea is the one Any place that turn a potato and some chickpeas into a tasty filling lunch is a winnerThe potato was SUPERB It was huge and filling really crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside Had the chicky pea topping which was really lovely but I am wondering if the chickpea salad was the as the one that is supplied in every delisandwich shop in Edinburgh The company I am thinking of does a spicy bean pate which is quite nice comes in little square containers for regular shoppers to buyI am not saying that this is necessarily a bad thing because the chickpea salad was lovely and there is skill to sourcing good ingredients and suppliers however the menu in Rotato is small and limited  it would be nice if the items on it were homemade rather than bought in All in all a great lunch was kept wonderfully sated for the rest of the afternoon"

    "review":"Giving this a three just now as on consideration Id not rush back in the near future The food and drinks brook no complaints as the steaks we had were both of a good size and well cooked as were the roast veg  chips whilst the wine was well priced and the french martinis tasted as expected The service though as noted by other reviewers is where the place lets itself down On arriving we didnt even have to give our name as the waitress merely asked if wed booked via Groupon and then seated us Both she and the waiter were polite though and the time between ordering and having the food in front of us was by no means excessive but the fact that they have 2 or 3 different deals with discount sites on the go seemed to be causing a bit of confusion we were offered dessert as inclusive despite it not being part of the deal wed bought and by the time it came to get coffee which was in the deal wed seemingly become invisible and so just left cash on the table to cover the wine  side orders The deals are obviously increasing the custom here but possibly to no great effect if folk are put off from returningBURGER WATCHHad the Edinburger: Beef burger stuffed with Whisy Sauce topped with two Haggis Fritters and served with an Irn Bru Ice Cream FloatWasnt interested in the float so swapped for a Diet Coke but the burger was rather impressive Fresh homemade patty exploding with whisky sauce stacked very high with its haggis fritter double whammy Very messy stuff but very enjoyableOnly cons were that the patty although amazingly thick juicy and tasty was a little small for the bun which in turn was dowsed so much in burger juice and whisky sauce that it began to break apart in my hands A wider patty would have been more accessible to being cut in half facilitating a less messy feedGood burgers to be had here Good range of beverages and really polite and sociable staff Very accommodating and reasonableThis is also the official Edinburgh Arsenal Supporters Club match day venue so they get an extra point for that  because they always have the game on and are fantastic hosts lost the reception for a matter of seconds but apologised by way of a few bowls of chips  very toughtfulMy fiance and I had planned to grab a bite to eat at Nobles next door to here and found they were way too slammed to get a table so we wandered into here The atmosphere in the Constitution Bar is very nice I could have seen it being a place we frequent a lot but unfortunately the service we received was abysmal My fiance first had to wander around and ask them if they were still serving food they were when we came in so we grabbed a seat at the bar It was a pretty quiet night honestly and it took the bartender close to 20 minutes to even acknowledge us When he finally did we ordered a bottle of wine which he seemed clueless about I thought maybe he just didnt hear us so I repeated myself a few times and finally had to point it out on the menu before he knew which one we were speaking about he also mispronounced rieslingwhich I realize is a bit nitpicky but if you work in a bar you should be able to accurately identify something as basic as that We also mentioned that we were wanting to order food as well The bartender came back with out bottle charged us for it then told us that the kitchen had just closed If wed have been served when we came in wed have been able to get some dinner I realize this may be a fault of our own but I find it a bit dubious that it wasnt said before he gave us our drinks That said the wine was over chilled and not very good and we ended up leaving most of it behind to go somewhere else I dont think Id ever return her just because of the service alone but it gets an extra star for the nice atmosphereIve just checked out the pictures of this place which make it look halfway cool  Its not  Yesterday The Man asked me what I wanted to do for the day because two of the three houses we were supposed to view are now under offer sadface  I responded get drunk  He laughed and asked me again and got the same answer  This house hunting business is stressful you know  So about late afternoon time we took a walk down the canal to Leith  We wandered around a bit because The Man wanted to go somewhere new and we ended up on Constitution St which has a few places which looked goodWe started in The Constitution Bar and the minute we walked in we knew it wasnt for us  The Man described it as soulless and I thought it looked like an upmarket canteen  The dining area actually had nice dark wood tables and chairs which if they were in the main room would make the place look a bit more interesting than the sterile blonde wood does  They were playing football through some dodgy probably illegal foreign channel which had drawn a few people in but the minute the football was over the majority of people left for more interesting pasturesThere is nothing actually wrong with this place the staff werent rude and the beer wasnt off it just wasnt an enjoyable place for a pint and I would definitely not go backKind of a strange big pub very clean and Tidy and nothing really that I could say was wrong with it Food was good and beer was fine It all just lacked a bit of depth bit like a window display The place is sectioned into a room through the back with a few tables a main pub room and a dining room We chose to eat in the pub area which was showing a footie game on a huge screen Reasonable bill at the end of it all Id probably pop in again if I was in the area and wanted a safe bet In saying that there were a couple of other places nearby that looked worth a visitThese guys were already pretty good in the burger field but they have recently introduced a revised burger menu And that thing is not to be sniffed atSystematically working my way through I can recommend the followingWELL BE JAMMINChilli jam cheddar lime chutney  pickled gingerPossibly the best of what Ive tried The pickled toppings add a fantastic zing to a very different burgerTEXMEXCajun coated chicken breast with sour cream jalapenos  cheddarSecond best chicken burger I ever had right behind Burgers chicken katsuWILD SIDEGame mince patty with apple crisps pulled pork crackling  smoked baconOne I had was a little dry but thats game Would go again make sure it wasnt a flukeThree down twelve to goOh another thing add them to your glutenfree things If thats your dealGood bar to chill out with a burger and a laptop and catch a football game while you bash out a cheeky blog post Chilled Out"

    "review":"Reekies is good BBQ Recently I had the pleasure of enjoying some of Reekies food when some friends picked up a little of everything and brought it back to our flat to enjoy one evening We had ribs pulled pork coleslaw BBQ beans and seasoned chipsThe ribs were good I would say the best Ive had in the UK so far They were slightly overcooked and so they felt a bit dry to me despite the BBQ sauce But they were overall pretty good in my opinion I really enjoyed the BBQ baked beans They were in a thick sauce and cooked well They had a nice spiciness to them that I also enjoyed with chunks of tomatoes in them as well The pulled pork was also good as well cooked perfectly and tender The group really enjoyed eating that The seasoned chips were also great one of my favourites from the nights meal  In the end I would eat at Reekies again possibly inside the restaurant next time The atmosphere in the place seems pretty cool and hipster The prices would definitely make it a once in a while thing to do but the food is definitely worth itWe wanted to have a great final meal on our last day in Edinburgh so we decided to stop off here on our way to the train station Food tasted great and the service was wonderful Thought it was a smidge overpriced but delicious nonetheless The baby back pork ribs did indeed fall off the bone and the beans had a nice kick to em A nice little selection of local beers as wellGreat place to go for Baby Back pork ribs and chips Ribs are really delicious and chips are melting in the mouth If I lived in Edinburgh I would probably pay a frequent visit to ReekiesThey offer a good variety of meats from pulled pork to steaks and different sauces I went for half rack of ribs grilled with Irn Bru Bbq sauce and their special hand cut rooster potatoes with meat dustThe place has a self service therefore be ready to order at the counter and choose your seat The staff is friendly and will advise you the best beer to your taste  I was pleased with the recommendation of Post Modern Classic Punk IPA from BrewdogIts interesting to note the smokehouse is student and kid friendly offering a student discount  on Tuesdays and boasts a cool corner for the kids where they can color a pig or a bull to their taste and stick it on the wallExcellent food at a good price Friendly staff and a good beer list Couldnt ask for much more The pork was a tad dry but the Irn Bru BBQ sauce fixed that House made ketchup was phenomenal and was great on our rosemary chips Well definitely be backStopped by Reekies to take away some dinner because all of the other restaurants were full for New Years Eve dinners The ribs and burnt ends were deliciousThis establishment prides itself in making great bbq meat  I have tried the full rack of ribs beef brisket the burnt ends and the chips  I think it is a good selection to find out what the quality of the meat is like for a bbq establishment  Unfortunately the meat here does not live up to my standard  The beef brisket and the ribs were slightly overcooked and on the dry side  The ribs seemed to have been cooked and left out for a long time before reheating up  Certainly were not falloffthebone I expect from ribs  The burnt ends I felt was the only most decent food here probably because the meat were made juicer by the fatty part of the meat  However the portion was just too small in what I describe as a paper cup for 950  The chips here used to be one of the best in Edinburgh and dusted in your choice of dust seasoning  They were definitely cooked twice  thrice and achieved maximum crispiness with its dark brown colour  I am unsure what happened after half a year or so and they have changed the way they cooked the chips and it has gone just mediocre  Unsure if I will come back but they really do need to look at the way they cook the meat to stay in the game  Even Hard Rock Cafes which I seldom go has better fallofthebone ribs  The previous owners of the restaurants in the same spot basically left after a short stint due to location  etc  They really do need to up their ante to attract more bbq meat lovers  Pity though as the owner are really friendly and the have a decent system in clearing up your own mess"

    "review":"Most magical place in Edinburgh to chill out post strolling around town Fantastic service unique ambience and super happy  knowledgable staff We were there late in the afternoon so the place wasnt too busy The bar is unique and beautiful This isnt a review for the bar We sat upstairs near the exterior patio had a nice view of the outside Our waiter was super nice and helpful He recommended the worlds best cocktails We had a few drinks my favorite was the one with vodka strawberry shrub and prosecco and all of them were perfectly crafted We each ordered a salad not the crappy house salad but the most scrumptious plate of greens greatness weve ever tasted  rare roast beef blushed sherry tomatoes soft boiled egg crispy onions sherry  nigella and shaved parmesan Im drooling just thinking about it Wish I had taken better photo of it if I had known it was going to be the best plate of saladever My sidekick ordered the crispy black pudding and blue murder salad We tried black pudding all over town including Ireland The Stornoway product they used there was the best We shared a plate of their chicken marinated with North African spices It has pomegranate bulgar wheat rose harissa pumpkin seeds and top with mint yoghurt While it was delicious THE salad took front and center stage We chatted with our server for a long time about living in Edinburgh and places to eat and he was extremely generous with his knowledge of the city and even look up the address of another restaurant for us to try We love this place and look forward to returning on our next trip to EdinburghUnfortunately we were not able to get in for dinner as they book up days in advance but stopped in for a couple drinks The atmosphere and decor is simply amazing It feels like youve stepped back in time a couple hundred years Also the cocktails are divine Try the Rose on St James We will definitely be back for dinner next time we are in EdinburghI love this venue Its got an imaginative cocktail selection with a few old favourites contrasted with other bizarre concoctions  as any decent cocktail bar should The wine selection is also fantastic  the gent serving us obliged us with some small tasters in advance of our final choice I have not yet had anything that constitutes even the slightest bit of bad service  therefore continue to return to this favourite spot frequently Id put this forward as a cosy spot for the winter seasonAn unexpected turn led us towards The Devils Advocate Im glad it didA great location and venue The food was fantastic Especially the Haggis bonbons that everyone has mentionedThe staff were all very good Quite attentive and helpful Especially the super cute redhead waitress from Winnipeg of all placesGo here you wont be disappointedIf you like an aromatic cocktail you cannot go wrong with the BV Sazerac  old school deliciousFood was very good and well be backCame here for after dinner drinks read: scotch  The whiskey list here is impressive some 810 pages of whiskeys from all over the world  The atmosphere is very unique dark and old feeling in a good way"

    "review":"This place was absolutely great  The food was awesome both times we went there and the beer was some of the best we had on our trip The only issue we had was that it was closed twice when their business hours said open We were sad we couldnt eat there againJust outside Royal mile  Great food  Service was a little slow I guess you could blame it on a shift change  Had the haggis turnip and mash and it was delicious  Wife had the Prince Charles chicken and mash and it was good as well  Would definitely visit again if we lived hereI ate here in July when some friends were visiting from the US and I wanted them to try haggis We had their two course lunch meal I think it was 15 pp and a nice glass of prosecco with strawberry puree We started with smoked salmon and then had their version of haggis neeps and tatties for the main which was really delicious The haggis was not overpowering and it was extremely high quality The restaurant has a nice vibe casual but upscale enough for a special lunch andor dinner I will definitely be backI intended to have a late lunchearly dinner on my way to the train station But sadly this was not to be When I arrived at 15:30 I was informed that they were only serving desserts and drinks As I was tired and hungry I opted for the sticky toffee pudding and a black coffee The coffee was lovely the pudding was okay except it wasnt very warm  I prefer my ice cream to melt on top Whilst dining I checked the venue website and couldnt find any times for lunch and dinner menus As if Id known that hot food wasnt served for a couple of hours I could have planned my trip differentlyWhere do I begin Super friendly staff great menu and the food was fabulous We recommend the lamb shank and Bonnie Prince Charlie chicken My husband went for the Hagis  and turnips and raved about it  We were surprised with the ample servings based on the pricesvery ample Save room for dessert because the sticky toffee pudding is marvelousThis is a nice Scottish sit down restaurant with a few items on a lunch menu ranging 810 and a full bar with local specialty beers I have been here a few times having a steak sandwich very nice though slightly tough and small for the American palate neaps and haggis good if you like haggis and stokkie This has become a regular for nicer business lunch Just recently had the stokkie and was pleasantly surprised Basically a soupy dish with potatoes cabbage and savory ham hock and topped with a few slivers of steak Very nice and something Id come back again for especially good for Scottish weather"

    "review":"Yet ANOTHER Italian restaurant on Antigua Street It really amazes meThis restaurant fittingly family owned and overwhelmingly Italian is one of many of its kind in the area surrounding the Playhouse They take advantage of this and have a special pretheatre menu which I have to say is extremely reasonably priced The starters pizzas and pasta dishes are quite similar to those on their regular menu although you wont find their fish dishes on this menuI would definitely recommend saving yourself for the desserts as every one of them is so tempting I joined some friends there after their main meal and the tiramisu I had was absolutely foodgasmicThis is a pretty good restaurant and would recommend it if you want a decent meal before heading to the Playhouse I came here with a couple of friends before watching a movie in the omnicentre just down the road I ordered the Pizza Mamma Roma which came with asparagus cheese and ham I thought that the food tasted pretty bland but the prices are reasonable and you do get good portions of food to ensure a full tummyThere are a huge amount of dishes on offer at Mamma Roma and me and my friends only ordered pizzas there so perhaps their food has more flavour in some of the other dishesThe decor is pretty nice but is tainted by the fact that they seem to be playing up to the stereotypical Italian features and gives the place a cheesy feel to itOrdered pasta with mushrooms asparagus and a cream sauce for takeaway last night Thats exactly what I gotno salt pepper or any herbsspicescheese The worst part was that the asparagus and mushrooms were canned"

    "review":"The restaurant at The Bonham inhabits some really classic and traditional West End space at Drumsheugh Gardens Most of the properties here form part of big imposing buildings with dramatic front doors and windows The restaurant at The Bonham is part of the four star Bonham hotel which is really beautiful insideI came here for lunch with the family and although it wasnt super busy with only what looked like a few business lunches on the go the atmosphere was still great and felt very elegant spacious and refined Despite the menu and some of the decor having a modern edge to it the actual dining space still feels quite formal and traditional but I like a bit of a tradition so that suits me You can get some pretty good set menu lunch deals here and its a nice change to come to this part of the west end rather than just opting for right in the centre of town all the time Maybe not the place for a big raucous party dinner but great for more of a classy you can safely take the parents here eventWe went there based on Yelps reviews because we were staying across the road at a beautiful luxury holiday apartment The food was good not cheap but ridiculously small portions Like they served at the height of the silly nouvelle cuisine movement in the early 90sI had a good hamburger down the road at Wannaburgers afterwards and I am not a big eater We were served good sized portions at all the other Edinburgh restaurants we went to while staying thereWe visited during the week on a Wednesday The Hotel and Restaurant are easy to find The restaurant is a large spacious area It could easily double up as a decent ballroom On arrival we guided to our table and our coats were taken As we were on a voucher the particulars were explained to us and they supplied a menu for us to look over if we wanted some starters We took on the offer and ordered Roe Deer Carpaccio and a couple of champagne kir aperitifs The kirs were decent not outstandingly nice but having some interesting taste The Roe Deer was served with what can only describe as breaded haggis balls  quite tasty The main was a steak chateaubriand cooked medium rare and served with a very nice jus We had some chunky chips and peppery rocket salad leafs Very well executed and great flavour The 2008 Rioja was a welcome wine accompaniment The service was efficient friendly non intrusive and discreet We shall certainly return at some pointClassic hotel restaurant decor walking in you expect this to be a great experience But  reality proved different Unattentive service chaotic staff Ordered a glass of wine it did not show up until I asked when it would be served then it came five seconds before the food arrived The food was good at least mine but my companion said hers was tepid Atmosphere was 8 food 7 service 2  Ask for check and they had to re do it as the left off some items Then we had to hunt for my wifes coatI had heard good things so when I saw they were running a deal on toptable I was excited to finally check this place outSadly I was nothing but underwhelmed The food was nothing spectacular the service was about the same they completely forgot about our side of vegetables and when we asked they came up with some poor excuse before producing a plate of pretty sad looking veg The entire experience was just lacklustreWith so many other options around town I wont be hurrying backTop quality locally sourced produce turned into beautifully executed dishes The Boozy Snoozy is a fabulous deal on Thursday evenings and SaturdaySunday lunchtime We summed it up: The Bonham has shown itself to be an excellent venue consistently producing dishes of true imagination boldness and balance Its another gem of the West End and one you should consider visiting at your earliest convenience"

    "review":"Lovely food and relaxed atmosphere  we will definitely be back We went for a last minute Friday dinner out It was quiet when we arrived but soon filled up We both had sirloin steaks with pepper sauce which were delicious Then we couldnt decide about dessert so shared a portion of the warm brownies with ice cream which they helpfully made up into a sharing portion Friendly and relaxing with great food  perfect for a low key dinner with friendsLooking for a pretheatre meal  having heard and read good reports I was looking forward to visiting this diner Im afraid I was very disappointed from the lingering smell of cooking oil to the artificial foliage the slightly irritating buzzhum of something electrical every few seconds and very tired decor the meal had a lot of impressing to do to make up My friend had a ribeye steak which looked really good but was served up with an apologetic few sprigs of salad and uninspiring coleslaw My BBQ chicken melt was tender but overwhelmed with artificial sauce and the same saladcoleslaw rations I chose boiled baby potatoes instead of chips they were over cooked and might even have been reheated  something distinctly odd Id abandoned my glass of white wine by this point The pudding menu suggested homely American desserts My apple crumble with custard was a gloopy probably microwaved ensemble without any crumbliness to the topping It was just soggy and the custard had a skin on it  Its such a shame as I get the feeling this used to be a nice wee spot Theres a fine line between unfussy homely ambience and cooking and tired surroundings with decent food spoiled by bought inready made garnishes  Sadly tonight this place just wasnt up to scratchI discovered many little gems during my short stint of living in Bruntsfield and this fantastic diner owned by a couple was one of themYou wont miss the traditional diner sign hanging outside the restaurant and the food is just as wholesome as youd expect a place like this to be The starters are quite wonderful on their own which include cheese filled jalapenos and garlic mushrooms and Id be tempted to make a meal out of one them and the devilish desserts Like most diners this place isnt too concerned with watching calories and after your meal youve got the option of having banoffee shortcake pecan pie and sticky toffee pudding to top things offAnd finally I get to the main dishes which Ive saved for last Firstly because they can be a little pricey for what youd expect at a diner the fillet of steak is over 20 and there is no burger that costs less than 8 And secondly because therere so many great options I feel like eating my way through the whole menu Katies prides themselves on using fresh Scottish beef and ALOT of it and the steaks and many burgers as well as salads come in all sorts of flavours my favourite being the garlicky chicken salad and the good ol BBQ burgerIve always gravitated more towards these places where one can get wholesome meals rather than the 2 pieces of designer potatoes and a strategically placed leaf restaurants so Katies certainly does it for meMy first dinner in Edinburgh and one of the best meal I hadKaties Diner was one of the highest selections of my long long list of places I wished to try to get a mealAfter reading the few reviews on Yelp I was almost sure that I would have liked itA wee cosy relaxing nice place with a warm atmosphere granted by the welcoming owner and also by the customers I would say All this I was expecting and I found it all in an early Thursday eveningMoreover the wonderful view across the Meadows reaching Arthurs Seat on the other side was a plus that I enjoyed in a very special way on entering the DinerThe sirloin was really good I asked for a mediumrare cooking and it was perfectly done The salad was fresh and tasty as wellA very nice time spent in a very nice place I went away with the feeling that nothing could have gone in a better wayJust went tonight after another local restaurants menu didnt appeal and have fancied going to Katies for a while now The burgers were topnotch the chicken looked fantastic and my friend said her steak was one of the best shes had in ages We were all too stuffed for pudding afterwardsThe only reason Im not giving a full 5 stars is because the menu seems slightly limited especially with regards to starters However although they dont have the BIGGEST selection around they certainly do have one of the BESTI somehow get the feeling Ill be backrepeatedlyA recent voucher deal didnt quite turn out the way it was supposed to as the restaurant had unexpectedly closed down I didnt have a plan B in mind so it was time to wander round the area and look for other optionsKaties Diner came to rescue I have always wanted to try this place out as it seems to have good reviews so this was a good opportunityThe restaurant had no other diners when we came in but filled up eventually We were greeted warmly by the owner who gave the menus and took our drink orders I had a glass of house red and it was a very reasonable 295 for a small 175ml glass The wine was ok not great but not bad either :  I now know that they do BYOB as well which I might consider next time when I visit this establishment there will be a next time definitelyI shared a starter of jalapeno peppers stuffed with cream cheese and coated with breadcrumbs They came with a little pot of chilli sauce The peppers were very tasty a nice start for the dinner Oooh and the chicken I was so happy I went with my choice of Hawaiian chicken which was a chargrilled chicken breast with a chargrilled pineapple ring on top It came with salad coleslaw and chips The chicken was absolutely delicious  a really good charcoal flavour and well on taste The chips however were just ok I loved the simple but delicious home cooked food at Katies Diner The atmosphere was also very relaxing and the owner Jeff was very welcoming and friendlySome reviews mention the decor as being outdated and perhaps it is  but I think in a way it just adds up to this places own character I personally am not that bothered by the decor as long as the food delivers and here it certainly does"

    "review":"Bella Italia seem to have been around for eternity While more modern twists have been applied to the Italian restaurant Bella has simply stuck to its original briefExpect all the usual Italian fare and with a standard level of polish They often do a pizzawine combo which is always there to coax the punters in but its just not an establishment that tempts me over the likes of Pizza ExpressThis particular branch seems to be too busy most of the time and thus I often wander straight pastThe other worldly pleasure that is a meal at Bella ItaliaIve eaten here quite a few times and for an extremely busy restaurant which also happens to be a chain Im repeatedly surprised by the quality of the foodBella Italia has two branches in Edinburgh one at Northbridge and my personal favourite at Hanover Technically theres no noticeable difference between the two branches Id even say the one at Northbridge looks nicer  and has some pleasant outdoor seating for those few and cherished days when the sun shines in Edinburgh jokes jokesFor some reason Ive repeatedly trekked all the way to Princes street turned on to Hanover and treated myself to the greatest pizzas and desserts Ive eaten here because I was bored for a break from shopping and then for my 19th birthday dinner Service is great and on one occasion my pizza was diligently replaced after Id devoured half of it when the waitress realized an ingredient was missing from my order More pizza for me so I wasnt complainingI would definitely recommend Bella for just about every dining occasion dinner with friends a large group a date and theyre also very affordable The banoffee pie should not go untasted As Ive written this Im quite tempted to head back real soon I even managed to score a free umbrella from a member of staff last December so I definitely feel appreciated as wellStopped in for a late lunch after a morning of sightseeing  It was an odd hour for lunch 2:30 but the service was good  Food was ok not the greatest Italian Ive ever had but hot and it came fast and was served with a smile and reasonably priced so I cant complainIn need of a quick bite to eat and a glass of wine on Hanover St my friend and I stopped by Bella Italia We only had an hour and thankfully didnt have to wait too long before being seated Probably due to not have a reservation we had the furthest away possible table upstairs next to the toilets wooI ordered Pollo alla Crema having had it a few years before and remembering it to be pretty tasty It wasnt great the pasta in particular but edible and I was really hungry My friends bruschetta looked good though and a very geneous portion The wines by the glass arent cheap but the house white I had was perfectly okayThe service was good though or at least it was quick We were in a hurry but luckily didnt have to wait too long to be served or for foodI wouldnt recommend Bella Italia its chain dining at its most mediocre but its serviceableNot great  Had the low cal pizza which was basically a pita bread with a couple of mozzerella cheese balls on top  My friend had pasta again just ok  A tourist destination filled with screaming kids at lunch timeWanted to try Italian when in Edinburgh In fact my wife was more keen for it Bella Italia has a good reputation so was our first choice Choose the Royal Mile branch and went in with my family including my 1 yr old kid After ordering had to wait for almost 1 hour to get our food as it seems the kitchen had collapsed due to untimely exit of the chef for some personal problems Thats fine as it can happen to anyone The only reason I am giving this low score is cause we were not informed about this and they kept us waiting And one can understand to wait so long with a 1 yr kid  It was almost 1 hr after we came to know and the manager was no where to be seen Food was good and can give 3 star for that But not pleased at all with service Next time if I ever go will ask waiting time first and then order I never expect this from such a reputed restaurant No one would I assume"

    "review":"Wonderfully humble cheap Mexican for the localsGreat burritos at decent prices  Ive had the chicken and beef burritos there and enjoyed them They come heaped with fillings and pack a good hit of spice  Really enjoyed both visits but its basically just a takeaway so dont expect anything fancyGreat burrito place for a nice lunch break this place is more for takeout as there is not much sitting space but the burritos a big tasty and cheap Perfect combination it can get very crowded around lunch hour but never crazy enough that it would have changed my mind lunch deal involves a small not that small burrito and a drink for 5 which i think is a great dealPopped into here as wanted something quick and to try something new The girl behind the counter was lovely and much like the idea of Chipolte  you pick what you would like and then add in the toppings I opted for a small vegetarian burrito with rice and beans and my partner got the beef burrito The large is enormous so happy I got the small The toppings you can add include  jalapenos cheese pico de gallo sour cream lettuce guacomle for 50 extra and some hot sauces I opted for medium and it was spice enough We also both asked for everything and were truly wondering if the lovely girl helping us could fold the burrito  as it was rammed full Amazingly she managed to wrap it and put it on the grill for a few minutes they offer a small burrito and a soda for 5 so our meal was 10 for the two of us It was hard to eat only because it was so massive  it was tasty and fresh  my only gripe being  the toppings werent evenly spread through so at some stages I have salsa and at others sour cream But it tasted nice and was a good deal with good serviceJust to note  they only have a table with 6 seats at it for community style eating if you opt to stay in so best to takeaway as there might not be spaceI wish I could give it 35 stars it wasnt exactly the Mexican spices I would expect but the service was nice and fast and the food fresh and tastyBest Mexican street food at Edinburgh We found this by accident during the rain and ordered nachos quesadilla and soft shell tacos all with pull pork they had chicken beef and vegetarian as well It was so good So we decided to come here again the next day with double the portion So yummyLet me clear something up straight away Taquito is more of a Taco Bell rather than being Edinburghs answer to Chipotle or Moes Now that thats out of the way I stopped in here for a quick bite at a cheap price and thats exactly what I got For just under 4 I had a decent chicken burrito and a canned fizzy drink The burrito was good for Scotland standards While the chicken and rice were great it could use some improvement on having more fresh ingredients For example Im pretty sure the jalapeos chills were the kind from a jar which is odd because I think fresh ones are actually cheaper than buying them in the jar Also I didnt notice much if any cilantro coriander which is one of the things that usually sticks out to me when I have fresh Mexican or southwest food At any rate I would by no means be planning to compare it with a burrito you might pick up in Mexico or the USA The service had much to be desired but I must remind you that the window says Mexican Street Food Taquito reminds me a lot of a taco truck that might be parked on the side of the street and with that in mind the service is quite similar They take your order eventually ask for your money which could be a few minutes later and not really much to say other than that its actually a bit confusing when it comes to figuring out where to queue to order and also to wait for your order so if its a bit awkward youre not the only one There really isnt much seating Its not the place for planning to sit down and enjoy a meal with friends The seating suggests exactly what I believe is intended either youre eating quick and then on your way or your getting it takeaway I was on my own and just wanted a quick lunch so Taquito was perfect You may be wondering with my review why Ive given it 4 stars The reason for this is that you can be out the door for less 350400 and when I compare that to what I could get elsewhere for the same price it really cant be beat Until Chipotle breaks out of London and cuts their price in half Im happy to go to Taquito"

    "review":"I stumbled upon My Big Fat Greek Kitchen completely by chance several months ago and I was a bit unsure about eating here as I thought the name was a bit cheesy but I was so wrong as I had a really tasty meal here Situated in the Toll cross area of Edinburgh this restaurant is just a short walk from the city centre so it is a convenient place to reach The menu offers a vast range of authentic Greek cuisine including hummus tzatziki and olives I had a selection of dips for a starter which was really gorgeous followed by a chicken kebab for my main which was tasty and served with chips but not just as good as the starter The dishes are very reasonable here with a two course meal costing around seven pounds and the portions were a decent size too My Big Fat Greek Kitchen offer baklava for desert which I absolutely love and their version was really lovely but so sweet The only thing which I felt let the meal down were the waiters who I felt were quite rude and generally disinterested in the customers I had a really delicious meal here and would like to go back but the service I experienced put me off so it will probably be a while before Im back in this restaurantFrom the name youd expect this Tollcross restaurant to offer some kind of fullon Greek cultural experience where waiters speak with exaggerated accents flamboyantly smash plates and generally play up to every national stereotype out there  However to my slight relief when I came here with some friends I found the atmosphere considerably more restrained  in fact we were the only people in the restaurant probably because we were there early on a week nightFortunately the isolation didnt stop us from enjoying the perfectly cooked food  The menu contains no surprises featuring typical Greek dishes such as Moussaka and Pork Souvlaki but our meal proved theres nothing wrong with keeping things traditional as everything was excellent especially the starters  What particularly stood out for me was the spanakopita feta and spiach pacrels which had this amazing crispiness that is never there when I cook them myself  The service was also really good as youd expect given there was nobody else thereFrom Fiona Hs review I get the impression My Big Fat Greek Kitchen gets considerably more lively at weekends  Perhaps thats when they do all the plate smashingI love Greek food so much its got to the stage that a glimpse of the flag makes me hungry Id eat it if I could So when I saw the white and baby blue colour scheme of this place my stomach rumbledServing up my favourites as well as some interesting dips I hadnt tried before I was impressed by My Big Fat Greek Kitchen I visited here with the more adventurous eaters in my family and we tucked into hearty portions of food The restaurant staff are friendly and the decor is kept simple so youre not distracted by over the top surroundingsWe left feeling full but not bloated and had a lovely evening I got the whitebait and mousakka which seems to be a recurring theme with me but it makes me a good judge of when a portion is tasty It was and would try and branch out next time although I tried an awesome dip  cant remember the name of it but it was out of this worldI dislike the film that this restaurant borrows its title from but I love this place This Greek Kitchen would make me fat if I stayed near it since I would visit frequently Its been a few months since I was here last but I am in danger of catching a train tomorrow morning if I continue to talk about it So hungry God DamnIve been here a few times with friends always really love everything we order I usually go for 23 small plates instead of a big main though Ive been told that the mains are excellent as well Great atmosphere for medium sized groups smallish so not too loud staff are always very friendlyFavorites: Spanakopita feta parcels grilled halloumi courgette fritters Also wineI lived in Greece for a couple of years and go there every year on holiday almost only because I absolutely love the food This place had a good atmosphere the food was pretty authentic and quite tasty but as a huge mezze fan I was disappointed that the mezzes cost quite a lot for the portion sizesI will definitely go again maybe in a bigger group so as to split the price of lots of yummy mezzesLOVE I LOVE this place The servers went above  beyond their call of duty and made us feel like we were at home This place caters to people and listens and wants to please The food is also very good To be honest I was so overwhelmed by the service I just thought everything was lovely I will definitely go again and pay more attention specifically to the food but I know I liked what I ate They even let me change my lunch special to suit my every whim I had a hankering for a gyro and the cook was nice enough to make one for me and not charge me anything extraIts not everyday you do out to eat and have such a pleasant experience that you almost feel bad leaving because you love everyone around you so much  Will definitely be going back and recommending this place"

    "review":"Well this was disappointing Our second visit to thaisanuk we had intended to order green curry and pad thai both with tofu but surprisingly they had run out of tofu so we ordered both these dishes with vegetables instead priced the same as with prawns chicken or beef The dishes arrived with a few slivers of vegetables floating in the curry and none noticeable in the pad thaiWe spoke to the waitress about the lack of vegetables especially given the price relative to other dishes She went away to talk to the chef and phoned the manager and came back with an offer to remake the dishes with more vegetables Whilst this might have been acceptable the process had taken so much time that we had almost finished the wine and we were not in the mood to reset and start the meal again So instead we offered to pay for one main course which seemed reasonable given the lack of the central ingredient There followed an indirect conversation with the manager relayed by the waitress which ended with the comment from the manager that we would write a poor review and not return anyway so we should just pay what we wantedThe food had great flavour but the bottom line for vegetarians is it is inadequate Basically the dishes serves are the standard base without the addition of any meat or tofu but at the same price The manager was very disconnected from the situation and unwilling to make things right by a small gesture The waitress did well though despite the lack of support from her bossA shame the food has potential but issues with how the restaurant is runIf I could give 0 stars I wouldI have never had to leave a restaurant half way thru dining because the food is so bad before but that is exactly what happened here tonight The food was dreadful Really poor quality Felt like they just didnt care what they served up to us I imagine they had been to the Chinese supermarket and got some sauce packets then went to Sainsburys and got some egg noodles mixed them together and served OK yes there was some chicken which I suppose there was not much wrong with but the veg were inexcusable Giant chunks of boiled onion and big chunks of raw tomato have no place in a good Laksa Youve got to really be doing something wrong when the food is managing to be both tasteless and spicy Avoid at all costs There are plenty of very good Thai places in Edinburgh this place really needs to step it up They would benefit from a trip to Celadon if they want to see how to do it rightI think Aok summs this up as far as delivered Thai food goesTuesdayThursday they have an offer of Starter main and a side for 10 free delivery so last night Mrs and thought Life of Pi and a Thai had to be good as it rhymedI went for the fish cakes and the garlic  pepper chicken with noodles Mrs had chicken skewers with Prawn Thai Green Curry I for sure got the better side of this dealStephs curry was watery the prawns overcooked and the rice ok my fish cakes with dipping sauce were acceptable and my chicken was succulent and had a good hit of taste noodles were I have to say very tastyI guess Aok is really for my meal Mrs would probably say she has had better All in all if you want a cheap meal its not bad but if you are looking for something really great as ever you will have to go elsewhere and pay for it it was half the price of the take away we had from Ruan Thai and probably as good so take from that what you willLoved this place when it was up Marchmont way  Felt a bit like eating exotic food in your grans front room and you could sup on a mighty fine wine without busting the bank thanks to the BYOB arrangement   Somewhere in the transition to the new locale its lost a bit of its quirkiness and I think thats a real shame Its still BYOB which isnt a bad thing as the soft drinks on offer are pretty pricey  The food is decent   the Laksas fragrant and cooked to order in terms of heat and the Vietnamese Pho noodles are a real winner  Sadly as a sit in eatery its just lacking in any atmosphere which is probably why on a Friday evening at 8pm we were the only people left  There was a bit more activity on the takeaway side and I really hope this part of the business takes offHave to say the young woman working here was lovely and and I felt sorry she wasnt kept a bit busier if only for the opportunity of more tips Definitely be back but carry out option only I thinkOrdered food from here for dinner tonight Well impressed Delivery is free when you spend over a tenner always a nice bonusPad thai was yummy and they didnt skimp on the prawns Malaysian curry went down a treat grapes and pineapples adds a slight sweetness to the curry which is great for the mister who isnt always so keen on spicy food Massaman curry went down a treat something slightly different to the green curry I normally order Both currys had plenty of protein chicken for him beef for me  The vietnamese chicken wings were yummy as well Would definitely get food from here again"

    "review":"I have recently been slightly obsessed with the idea of dairyfree and vegan alcoholic milkshakes  so when I read that Burger not only do dairyfree milkshakes with soy milk and sorbets  but they also can put in alcohol too  I had to visit asap I emailed the day before to double check vegan options from the menu  and if we were allowed to bring our own unopened pack of cheese for the burger and the curry poutine I received an email back with a very helpful outline of the regular menu items and the specials which could be veganised This included the veggie burger a patty made with beetroot  quinoa  and tempeh  and the veggie dog  and veggie chilli  with chilli sauce or chipotle and lime sauce not the burger sauce as it contains egg  You have the option of paying 35p for a dairyfree bun  but it isnt vegan as it contains egg We could bring our own vegan cheese and also our own buns When I replied back and happened to mention that I was looking forward to trying their alcoholic milkshakes she offered suggestions of ingredient combinations  and also to bring coconut  apple  and mango sorbets from their Shandwick Place branch across for us as the Fountainbridge branch only had pineapple We bought some Violife from Real Foods and some burger buns from a nearby Sainsburys  and when we arrived we had absolutely fantastic service in going through our food and drink options note: we had made reservations so they knew when to expect us  We couldnt have had better service The only niggle really was having to provide our own buns problems with sourcing vegan rolls seems to be quite commonplace  made especially difficult with the popularity of places these days to use brioche buns For dairy cheese you have to pay extra anyway  and some places dont even allow you to bring your own dairyfree version so that wasnt a big deal  The burger was good  I was so excited to have an oozy cheeseburger I cant really comment much more as I pretty much inhaled it and didnt stop to consider other flavours  Also  as wed gotten the poutine with flavoursome curry sauce my normal chipdar didnt really kick in The cheese didnt melt in as well as it had done in the burger but we enjoyed it nevertheless For the soy milk based drinks we got one apple sorbet  vodka  and caramel milkshake which delicious Very appley The other was Havana rum  coconut sorbet  Oreos accidentally vegan  may contain milk traces  and honeycomb The staff member who brought it over was a bit concerned at the perhaps unappetising greenybrown colour of its combination and brought us over a complimentary mango sorbet  peach schnapps mix but as a former Vitamix owner who has created all sorts of coloured combination of drinks  I was keen to keep my Oreo drink of heaven It was absolutely delicious  the colour didnt put me off at all The gray decor of the place isnt that appealing  which is a shame as some colour would create a more pleasant environment  in my opinion Its a great place to go for an informal bite to eat before a gig  or drinks and snacks after work  but I would likely go elsewhere for a special occasion  For me the food menu is fairly average  but the drinks and service are superb and if I was looking for a place to go with friends for a quick bite I would definitely go backAtmosphere is a bit lacking so far although I was in on their opening day so cant really fault them too much Burger was solid fries were a touch cold but still tasty beer was boring I need to go back and investigate more thoroughly and hungrilySo I ended up here totally by accident I was popping into Loudons for a coffee and suddenly realised I was standing right outside Burger So many people had said very excited things about this place so the coffee stop quickly turned into a lunch stopI came with my buddy Daniel and we were both a little too taken in by the girl serving us We were charmedconned into getting chips then upgraded to chilli chips and i was also convinced to get peanut butter added to my vanilla milkshake Dont get me wrong we welcomed all these additions We didnt realise that chilli chips actually came with a load of DELICIOUS chilli on them thank god Stevie was there to help outI opted for a double burger with bacon Extremely tasty burger although the bacon was  that chewy stringy crap a timely reminder to why i never get bacon on my burgers The beef was delicious with just the right amount of toppings and bun that held its structure until the end of the burgerI think however the Milkshake was the highlight for me You can tell an awful lot about a place by its milkshakes These were thick and creamy and ever so delicious and not hideously overpriced The peanut butter was a very good option to have with the vanilla shake Frankly I might pop in here for milkshakes aloneI didnt take in the menu to its fullest but Im definitely going to go and check it out again soonIve loved this place since day one and it had yet to disappoint Amazing burgers the specials are always very inventive and the staff are great Theyve really nailed high quality fast food and is expect them to expand way beyond their two units based on the quality of the experience they offerGenuinely surprised at the taste and quality given the price The slaw is tangy and filling as was the classic Burger This is perfect for vegetarians There was great customer service which I hope doesnt dissappear when this place gets as popular as u expect it will when everyone finds outTheres no reason for me to give them less than 5 stars I had a bacon cheeseburger and fries and it was delicious The burger was messy but when it comes to burgers I think thats how they should be The fries were a perfect combination of crispy yet soft and I must say Im a fan Yummy meal for about 7 sounds good to me Right when I was starting to miss the burgers back home Just what I needed"

    "review":"Very nice little joint Nice atmosphere great tapas but needs a bit more greenery in the menu to add a bit of variety to proceedings Definitely worth a visit though if you need a Spanish fix4 stars maybe a little bit too high but hey ho I think they have the best tapas in town Mariscos y Pescados is my favourite menu section Great taste very light flavour Service is not bad and staff is friendly The only thing isI broke soap holder in the bathroom yes it was me and when I came back to the restaurant 5 days later it was still broken and exactly as I left it Maintenance team maybe need to check seoritas rest room more often Up until a few months ago my knowledge of tapas was all theoretical As part of one of the classes I was supporting in this year we were learning all about Spanish culture and food was a big part of the cultureAs a treat to the class we went on a field trip to Cafe Andaluz and we all tried two dishes each from the tapas menuUpon walking in you enter into a little corridor almost like walking into your parents house and we were very quickly greeted by a member of star and shown to our reserved table there were jugs of juices and water on the table within moments of us being seated and then we were given time to assess the menu And what a menu obviously it is all traditional Spanish cuisine and most of the young people went for the safe options such as the albondigas and the tortilla I was desperate to try good calamares and was not disappointed by them but the star of the show was my plate of ScallopsIve never eaten scallops before and so was not sure what was about to happen but from the first bite I knew I was on to a good thing up until this point we had all shared a little of each thing but the more expensive things were only eaten by the person who had put up the money for them to keep it fair and I have never been happier because I couldnt have shared my scallops even if Id wanted to Frankly three was not enoughThe only downside to the day was the fact that although we were in a Spanish restaurant we could not order in Spanish even though the young people tried really hard to do so The waiter serving us was French the other waiter was Italian I believe and then another waitress was another nationality It made for a fun conversation with each of them when our young people tried there hardest to talk to them in Spanish to be told I dont speak Spanish but I can speak English if that helps Such a good day and my only qualm is that I havent been back yet although this time I might just have to have a glass of wine with my mealMy second meal here a work Christmas night out was better than the first a Hogmanay special  they threw us out at 1030pm but only justThe food was variable dreadful beef ok duck nasty salsa with the sea bream and some divine Spanish equivalent of a Gratin Dauphinoise Puddings were equally up and down up for the chocolate delice very down down down for the butterscotch fat and sugarfest sorry cheesecakeTwo of the above three stars are for the staff: Rushed off their feet in a packed noisy restaurant they kept their good humour and gave us good serviceIf it werent for the food this would have been a 5 star night out Not what you really want from a restaurantCame here for our work Christmas night outWas an extremely busy Saturday night but the service was excellent Our food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious The scallops and prawns were my favourites Treated ourselves to dessert and it was definitely worth it Very rich chocolate and creamy cheesecake to choose from and both were tastyWe forgot to pick up our receipt for our expenses but when we phoned them the next day they could not have been nicer or more helpful The lady was friendly and got us a copy of the invoice no bother All in all a great experience and would return for sureVery busy tapas restaurant The food was very good My favorite dish was the fried chicken with honey It was perfectly sweet and salty Yum :"

    "review":"The burger is great with great meat and bunToo bad the meat is not chargrilled and pickles are too strongGreat place with good value in overpriced EdinburghCame in at peak time on a Saturday afternoon and I cant fault the service or the food I Opted for a pastrami cheesesteak sandwich instead of the usual burger choices which is adventurous for me Im not sure what a pastrami cheesesteak is supposed to taste like but this was delicious  so juicy and a perfect portion size The sandwiches probably get overlooked since the burgers are so great but Id thoroughly recommend my choiceWe had bacon chips as a side obviously and I had a coconut milkshake which you needThe burger itself was pretty bad but I dont blame the establishment   Current laws only allow for Well done burgers thus I received a hockey puck with cheese pickles and BBQ sauce  If you are an american you will not like burgers here  The fries Chips could have been fresher  The staff was very good thoughHad the animal poutine dish 2 burgers with special sauce and poutine Friend had a double cheeseburger For the minimal price difference I would say the poutine is significantly better value All very very tasty filling and made freshly to order We only waited 5 minutes for a table but the queue was huge by the time we left Very satisfied and would go again Only trouble is my farts were stinking the next day a beautiful reminder of a great mealI know people rave about this place so Im sure my review will not be well received Im sorry I didnt have the burgers for which they are so famously amazing We went for lunch yesterday Cheerful atmosphere Very busy We had to wait for a wee bit which was awkward as there were so many people waiting we were blocking the door They just dont have a lot of space of there are a few people waiting maybe 8 But things moved quickly so we didnt mind The servers were pretty friendly and we had maybe 4 different servers So Im not sure whether they are allocated tables or duties Leaving a tipnot sure who it goes to Firstly my boyfriend had the beef brisket which looked very yummy He later told me it was dry which is quite unfortunate Hes not overly picky and isnt one to complain so this says quite a bit For myself a native Canadian I obviously ordered the poutine My first one in 3 years a dish that I adore and rave about it to people who have never had it I was disappointed The only redeeming factor was the cheese curds Real cheese curds That was ace Other than that I had a a plate of gravy and soggy chips Too much gravy It was drowning in gravy That wouldnt be appetising to anyone So if someone whose never had poutine before tries it from Bread meats Bread I think they too would probably rate it average and not have it again It also seems to have been baked as the chips were baked to the bottom of the dish and my first bite was lukewarm Underneath was hot so perhaps it had been sitting under the warmer for a while Hence the super soggy chips Either way:its an easy dish to throw together its unnecessary for it to be baked or put under a warmer The construction of a poutine is simple chips pile of cheese curds and hot gravy over top Not so much that its drowning in gravy But enough HOT gravy to melt the cheese curds and puddle amongst the chips Some chips at the very bottom would eventually get a bit soggy but overall you should have plenty of crispy chips mopping up the gravy Ah Im ranting now I couldnt finish it and mentioned to the waitress clearing out plates that the poutine had too much gravy and she just said shed tell the chef Whatever that means We also had some onion rings which I cannot rate They were not to my liking The coleslaw was nice if not a bit too creamy for my liking And the medium glass of wine I ordered was very nice but over priced 5 All in all Ive given the place 3 stars as most people love this place on their experiences of fantastic burgers I would have given it 2 stars on my experience alone Im not sure I would go back Sorry lovers of Bread meats Breadbut lovers of poutine will be disappointedI am not sure why did this place get so many good reviews I ordered their signature pulled pork burger I think they call it Lothian and it was a disaster The beef was overload until I could barely eat it far passed well done Coming from the US I have seen a lot of bad burgers but never this bad in a place that is positioning itself as a burger place Stear clear"

    "review":"This is a hidden gem in an excellent location between Lothian Road and the Meadows Angelo not sure if Marcella is a surname or somebody elses name runs the place by himself so you might be waiting a while for your order depending on how busy it is but you wont be disappointed The food is authentic delicious and extremely good valueWe visited for a meal before a concert on Lothian Road and were one of only two couples at the place initially A much larger group arrived just as we finished so Im glad that timing worked outI wanted pasta so ordered a simple spaghetti bolognese Mary ordered a pizza with a variety of vegetables We brought our own bottle of wine after reading previous reviews that suggested free corkage BYOB is absolutely fine but the corkage is NOT free It cost 2 for the bottle of wine However its fine because the rest of the meal was very good value That said I am a little confused about the corkage cost because I did not see any alcohol for sale on the menuThe food when it arrived was excellent The portions were generous everything tasted great We also had garlic bread as a starter and apple pie for dessertThe decor of the place is very simple nothing fancy here There are nice pictures from Italy mostly Sicily and some AC Milan decor Angelo certainly isnt very talkative but hes welcoming and makes good foodRecommendedThis is something of a hidden gem It wouldnt fare well if you were to judge on looks alone It is run by a slightly grumpy Italian man who I assume is Marcella he is never to be rushed so if you are eating in it may seem he has forgotten your order but he hasnt The interior is decorated in plastic flowers plastic fruit and blue tiling However I urge you to look past this as it all adds to the unique experience of Marcella and if you are anything like me you will learn to love the quirks of this establishment Serving big plates of hot tasty filling food at budget prices is my go to place after a long cold grey Edinburgh day A huge plate of pasta garlic bread and a drink will set you back 5 If you want to splash out on a three course feast you wont be out of pocket by more than around 12As well as great pizza and pasta you should also try one of the many sweet pies and pastries he erves Rather than going to one of the many coffee shop chains around head to Marcella and get yourself a pie and cappucino for the same price as a skinny latte in a certan multi national coffee chain that shall remain nameless"

    "review":"I met a couple of American friends in here for lunch and was immediately impressed with the ambience and dcor Although its essentially a pubrestaurant now the building has clearly enjoyed a more salubrious past and the present appearance exhibits some echoes of thatTheres a modest but select choice of real ales on hand pumps and plenty in the whisky and spirits range to keep you occupied for an evening It wasnt too busy as we arrived at the end of lunch hour so we easily found a table After some minutes when no waiting staff had appeared to offer menus I picked some up myself and we quickly flagged down a passing waitress to order lunch None of us were particularly hungry as it turned out so in the end I opted for breaded cod bites on a focaccia sandwich with a wee dish of skinny fries which was pretty basic but tasty enough for a lunch bite A bit of salad to go with it wouldnt have gone amiss though My companions chose crisps and dips olive and red pepper which would have been a nice snack to go with your beer but a bit sparse for anything else I thoughtOverall I like the ambience of this place and would happily return for a more substantial meal if Im in the area The fact that they have a small car park is certainly a bonus in this part of townThe Salisbury Arms is a nice pub and restaurant near Pollock Halls on Dalkeith Road Ive not eaten here yet so my review cannot include the food element but I have heard good things from friendsThe ambience of the place is very nice Theres usually a nice mix of people students families work colleagues and the staff are friendly and welcoming in my experience Prices are higher than I normally like to pay on my student budget Not only this but when I went to buy a pint of Peroni advertised as 380 on the menu I was charged 440 Quite annoyingI will likely be back in future given its location close to where I live and hopefully I will try the food thenMmmm  To be fair I had a light breakfast and was deprived of lunch today  Dinner here was a bit late too  That being saidThe chips were the absolute best Ive had in the UK so far   The fish was also the best  The cheese duo to start with was really good especially the onion cheese which ever it was  The beer was good bitter and twisted  Dessert was good too The Sampler  Above all the waitresses were Cheerful and helpfulGiven Ive been a week in Scotland with no scotch I asked for two very different but good single malts  The bartender came out to ask what I was looking for  Ultimately she decided that Laphroaig and the Edinburgh malt Glenkinchie would be the selections  But that is beside the point  The point is that she took the time to come out and talk to me about my request even if briefly  Excellent customer serviceThe bill was better than expected given the feast we ordered5 starsWhen I walked in here I loved it immediately  the stylish decor made it so inviting cosy and relaxing and I instantly envisioned many more happy visits here There is a dining area and separate seating area of sofas tables and chairs to enjoy a drinknap on cosy fire lovely mood lighting and various paintings of Scottish nature and artefacts hanging from the wall I  felt as though I could have been in Scottish country house hotel and so I would refer to it as my little get away when I want away from the Edinburgh city buzzI attended the Yelp Xmas meal which initially I enjoyed but if I was to deconstruct it I would say: I was impressed by my starter of brie  a whole chunk dressed with apricot sauce  delicious Thankfully my main course tasted better than it looked  pork belly with smash potato and cranberry sauce slapped on the side sitting in a greasy looking gravy and perched on top was an onion ring  i was missing real veggies here maybe I missed those details on the menu so I stole a sprout from the plate next to mine For dessert it was Yuletide log with berries and this looked better than it tasted   a little smaller than I expected and the log was rather dry However I wasnt put off and definately want to come back and eat here again as I have heard so many good things about the food and the look and feel of the place had me when I first set foot insideOn dalkieth road previously known as the crags A  total transformation   great wine list by the glass or bottle20 for a bottle of champagne on Friday Extensive menu  steak game fish  daily specials All within a contemporary scottish hunting lodge theme One to visitThe refurbished Salisbury Arms formerly a Scream pub has had a stylish makeover The do an excellent value light lunch with plenty of friendly staff on hand to help with choices When the sun is out their terrace is a great little spot"

    "review":"The Hub is a well established events venue which is owned by the Edinburgh International Festival and also includes a cafe called Cafe Hub keeping it real and a ticket office The Hub is housed in a really striking renovated church building near the top of the Royal Mile and is a pretty clear landmark for anyone trying to navigate their way around the Old TownIve been to the Assembly Hall upstairs in the Hub plus another one of the smaller rooms for an arts event and they both provided a pleasant atmosphere for socialising and relaxing The interior of the Hub is bright and modern in contrast to the gothic exterior of the building The cafe comes well recommended with its selection of hearty breakfast and lunch options all at inexpensive pricesThe Hub is a venue owned and run by the International Festival right in the heart of Edinburgh Converted from a beautiful church this main festival venue which can be hired out for functions also contains a large cafe restaurant The beautiful church facade is unfortunately a little let down by the modern interiorIve been to the Hub cafe a few times to meet people for coffee or lunch on businessy sort of meetings Its a fantastic location right at the top of the Mile and just around the corner from the castle This is probably the main cause for the Hubs businessDespite the beautiful building and the convenient location the cafe isnt the best It serves ordinary sorts of teas and coffees and light lunches The lunches themselves arent terrible after finally extending their menu but the prices are For what you get which is fairly small portions of fancy food dressed up the cost is too much In the past the staffing has been too slow and a bit inconsistentA great location venue but with a poor cafe and a lot of room for improvementWe walked by The Hub a couple of times before actually deciding to go in for lunch It was a near thing but Im glad we chose to stop hereThe building is impressive on its own and the space that The Hub occupies is just as lovely There are leaded tall windows that let in a lot of natural light right next to modern art and chrome It doesnt sound like it should work but it doesThe dining room is warm and inviting with tables for dining and couches for relaxing They have a pastry bar up front if youre so inclined or a full kitchen in the backWe were shown to a table right away and placed our drink orders  chai latte for me regular latte for him  before taking our time with the menu Most of the things looked really good so it was hard for me to choose but I eventually decided to go with a half sandwich smoked salmon and the soup of the day creamy tomato My husband got the mushroom risottoOur waitress was very friendly and helpful and seemed almost reluctant to interrupt us if we were in the middle of a conversation But she was sweet and efficient which we both really appreciatedThe food was actually really good I didnt expect a whole lot to be honest but the quality was there I enjoyed my sandwich  the fish was smoked without being too smoky and was served on artisan bread with condiments and a small salad on the side My husbands risotto was the clear winner though I shamelessly helped myself to more than one spoonful off of his plate and was surprised to find that the risotto was creamy and full of flavor It was also a rather large serving which was a bonus since I couldnt stop myself from eating off his plateThis was a very good find  from the location to the service to the food Had we more time in the city we would have absolutely gone back for another mealI was a guest at the Hub for three days as part of a Marketing Conference It is a beautiful venue with very friendly staff who looked after us expertly Often times Conference venues can let themselves down with the simple things such as making sure delegates have enough drinking water and snacks The Hub had no such problems with the staff being dutiful The venue itself is gorgeous with high ceilings in the Amphitheatre and a great vibe There is also a quiet backstage space for speakers to conduct interviews and prepare The WiFi at the venue was complimentary but sadly like so many free WiFi offerings failed to cope with 120 attendees trying to use it with connections timing out and failingI didnt get an opportunity to try the tourist visitor area downstairs but I spotted a Cafe and some relaxing spaces Great venue that Id highly recommend to any conference organisers Id give this venue 5 stars if they could install some conference strength WiFi facilities as this is a must for any modern conference guestWas a former churchIs the festival centreHave a decent lunchWhats not to like about a 5 lunch  The Hub has a great location on the Royal Mile an attractive dining room pleasant servers and has a set deal of 5 for soup and sandwichPlus by the time we got there after touring the Castle and strolling down Castle hill we did not want to go one step further"

    "review":"Been looking forward to this recent edition to Marchmonts eateries opening for some time so we took ourselves along for a lunch time treat recently The decor is great contemporary Asian with some nice little touches There seemed to be plenty of seating both bar style at the windows and tables in the main area For such a small space they really have made the most of what they could do The service was friendly and efficient when we arrived Grab a seat decide on what takes your fancy then order at the counter All good so far My missus opted for the Agedashi Tofu soup with some Asian slaw on the side and I grabbed a Beef Pho When the food arrived the dishes were quite small for the price and we werent too taken by what we received The Agedashi Tofu soup seemed like standard miso soup with some spring onions and a couple of large tofu bits in the bottom of the bowl she wasnt keen and neither was I This was lacking in flavour and was under whelming for 6 We have both had this before so we knew what to expect and this was very different in presentation and flavours The slaw just seemed to be regular slaw with some sesame oil or similar added in tasty but when I think of the wealth of flavours from Asia I was expecting this to be more complex My beef po was nice lots of noodles veg bit of beef and subtle beef broth I would eat this again but from previous experiences I was expecting this to be presented with condiments on the side so you can adjust the soup to your liking such as changing the ration of sweet to hot Wasnt bad would order the po again but I have had betterOverall not a bad place seemed expensive for what you get and a nice selection of exotic foods on the menu Aiming to head back as this was their second week  open so willing to see where this place goes as it has a lot of promiseI really liked this place I only have gotten takeaway here on my way back from yoga but I find the flavors fresh and delicious The inside of the place is bright and clean great for a casual lunch or light dinner There arent too many places to get Vietnamese style food in the area so I do enjoy it The hoisin chicken summer salad rolls are SO delicious and my favorite light dinner I mean look how good they are I look forward to going back and trying a bunch of other thingsThere should be a word for when you set your expectations too high and the end result is  unsurprisingly  less than satisfyingSaikodYou got saikodThat worksAnyone who hangs around the talk boards will probably be aware of my hunt for a decent Banh Mi sandwich here in the capital Besides Thai we really do struggle for some quality South East Asian fayre So when I catch wind of a decent Vietnamese deli or a Malaysian street food place Ill need to check that badboy outBlythe was good enough to recommend Marchmonts Saiko as a solution to my Banh Mi woes So on my birthday day off guess where we headedThe girl inside was very nice and friendly Considering the place was dead I think thats nuff said Said hello took our order took our money said goodbye smiled a lot The endSo walking out of Saiko bagged sandwich in hand I first noticed the shape was wrong Banh Mi real Vietnamese ones tend to adhere to a specifically shaped baguette The baguette in my bag was not it instead a long and narrow number you might find in a supermarket housed the contents of pork pate coriander and pickled vegWhat there was of itYes the biggest gripe of this visit was in the contents of the sandwich Two words: not very much A thin layer of pork bolstered by wads of veggies to try and make it look substantial but even they didnt seem to do the job It all came across a bit too bready and downright stingieConsidering this badboy  a sandwich people  costs a whopping 595 I would really expect a little generosity between the bread The flavour was all present and correct and I must say even quite authentic but with such a measly filling the bread overwhelmed it all DisappointingIll get myself back there one day  the menu looked interesting and Ill be curious to see if they are more generous with other dishes like their Pad Thai or their Dim Sum  but for now I think Banh Mi Quest continuesCos I got saikodVietnamese food is hard to come by in the UK yet there I was craving a vegetarian pho and a Banh mi In London there are many authentic Vietnamese earteries none of which offer the easytocomeby chay cuisine Buddhist vegetarian on offer in Vietnam Saiko offers a bit of a mish mash of different cuisines and flavours though the main offerings are Vietnamese and Japanese fusion dishes Upon entering I knew I would be going for the much soughtafter Banh mi I opted for the ginger tofu filling For 595 the baguette was pretty small but the bread was surprisingly very good from la Barantine maybe the peanut sauce was very fresh and tasty and the tofu was crunchy The salad and coriander inside were as would be expected colourful and tastyNot sure what I think yet about Saiko kitchen but the quality of what I had was good I enjoyed the baguette but found it to be a little expensive if you consider Vietnamese prices no good comparison I know"

    "review":"Came out here for a big family meal I honestly cant fault a thing  they accommodated all 10 of us service was friendly and efficient The food Oh man Every course was absolutely delicious I had a pigeon breast to start pork belly for the main and finished off with creme brle All well portioned good size well presented and tasted fantastic Highly recommendedAn outstandingly good new bistro on Commercial Quay Bistro Provence is well worthy of your attention next time youre looking for some classic French fare I visited at that odd time between lunch and dinner service but found their allday menu very accommodating Service is as friendly as youll find too Overall we said: Bistro Provence is a very impressive new addition to Leiths parade of restaurant excellence The menu radiates local freshness and dishes are executed to a very high standard I look forward to visiting at a more conventional hour to sample more of the Gallic delights from their menuI was here about 2 Saturdays ago alone as I was looking around for a restaurant to eat  The only French restaurant I have ever eaten in Edinburgh is La Garrigue  The chef waitress  manager were all French which I thought was a good sign  I was expecting the same quality but unfortunately I was wrong  The managers and waitress were all very polite and well mannered  It is unfortunate that the food quality was just mediocre and average  I mistakenly chose a 3 course set meal for dinner as opposed to lunch but the manager was very kind and talked to the kitchen staff and they were willing to prepare the dinner set for me  I am unsure if the limited time to get ready the dinner food before dinner actually affected the quality of the food  If that was the case then they should have said no to me ordering the dinner during lunch  I had Baked scallops served  la Provenale as the starter  The scallops were fresh and delicately prepared but the roasted peppers that came with it tasted like they were from the jars  I had Duck legs with ratatouille roast garlic and tapenade sauce as the main  The duck was a bit tough for a leg dark meat and seems like they were deep fried from as opposed to properly prepared French style  The worst was actually the desert  The Creme Brulee tasted like a thick custard and not a proper Creme Brulee  I judge French food by their Creme Brulee but this not Creme Brulee so it felt like I actually have nothing French to judge in this restaurant  I have been to France for food and yes the chef is French but quality is really not up to French scratch  A bit of a let down  The only pro is that the waitress  manager were very nice to me  But I eat in a restaurant for the food not really the service  Once is enough I thinkThe Voucher Royals went out for dinner This time a little more local : Leith The Bistro Provence was the lucky restaurant of todays voucher Located on the Commercial Quay which houses Mithas International Starters The Kitchen Bond No9 Fatma and the likes Youd be forgiven to think this was another one in a long line of restaurants the Quay is known for : Specialist and individual and a little pricey  and youd be correct They specialise in hearty French Cuisine so that means acceptable portion sizes but still enough to be filling without getting stuffed Their welcome was all Bonjour and Comment a va  which I liked and we bought into the whole Frenchy Frenchy thing they have going on I found the place a little to brightly lit it was cosy but more fit for a library than an intimate dinner Tables are place regimented throughout the restaurant We were seated close to the conservatory windows overlooking the Scottish Government Possibly because this was a voucher deal we received a special set menu Which provided ample choices Starters and Main courses included some supplements and desserts for an extra 5 Anita had Parmesan  salsify rolls served with almond salad  aioli to start and a Duck breast with ratatouille roast garlic and a tapanade sauce 250 suppI decided on the Chicken and a Duck foie gras parfait toasted brioche and Muscat jelly and for main a Confit pork belly with Potato galette apples and red wine sauceWe also received a complimentary cottage cheese profit and bread and butterSo far so very masterchef The foie gras parfait starter for me was light airy and very delicate I liked it My main of rolled pork belly was delicious the meat was succulent and the fatty bits ever so softly crunchy YumThe potato galette though thinly sliced felt a bit undercooked but was also seared on the edges OKish It worked well with the kale vegetable dish I wasnt too impressed with their presentation  a little brown No real colour variations and not very inviting We also ordered a dessert to share A Crme brle This is a staple dessert and we both expected a good French execution of this It came out wobbly there wasnt enough crack and the inside was a little too runny It did taste very nice like a vanilla custard The service was attentive but we got the impression they were all a bit nervous As they have just recently opened they may feel the pressure We did get to speak to the ownermanager and he was genuinely pleased to have us in his restaurantWe decided that this place will need a revisit as the food is delicious and the little niggly things can be addressed"

    "review":"This is a pretty good chippy located just off Dundee Street on Yeaman Place The chips are pretty good and not completely covered in grease which is always a bonus This place will always be remembered for me as being the first place that I had a battered Mars bar and I must admit I thought it tasted delicious and have subsequently had a few since but only as a rare treatThe place also does a good range of other food as well as fish and chips although I have not tried anything else on their menu They do home made pizzas burgers and baked potatos at all very reasonable pricesReasonably priced and decent quality Aquamarina is a good local chip shop The chips have that glorious balance of crisp outside and fluffy inner that we all want from a chippy and they are never caked in grease or soggyIt is a very small chip shop and you will normally need to wait for either chips or your fishpiesausage though occasionally everything is ready to go I dont really mind this since at least you know the food hasnt been sitting for long periods of time but it can make the place look busy or feel crampedAll in all though a decent place to grab a quick bite to eatTop food to begin with but starting to go south now its getting established had a smoked sausage supper tonight and had to bin it bad show aqua"

    "review":"Im not really masterfully adept at recognising a good Indian: my weak British mouth cant handle the chilli and often leaves an unshakeable burning sensation for the rest my meal ultimately ensuring I cant make head or foot of what Im eatingDeciding to man up and rekindle my Indian food knowledge I opted for the BBCs kashmiri curry with a liberal dose of Cobra beer  Much to my surprise I found I could recognise each flavour rather than  sweating the spices away and subsequently had an enjoyable mealReasonably priced and with a cool name Ill be back againThis great little Indian restaurant is located in the Tollcross area of the city  Like Sam I have a palette that prefers nonspicy food so I ordered a mild curry when I visited here for a friends leaving meal  It wasnt at all busy on the night I visited  The waiters were vigilant and it did almost feel like we were being watched as we sat and ate the meal  The food was very tasty though and appeared swiftly after ordering  This was no doubt helped by the fact that there werent many customersThis place didnt bowl me over like Kismot but it was still a good night out with some tasty food  I would like to go back some time and I suggest you bear it in mind as a place worth visitingI had the spiciest curry EVER in Bombay Bicycle Club for lunch one day and I dont think my tongue has ever recovered  This restaurant serves authentic Indian cuisine and there is a really lovely and homely feel to the inside Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh Bombay Bicycle Club is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach Their lunch menu is truly awesome and they offer a wide range of Indian dishes I had the onion bhaji to start which was very tasty followed by chicken with a chili and garlic curry sauce They give little warnings next to each dish stating whether the meal is mild or hot which is handy but I paid no attention to it and went charging in and ordered a hot dish and boy was it hot The curry was really delicious and full of flavour but my tongue had gone pretty numb after a while from the heat and so I couldnt taste much I feel I should just warn you that extreme caution ought to be paid to the menu when you are choosing your meal and the next time I go here I will definitely play it safe and order a mild curry Bombay Bicycle Club serve tandoori and biryani dishes as well as the more traditional currys such as madras There is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes on offer Takeaways are also available here and they offer a FREE home delivery service  amazing  Bombay Bicycle Club is a fantastic curry house and one I will definitely be going back toVery good food here  Living in Naples we dont get that many varieties so were happy to travel anywhere and branch outside Italian cuisine  This made us happy  It was crowded on a Saturday but they fit us into a snug spot  Only flaw was that our appetizer came out a little cold on the inside never a good sign  They were apologetic and gave us a second with another free appetizer  The entrees of curry masala and tandoori were all excellentWe visited Bombay Bicycle Club last week as a 2 year anniversary hurrah following up with some good old Fringe fun Ive passed this place so many times but never managed to make it in as most of my stories start I swear when I say this I mean it  its been a good 10years I am not entirely convinced it was worth it I started with vegetable samosas  that looked like they came out of Costco  pretty forgettable The boys prawn puri looked much more and tasted much better than my option  its normally my staple so I was pretty envious as I looked at my sad samosas For the main the boy went for the Marco Polo chicken which he devoured happily and I had the tandoori trout Lovely seasoning on the trout but cooked a little too dry We also shared the Afghan chickpeas which were pretty delicious as an accompaniment Naan was too dry and toasted Now Ive given it two stars for why Well foodwise while the main was pleasant the starter I had was just eh I need to find a better word for eh but at the moment thats all I can come up with The mains were pleasant but in terms of comparing to another restaurant it isnt food that stands out as memorable or particular adept at handling the flavours that can be ohsoamazing or delivered with a blunt hammer So it would be a 3 star for that  i drop down to two because I thought the service was pretty lame Very disinterested and when you are trying to call the waiter back because hes wandered off halfway through taking your order that isnt a sign of good service really if you think that is then we need to have a conversation and doesnt inspire the whole tipping thang yknow Im at a loss for all the praise as I didnt really experience something that blew my mind more something that was more mundane than we would have likedSo I am a notorious curry fiend Its all I want to eat all day long and I just cant get enough All my friends have learnt not to get in the way of me and my curry Luckily Edinburgh has curry houses aplenty to help me get my fix so many in fact that its easy to get overwhelmed and just order from your closest restaurant time and time again Well if your closest restaurant is not Bombay Bicycle Club and you havent yet given it a go you must promise me you will I spent a month this Summer in India giving in to all my curry cravings and when my friends wanted to go for an Indian 2 days after I was back in Edinburgh I was really nervous about whether Id enjoy it or whether comparisons with the Mother Land would leave me in tears The BBC was incredible  authentic full of traditional spices and serious about its menuI ordered the Marco Polo chicken from the chefs recommendations section of the menu not a traditional curry name I know but wait til you eat  you just wont care It was rich wellspiced tangy and saucy with beautifully marinated chicken strips which were huge All of my friends were similarly impressed with what they ordered  so much so noone offered anyone else a taste being so happy and protective of their own The restaurant itself is bright and light and the service was fine nothing to rave about but the food most certainly is Its not the cheapest curry on the block with traditional curries being at least 9 for chicken and the chefs specials 10 but the taste and ingredients are definitely worth splashing out for"

    "review":"Une super adresse pour les sushis Ils nont pas de restaurant et tout ce fait  emporter mais cest divin Les sushis sont parfait Moi qui nen tait pas une grande fan l jen redemande  Nous avons pris le plateau  30 pounds si je me souviens bien mais a le vaut largement Je connaissais les sushis aux poissonsais ceux  la viande tait  se damner  A essayer  tout prixI only discovered Soul Sushi one week ago and I have already been three times Enough said except to say Its fantastic Woo We ordered the Land and Sea platter between the two of us I suspect its more suitable for three people but we both have big appetites especially for sushi Its excellent value for money and a good way to try out the various combinations on offer I particularly enjoyed the herbridean salmon avocado maki and the breaded king prawn roll as did my eating partner The salmon avocado maki are MASSIVE in comparison to the ones Ive had in various restaurants with large chunks of salmonTo my delight Soul Sushi is very close to my flat therefore both times Ive gone for collection Each time they apologised and informed me there would be a wait due to high demand evidently and the fact I was ordering in the evening over the weekend but even then the wait was minimal Only 3040 mins so when theyre not busy they must be mad swiftThe only slight disappointment I had even before I ate there was that they didnt have soft shell crab roll on the menu They have so many other tasty options though it wasnt missed However if they did eventually add this to the menu I would be ecstatic Just sayingSo this Friday coming I know what Ill be eating See you soon SOUL SUSHI :Found this place on yelp Im a big sushi fan so decided to try this as the menu looked and had good reviews Wasnt disappointed We got the salmon box and tuna box  spicy salmon roll and seaweed salad Well presented  even pretty packaging There was a decent sized pieces of fish avocado  and seaweed  Only complaint would be that the spicy salmon wasnt spicy at all  However everything was tasty of good quality and service excellent  easy to order  Englishspeaking and even gave good directions We picked up  so would be useful to note the googlemaps doesnt locate properly  its at the junction near the church  along the street with a few other takeaways with a white front Would recommendSoul sushi has won over my heart very creative flavours and winning combinations Loved their vegetarian options as well as their seared beef ones The only criticism is their delivery options dont include all postcodes in edinburghSoul Sushi dont delivery to the West side of Edinburgh and its probably a good thing or else Id order from them far more often They do huge 46 piece garden platters for 26 which easily feed three and could probably happily feed four if ordered with side dishes As someone whos allergic to fish they have loads of vegetarian options and they are all super tasty I especially love the butternut squash rolls and teriyaki tofu The fish sushi is also quite tasty according to those who could eat it  For event catering the platters are good value and look really impressive but they also work for sitting on the living room floor while drinking wine and avoiding packing boxes Seriously Soul Sushi expand the delivery area to my side of the city or Ill just have to keep getting my friend who lives round the corner from you to carry a ridiculous amount of sushi across town on the busYou know 4 stars feels a bit mean as I really enjoyed our sushi last night but I think Im going to wait a little longer before giving Soul Sushi 5 mostly to check that theyre brilliant every timeSoul Sushi is a delivery service and whilst Id heard of them before through the Twittersphere etc I hadnt had the chance to try it myself  Recently however they joined Just Eat which really meant I had no excuses not to give them a go  Last night we finally placed an order and it was just what the doctor orderedTheres a variety of maki hosomaki sashimi inside out rolls and nigri to choose from as well as miso soup edamame and a couple of salads  The most economical way to order is to order a couple of boxes which have 3 different types of sushi or even better a platter  We swithered over the set meal for two good value at 24 but in the end went for 3 boxes  the Loch Duart Salmon box salmon and avocado maki salmon hosomaki and salmon nigri the Field box beef tataki inside out roll chicken katsu inside out roll and asparagus nigri and the Allotment box butternut squash and sweet chilli inside out roll mixed vegetable maki and more asparagus nigri  The boxes range between 575 and 9 and you get 1012 pieces in each so its both filling and reasonably pricedOh my it was all good and very tasty  The stand out dish was easily the butternut squash and sweet chilli but honestly I enjoyed every bit of it  A little pot each of soy sauce pickled ginger and wasabi was delivered too and wow was that wasabi hot I love wasabi and this was blasting my sinuses like never before AmazingIm not a sushi expert so I cant tell you how this compares with sushi joints all over the world but let me tell you it was damn tasty and much much better than your YO or supermarket stuff  Plus it was excellent value for money for sushi that is  We will definitely be ordering from Soul Sushi again"

    "review":"Despite the stunning lack of originality in the naming department this is a bar that Leith Walk has been in need of for some timeQuieter in terms of atmosphere than the likes of Boda etc you feel under no pressure to neck as much booze as possible and stumble out into the night  chilling out in the comfy dark wood surroundings is fun enoughGiven the larger premises there is a larger range of drinks available than at the Drummond Street branch so the opportunities for trying something new are greater Innis  Gunns new Rum Cask brew goes down well at around the 3 mark 74 so plenty of bang for your buck and they also stock a couple of Stewarts bottled products as well as a bunch of othersI can see myself going here quite often in the year aheadThe tortilla pizzas on the menu are a great invention  the Monday night quiz makes for an enjoyable start to the weekThis is the second time Ive been there this week on an Edinburgh daytrip its starting to feel like an honorary local Pub quiz with a vegan meetup group was the reason on Monday  and today was the case of an hour before my bus leaves  where is close by where service will be reasonably fast and I know I can eat  Also  because of the excellently labelled vegan options on the menu and Id spied a couple of options to keep in mind for a return trip On Monday I had the vegan chilli dog 9  which I suspect is Linda McCartney sausages  which comes with skinny fries Normally I find skinny fries a bit mediocre to wedgesthick cut chips but these were really tasty Service for most of us was pretty quick  though one of my friends had to wait some time an hour  because of an oversight somewhere leading to lack of a matching table number Tonight service was very fast thankfully  we made our bus and Id opted for the vegan burger Its a good firm patty and comes in a seeded bun with sauce on top and bottom of the patty  I think a salsa of some kind Unless its unwelcome mayo and its vegan Im not too fussy and I dont always notice these things It comes with the skinny fries  and a noncreamy coleslaw Im told by friends that many of the drinks on their menu are vegan  I opted for an Innis  Gunn beer on Monday and today I got a Williams Bros Midnight Sun  otherwise the beers arent labelled so if youre bothered about alcohol being animal productfree checking the Barnivore website is often a good bet Their soup is labelled vegan  and they have a vegan special this week was tarka dal  and a dipping platter with a few things including hummus and pesto and flatbread The decor is made up of dark red walls featuring movie posters  and both sofa areas and tables with chairs to suit whichever seating area you feel like having I feel quite relaxed in there and could easily sit with a pint or two for an hour  The TV was showing a movie with subtitles  and although maybe a little antisocial  I was pleased to see it as so many times I have seen pubs showing TV programmes or movies with just the picture and no subtitles or audio   what is the point in that Its 50p charge if you want to use a creditdebit card but they do also offer cashbackMet a big group of people from grad school there  great venue for a large group meeting A friend and I showed up a bit earlier so we could get something to eat We were both impressed with the nontraditional pub options there were good veggie options and fusion influenced burgers and curry dishes Cool place good prices for food creative pub foodWir sind rein weil wir am Eingang das Angebot gesehen hatten Geld zu sparen wenn man zwei Burger statt einen oder verschiedene nimmt Also drinnen hingesetzt und als nach zehn Minuten noch immer niemand kam an die Bar dort hie es recht unfreundlich: Ja aber nicht heute Trotzdem geordert auch Bier Fr Bier und Ale gibts eine riesige Karte aus der wir uns wohl das falsche Bier herausgesucht haben  denn gut wars nicht Die Burger waren klein fielen auseinander und hatten kaum Geschmack Ambiente: Durchschnittlich Fazit: Nicht empfehlenswertOne of the best pubs in Edinburgh and certainly my favourite in Leith An amazing selection of beers from around the world great staff and knowledgeable too as they select the beers cool music and the food is outstanding try the burgers pizza or cheeseboard All of which attracts a great crowd of friendly regularsIt could do without the obnoxious fruit machine but that aside there really isnt anything not to likeI was very pleasantly surprised at how nice this pub is Its roomy the seating is set out nice for relaxing and chatting Relaxed atmosphere with a mixed crowd in it Leith prices with an uptown feel The bar staff were excellent polite and attentive I would definitely go back"

    "review":"Really not great I would probably go as to far to say the worst Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at and I have been to some truly horrendous ones I came here last month with a couple of friends against our better judgement as it was completely empty at about 7 in the evening but we still dined here The food was really not tasty I had onion bhajis to start which were dry and tasteless and my friends had a selection of kebabs which they said were chewy and they really looked unappealing The curries were equally awful I had the chicken bhuna which had a super watery sauce and the chicken was really chewy and stringy and there was a layer of oil on the whole thing making it taste rank to be honest The rice was also over cooked and was pretty soggy To their credit though the nan bread was tasty was was the best part of the meal  but it would be pretty difficult to mess that up The meal was really expensive too with two courses coming to about 17  really not worth it I found the staff rude and unhelpful and overall had a pretty nasty experience Dont be fooled  just because a restaurant is on the Royal Mile does not mean it is good I learnt the hard wayI had a surprisingly good time here I say surprisingly cause we wanted Indian and picked the closest place to the hotel I thought it would be touristy and expensive and crap and it wasnt The food was better than good and it was reasonable enough prices The food also came with this mint dipping sauce which was divine Next time Im in Edinburgh I will definitely try and make it backVery nice ownerTerrible food and ridiculously overpriced plus a 10 compulsory service charge  They should be wearing balaclavas   A total rip offNot bad Ive had better food elsewhere but its definitely decent  My wife and I ordered the tikka curry and the mixed grill with basmati rice and naan  The food came out quickly and the service was very goodJust went there today The quality and quantity of food and service you receive isnt worth their very high prices I got chicken kurma which came with barely any chicken and it was tasteless Also I had to pay an extra 360 for rice and 365 for naan on top of 13 for the chicken Ive gotten much better Indian food at other places for half the price and I definitely felt ripped offAlso the server took 10 minutes to even say hi to us and never looked in on us but decided cleaning empty tables was more important than current customers Would definitely not recommend there are much better options available"

    "review":"The Cramond Inn isnt quite loyal to its namesake By that I mean its no longer an inn I was told it was back in the day this place is over a hundred years old but that now its just kept the name for the sake of it Another bit of info I got from the bartender whos been working there with her husband for 7 years is that the outside hasnt changed since the olden days There are relics of its old age in photos around the pub These photos sport pushbikes horsedrawn carriages and then some of those sweet old cars from the automobiles toddler years The insides huge and painted a deep reddish brownish colour There might be a name for this colour Maroon possibly Its the same colour as my kitchen Its a colour that brings me warmth and comfort But what really really brings me warmth and comfort is the fact that its a Sammy Smiths pub For all yall who dont know what that means: its very simple really All their beer on tap is by the Yorkshire based brewery Samuel Smiths To all ye beer aficionados out there: they sell it cheap And theres one helluva range I took my family there and so we decided to get a range of beers Six pints at the bartenders recommendation: we got a wheat beer a stout a dark ale a lager a cider and probably something else I cant quite recall It was real delicious The Cramond Inn might be a bit out of the way ok so its really outta the way but youll get your moneys worth there Just hop on the 41 to Cramond and get off at the second to last stop Go for a wee wander around the village and then go grab some grub at the InnAn olde world pub in a lovely setting  Julia S described it beautifully in her previous review over two years ago  it seems that in a good way not much has changed Friendly clientele a roaring fire  the wheat beer is lovelyFood took nearly an hour to turn up  Potatoes raw  sausages left under heat lamp solid and inedible carrots dry and inedible cheese and bacon burger with no salad turned up with salad but without cheese and with about 4 chips Worst pub meal Ive ever hadThe Cramond Inn is ideally placed for folk who are waiting for the tide to allow a wander over to Cramond Island which apparently is only an island for part of the time Its an old mans type bar with a good selection of ales and pub fare menu On a chilly day its also amazing to get by one of the four wood fires and get toastyThe only problem with the Cramond Inn is its rather peculiar times for serving food As I mentioned it sits by a place that walkers will frequently use so what would be better than something warm as you arrive back from a walk across the causeway thats fine if the walk finishes after 1pm but if youd like an early lunch then its a no go There is a captive market being the only place for miles so it seems quite silly not to capitalise on itThere was another review that almost steered me away from coming here The brewery sponsoring The Cramond Inn is Samuel Smiths They are not unheard of and the beer was quite nice This pub is very cozy and patrons friendly We ate the sticky toffee pudding and raspberry crumble Both deliciousThe staff were patient and friendly Im glad for going there"

    "review":"Youd be hard pressed to find a better value venue for your office Christmas dinner than the NYSP Having known the name for years Ive only this year taken heed of advice to check it out and my party of 20 were all well fed and watered with 3 courses for 1895  corkage of just 1 for wine one in the eye for all the places that charge 3 times as much in the age of screw topsIts an intimate venue to say the least and the potential for a toilet queue is probably the major negative about the place but the service was swift and cheery and youre pretty much left to just get on and enjoy yourselves whilst the staff beaver away in the background Steaks were all cooked as ordered and the main course helpings were generousThe menu at this American style restaurant is my ideal wholesome slightly heavy and just a little bit unhealthy The Steam Packet  I know is located on Rose Street one of Edinburghs quirkier streets and like many other restaurants in town theyve got a pretheatre menu Im starting to wonder how many people actually go to the theatre here or if its just become popular to say so They function around bookings so whilst theres an official closing time it all depends on how many reservations there areTheyve got some delicious starters and I had a little giggle at the gangsta harlem dip The main dishes are heffers though including steaks burgers and enchiladas For dessert you can have a pecan pie or choc fudge cake :DId definitely work up an appetite before eating there thoughFantastic food great atmosphere and would definitely eat here again The  burgers and steak are two of favourites generally id say to give it a gowhen organising a work night out it can be hard to find a venue that is willing to host a dozen plus women and one man from HR that are looking for a decent meal without paying loads of money  fortunately New York Steam Packet fits this criteria quite well a three course meal for 1595 BYOB and 1 corkage  so last friday night this is where i headednow this place is well hidden thankfully getting dropped off right at the bottom of the alley way with the driver telling us its right up there made it a bit easier to find  however we were confronted with a short cobbled alley that had seen better days and us in 4 inch heels  arm in arm we walked as daintly as possible to the door only to be greeted by a rather ominous like spiral staircase  we walked up to the restaurant with a rather massive fear of how we would ever make it back down those stairs at the end of the meal  the restaurant itself is small and they do two seatings per evening  one at 6pm and the other at 8:15pm  its good for large parties though as they can accomodate about three large groups at each seating and dont seem bothered by loud laughter and chattingthe menu is fairly simple three courses for 1595 with about 6 choices per course  i went with the deep fried potato skins followed by the beef burger  the potato skins were ok i had expected them to have melted cheese in the middle as this is what potato skins are like in the states  but they were literally just deep friend large wedges of potatoes with a chilli mayo on the side  tasty enough but not exciting  the beef burger was much better though and i did really enjoy this  however the fries were a bit meh with a lot of them being soggy  my last course was chocolate fudge cake which was lovely but i was too full after only a few bites to try and finish this  the meal in total with tip and corkage fees for 12 of us was 21 each  hard to complain as i brought my own bottle of wine which i drank most ofoverall i thought New York Steam Packet was ok  i had a decent meal at good value but i wasnt overly impressed  Also the cobbled lane and stairs up to the restaurant are pretty much a death trap for any woman that wears heels so i had to knock a star off for this  id return if it was suggested for another night out but wouldnt rush backHaving discovered the NYSP at the Yelp event and had assurances from Kev that special needs Gluten Free wouldnt be an issue myself and Jackie G rocked up here early Friday night Although NYSP is BYOB both of us were a bit tired having indulged the night before so we wanted good food and soft drinks Tucked away in Rose St North Lane its still central Beware of tackling the winding stairs to the restaurant in heels or having been drinking but reaching upstairs youll find a really cute American restaurantThree courses from a set menu comes in at around 15 and is a total steal Lots of GF options loving a restaurant where I have lots of choices so potato skins to start with chilli mayo  lovely and crispy potato skins and tangy mayo then a sirloin steak which was huge Serious steak overdose here which covered half of the plate and was cooked to perfection came with chips needed after a fragile night before and salad little bit of healthy eating Even a GF option for pud  warm choc brownie and cream  yum Though I have to admit Id want Kev knighted if he could offer the Toffee Crunch Dime Bar Cake as a GF versionThis is a great wee restaurant  fab food and lovely chilled out atmosphere and well worth a visitI love the idea behind this place set menu BYOB New York themed and the setting of our first ever Yelp Movie NightSo when I walked up the twistytwindy Iron staircase after walking up a random alley off Rose Street I was pleasantly surprised And of course welcomed by many a familiar face The menu had a good selection of choice I was struggling wtith the Starter but ended up going for Mussels in white wine cream and garlic and lots of other things to make this quite simply the best bowl of Mussels I have had Then it was time to get out burger on I decided to stick with a simple beef burger All the burgers here are home made as I have been told from the man himself and it totally pays off Delicious Simple Then there was pudding Dime Pie My hips were screaming at me not to but I totally did and I loved every single mouthful of it Then came the Movie some drooling over Ryan Gosling bucket loads of banter and the infamous mario kart on the Nintendo 64 This is what made the night for me the guys here are just such a hoot and that is what makes that extra difference"

    "review":"Excellent Michelin starred restaurant with friendly service and wonderful food Get a seat near the window where you can watch the chefs do their stuffTom Kitchin isnt afraid to be adventurous in his mixes of flavours which often delivers a whole new taste treat but on the rare occasion strikes an odd discordant note on the palateLocal produce always fresh especially fishWe made a reservation here just to have dessert And it was just as amazing as we imagined I had an apple sorbet with apple slices that was just what I needed after a long day of sightseeing The one comment I have is that they were almost appalled we were there just for dessert and still had the wait staff go through setting the table for appetizers then taking the plates away setting for dinner taking that away and then finally for dessert I would definitely stress to them that youre just there for dessert so they know Other than that it was very lovely and well worth the 30 I spent on just dessert Sometimes you just have to splurge :This is one of the best 1star michelin restaurant I have been to Its a full experience food and watching the cooks at work There is indeed a big window into the kitchen that lets everyone see whats going on and grasp the electrical atmosphere in the cooking chamber The table are organised so that most people can peep in during their meal and appreciate the effort put into their food Its really cool to see Tom Kitchen put the final touches to your plate : It just makes the whole thing more excitingThe food itself is wonderful Really incredibly fresh and tasty Seasonal and imaginative We went for lunch and the 30ish pound menu is cheap compared to the quality of the food Quite a treat if you take some wine but nonetheless worthwhile and to be remembered I started with a pistachio rabbit  foie gras terrine with an onion tatin Just AMAZING Then I had pork cheeks cooked like a blanquette with a white sauce mushrooms carrots new potatoes Delicious The meat was so tender Then I had the rhubarbthemed dessert: rhubarb fresh soup with poached pieces of rhubarb rhubarb sorbet caramel croquante pannacotta I really really liked it So yummy And we had the traditional petitfours after that YumThe restaurant is a little remote and far from the city centre but its ok Its just in front of the Scottish government building Quite surreal actuallyExcellent restaurant and dining experience  The menu here changes seasonally I had the summer menu and Tom Kitchin really focuses on getting the best ingredients  The bone marrow with Devon snails Perthshire girolles and Bayonne ham is one of those dishes you remember for a long time The service was attentive without being intrusive knowledgeable and people were really warm Chef Kitchin was actually in the kitchen cooking  You dont see many celebrity chefs cooking anymore  at least not in NYCI went to The Kitchin around October last year so I cant remember many of the details of the night so ill keep this review to what stands out most to me Chef Tom lives and breathes his From nature to plate motto Using the finest ingredients in a setting that allows them to show off their natural flavours If you want to read more into this check out website where he explains in his own words There was one dish that I particularly enjoyed and that was the cod cheeks wrapped in pancetta Im gutted I never got a picture of that dish because it was presented perfectly on a pumpkin puree But I will never forget the taste and the texture until the day that I die The fish was soft moist and delicate but the pancetta was a little more harsh and bold It was the perfect combination The service was perfect It was efficient but never rushed I dont drink wine so I cant comment on the wine list but we did have the signature beer Named after Toms Grandpa which was a nice accompaniment to the meal The cocktails were impressive but im not sure they merit their price tag Theyre good but nothing spectacularSo glad I came here with my family I am not a big fan of haute cuisine anymore too much showing off and combining of strange flavours for me so I was a bit apprehensiveThe Kitchen shows that you can take cooking to a higher level using local ingredients keep the flavours individual and still have Michelin star foodI thought the costs were very competitive for the quality and would highly recommend anyone going for any occasion"

    "review":"I wasnt expecting too much from Saiyems when I first went there the bright yellow exterior shouted  tacky to me but my friend who lives locally to the area insisted that their curries are great and he was right We ordered on a Wednesday night just before a Champions League game and so it was quite busy with other people having the same idea of watching the match over a curry We waited inside the restaurant and it is a lot more quaint and respectable than the exterior although that isnt hard I ordered a chicken bhuna with 2 papadums and a garlic naan bread the prices here are pretty decent and for the quality and portions of food it offers good value The naan bread was one of the freshest I have had and not at all greasy whilst the chicken bhuna was flavoursome and the chicken very fresh and tenderThis shop is ugly it has dated one from 2011 magazines sitting on a coffee table and had I not been on a mission to try different Indians I would likely have walked past However on a mission I was and one part of the shop front actually stands up  For curry loversI have tried my usual selection of dishes biryani madras chilli garlic and have to say the food was of good standard rich spice flavours came through as they should and the meat has always been tender and flavoursome Part of that flavour though comes from the fact that they use chicken thigh and breast this does mean you may get the odd tough bit but overall it is worth itWhile the portions of curry and rice are roughly standard for an Indian takeaway probably enough to feed you for two nights if you compared the portion to a readymeal you get a big portion of pakora served in a polystyrene box The pakora curry and rice was around 10 so not expensive either given the quantity of foodAll in all I would recommend Saiyems if you stay in the area"

    "review":"As others have suggested this place is an absolute gem Weve now visited for both their lunch and evening menus and both were excellent The 795 threecourse lunch deal is quite unbelievable value  I cant think of better lunchtime value anywhere in the city The message is pretty clear: go soon and go oftenOverall we said: Michael Neave was extremely impressive The place has style and class aplenty and the seasonally changing menu offers wellexecuted imaginative dishes grounded in showcasing locally sourced produce I look forward to my next visitExcellent meal from a very talented chef and team Creative appetizers of wood pigeon and apricot ravioli were great We both had fish for our main sea bass and cod prepared very well Nice local ingredients featured We didnt have desert but the complimentary chocolates were wonderfulWas here for a special party hosted by a medical instrument company on a Monday night where they are normally closedI didnt have high expectations but was I wrong the main course the steak was maybe the best steak I ever had and this comparing with some of the Michelin restaurants and steakhousesHmmm this place is definitely worth a second visit You cant go wrong with the scallops and venison However I really want to go back and try the rest of the menu I found it very difficult to choose as everything looked so delicious I havent given it five stars because of the dessert but might change my mind when I return The service is ok not yet comparable to the Michelin star restaurants in Edinburgh I would recommend booking a table so youre not disappointedThis restaurant is tucked off the Royal mile  Although it is out of sight from the Main Street it has always been really full and twice I have been here without reservation I was turned down so do make a reservation if you do decide to come I ordered the Scallops and black pudding as starter and they were delicately cooked to perfection  The aroma of the black pudding goes well with the scallops and there light and not greasy at all  The highlight here I have to say is the rump of Lamb which I ordered as my main  They are cooked pink on a bed of mash bacon and broadbeans  So tender and juicy that I fell in love with them instantly  They are the best rump of lamb I have eaten in Edinburgh so far  I would happily come back here for the lamb again The panna cotta has just the right texture and right amount of sweetness to finish off my lovely 3 course mealMichael is an extremely talented chef and at his age he is excellent at what he does  I believe Michaels Steak and Seafood Bar is also one of his venture which mainly serves seafood  I have a review on it as well so do read it as they are equally as goodThree vistis in 6 days says it all really Why the fifth star Monday to Friday sees Michael Neave lay on an Express Lunch Menu for those on the go The idea is simple: set menu of 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from with a set dessert of Chocolate and Cranberry Brownie with coffee and a scoop of the Ice Cream of the DayVery good I hear you cry but why the fifth starThe dishes are fairly straightforward in order for those in a rush to come eat and go in an efficient fashion Although they may be straightforward that doesnt mean in any way that the courses arent of an extremely high standard This is fine dining after allSo Ive been lucky enough to sample this Express Lunch Menu twice this week:WednesdayStarter  Ham Hough with Melba Toast and Fig ChutneyMain  Roasted Venison Rump with Crushed Potatoes and OnionDessert  Brownie with Whisky Ice CreamFridayStarter  Game Terrine with fruit chutneyMain  Baked Salmon with a Smoked Fish ChowderDessert  Brownie with Vanilla Ice CreamTwo amazingly delectable mealsIndeed Joe very good But why the fifth starAs if the above isnt already enough the fifth star is awarded because of this:8 for said 3 course menu inclusive of coffeeFood of this quality is virtually impossible to find at this price In fact I defy anyone to find somewhere that rivals thisEvery time I go here for the Express Lunch I feel like Im robbing Michael Neave to the point where Ill order a cocktail or a drink just to ramp the bill up a littleIts ridiculous in the most amazing way ever Said it before see Los Cardos see Oink see Mosque Kitchen and Ill say it again the simple ideas are always the best"

    "review":"This place seemed like a fairly new restaurant  Located conveniently on Southbridge near a popular area  The chicken was flavorful both the peri peri shredded chicken and the chicken wings  If wanted they also provide extra sauce that you can serve yourself  Its self serve so you must order at the till when ready  I would recommend this place so why not give it a tryI would like to suggest you this restaurant The foods here are the same as Nandos but more delicious The size of each food is also bigger than Nandos I had a 12 chicken with sweet potatoes as side dish and cant finish all Next time if you are in Edinburgh come to try this restaurant You wont regretZuhus is a halal establishment which serves mainly chicken dishes  A lot of yelp reviews usually never reveal if an establishment is halal or not  I think it is important for us to include in the review if the establishment is halal as we also have a lot of Muslim Yelpers and friends who would love to know that and we can help them in selecting restaurantZuhus has a menu very much like Nandos  Or shall I say exactly like Nandos  Its basically mainly peri peri based chicken burgers and wraps  I came here twice but only had the peri peri chicken  The guy who served me was very accommodating  I ordered half a chicken but with 2 quarter chicken legs and he gave it to me  The taste of he chicken was up to scratch and the meat itself was juicy and tender  The size of the chicken I believe is slightly bigger than what Nandos is serving which is of course a value for money  They have won my points on all aspects on value taste and portion  However they have lost my point on creativity and originality  This place is an exact replica of Nandos  From the menu sauce and the bottle for the sauce tall rectangular bottle  Why cant they come up with something more original  I would still recommend people to come here and definitely be back again myself"

    "review":"This place is like a much MUCH better version of Bar Napoli As in they havent just been fined for various health and safety breaches but they still retain that friendly downtoearth authentic feel to it Alongside all the many overpriced eateries on or around George Street this place is a breath of fresh airBut there were a few things that niggled me when I ate in here recently Nothing huge but things like the fact that they cram in too many tables so youre constantly eavesdropping on other peoples conversations whether you like it or not And when its not busy the fact that there are so many tables means that youre overly aware of the fact that theres hardly anyone else ther Not really great for the atmosphere of itRant over this is still a good value Italian in a really convenient location Although it lacks some of the charm of the sister branch on Cockburn Street its still worth tryingI get a little wary of restaurants in the basement floor but this one looked so inviting I had to check out the menuIts yet another family owned Italian restaurant I used to wonder how they ever broke even with all this competition but they are businesses at the end of the day so Ill believe they know what theyre doingThe menu consists of the usual anti pasti soups pasta veal beef and sea food but I was really excited by the pizza prices which makes it hard to justify ordering Dominoes when I could get an authentic Italian pizza for 7This place is what it is: a cheesy Italian restaurant And sometimes after walking the sites of the city all day and the rain and cold you need an inexpensive Italian comfort meal And that is exactly what you will get here Service is friendly and attentive Food is good Decor is old world Italian and they play good musicwhat else do you need in a budget Italian eaterySecond visit to this restaurant First visit was a little underwhelming but I was willing to give it a second chance Wrong They were busy enough and they have many regular visitors that are being treated as family This enthusiasm was however not reserved for our group of 9 Our table like the first time was crammed and our number 9 seat was squeezed at the end Service is on a familiar basis and a little too much on the miss side an lesser on the hit side Granted our payable drinks were served promptly but we had request jugs of water twice before they were actually served The starter I took was the prosciutto and melon  the melon was tough The prosciutto was very good Main course was Spag Carbonara  to which I added mushrooms and that was made very well and good and creamy  I really enjoyed that Once that was finished we waited  table cleared and waited Until one of our group requested a dessert menu from a flyby waiter no no no  we should be offered not asked for  I ordered a banasplit as you dont get that very often these days in my experience a banana split is vanilla ice cream nuts banana and chocolate sauce  or if you will a dame blanche with banana Anyhow we were served a very colourful plate of 3 different flavoured icecreams vanilla strawberry chocolate  some green colouring and a variety of fruits that DO NOT BELONG in a banana split I did not ask for figs kiwis pineapple nor green apple This is NOT a fruit punch cocktail Coffee was served but no cookie or chocolates which we did got the first time I was there  so no consistency In the meanwhile the place was packing up and somehow we were left forgotten Several times we requested the bill which eventually came Nice of them to separate food  drinks  made the calculations easier I have now vowed not to go there any time soon as for the monies paid I could have had a much better experience in another establishment"

    "review":"Whenever I would walk past Inca there would always be a good atmosphere and almost always busy It was only natural that I paid it a visit to see what all the fuss was about From the outside the Italian mosaicstyle writing is really quaint and lures you in but I did not appreciate the harsh tiles on the inside and I dont know which mood the lighting was going for but it was near impossible to see my friends let alone my food When we asked for a candle we were told that there were problems with the electricity so probably shouldnt have an open flame This made us want to stayThe food was ok Average nothing special Im a traditionalist so opted for the Carbonara surprise surprise and it was quite tasteless To be honest it wasnt worth the calories My friend said she saw something black scutter across the floor at one point The restaurant seemed clean enough and everything was laid out well but there was something not quite rightIm a bit hesitant to report of my bad experience in Inca as it is always so busy so must attract custom from somewhere There must be an amazing dish that I havent heard about or something Im missing When I find it Ill let you know Until then stay clearI can only assume that everyone eating in here is eating here for the first time Otherwise I have no idea how this place can be as busy as it isI was meeting a group of friends in Bruntsfield to go out for something to eat and we were al in that really annoying mood where none of us could deide where to go After wandering around until we were all starving we decided to go for the good old failsafe Italian The cheap local pizzeria that always delivers or notThere wasnt a single thing on their menu that I hadnt seen before in an Italian which I thought was kind of boring The way I see it if you want a mediocre margherita or lasagne you can get a ready meal from the supermarket At least that way you wont pay almost 10 for itI have a simple theory for judging a restaurant or bar: always judge it on the basis of its loos and its house wine Unfortunately for Inca I can safely say that on the basis of these two criteria I will not be eating here again In fact I think the only reason I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1 is because we were all so ravenous by the time we got there that wed probably have eaten anythingInca seem to be confused over precisely which type of cuisine they are serving At first glance it would be easy to think that Inca was a Mexican restaurant but the food they serve is Italian Weird Having said that the atmosphere inside the restaurant is great as the staff are warm and inviting and make you feel at home straight away I ordered their four seasons pizza which was tasty had lots of toppings and cheese on it and it had a good crust on it  not too thin or burnt   Inca serves a range of pizza and pasta dishes as well as salads and garlic bread The food is very reasonably priced and they have a good selection of beers and wineI went to Inca on a Thursday night and it was fairly quiet inside but it is likely to be busier at the weekends I did find it fairly dark inside but  think the staff wanted to create an ambiance which is fine as long as you can see what you are eatingINCA SO SOUTH AMERICAN FOOD Wait Italian The food is as confused as the owners My Pizza Cardinale didnt know wither to be disgusting or burnt But Im going to give them the benefit of the doubt because my girlfriends meal looked alot better The meal took forever to come and the waitress was a little short with us The toilets were foul bleach is cheap guys come on Gloriously underwhelmingNow I havent eaten here so I cant comment on the food But this wee place does a very good cup of tea and the teapot is a good size and for the price its all fine and dandy But it is an odd place I thought the food would be Latin American of some description but its Italian and owned by a guy from Iran I think The restaurant has a large downstairs section so its much bigger than it appears from the outside Its a strange wee place in Bruntsfield with so much competition from other really nice places but seems to tick along regardless Maybe I can rereview when Ive eaten something but so far all is AOK if a little eclectic and odd :"

    "review":"The salad is good and the sandwich is tasty Hotchocolate with marshmallow is good looking but too sweet to finish allGood reasonable priced coffees and pastries Small quaint place with upper lounge to sit around and mingle social with other coffee connoisseurs I highly recommend to stop by and check it outAfter reading the rave reviews for The Caffeine Drip on Yelp I immediately began my walk to the other side of Edinburgh purely to visit this South African themed cafe We arrived on a Sunday morning and it was absolutely packed The staff were really friendly and let us know that there would be a long wait on food which doesnt bother me as long as Ive been informed So we sat and drank some coffees whilst waiting for our brunch First off the coffees are fine Nothing negative to say about them but also nothing positive It was just a coffee The food was good I opted for a sausage bacon and egg sarnie The sausage was the best bit but again it wasnt mind blowing Im not sure if I was overly critical because this place had been so overhyped but I was definitely underwhelmed It was good so dont let this review put you off going but dont expect fireworks because youll only get a sparkler at bestHuge club sandwiches really good milkshakes with super fun flavors Would definitely go again if not just for the great atmosphere and cool decorWe were here for breakfast on a Saturday it was a nice warm and cozy space away from the cold morning It has a fair bit of seating downstairs and despite being busy the noise was minimal The menu is quite extensive with lots of options including two vegan options I dont claim to be 100 vegan but I try to eat as vegan as I can so nice to have easy options You order at the counter which is situated next to a large range of treats all looks fairly enticing We ordered the savory french toast and I ordered the vegan hot pot with mushrooms We also ordered two long blacks The food to a while to come out but again they were busy so we were able to enjoy our coffees before our breakfast When it arrived mine was massive It came with two huge slices of sourdough toast The french toast was covered in cheese and had from what my partner said really tasty sausages I enjoyed my mushrooms and avocado although as it was vegan there was no spread on the toast and my preference would have been some hummus or chutney or something to make it a bit less dry but it still tasted nice and fresh All together it was around 20 for the two of us I would recommend this place for a hearty portion and a different tasting coffee They also do milkshakes and offer a few vegan options as well as a vegan hot chocolate which I was very tempted to tryDelicious Americano thats perfectly strong and black Nice staff and cozy with several floors and the main cafe in the cellar"

    "review":"Any chip shop can be a hit or a miss depending on when you go in but this chippy is genrally OK although they are very skimpy on the chipsAlways tasty here and the food is fresh Staff are pleasant and while the chips may not be the biggest portion in the world theres enough  and they do a larger portion for days when youre hungry Only downside is the mushy peas and gravy arent quite the same as in Lancashire but thats my personal tasteI had a craving for ham and pineapple pizza aka Hawaii Usually I order pizzas from La Favorita but I wanted to try something different as I was in a no frills mood and didnt care if the pizza was hand stretched and cooked in a log fire oven or whatever I just wanted a plain Hawaii pizza and fairly quickly as wellAnd that is what I got at Pierinos I paid 770 for a medium 12 pizza and after about a 10 min wait the pizza was ready and I strolled home to eat my dinner Well I wasnt disappointed The pizza was tasty and just right  basic stuff but just what I needed thenIm definitely going to revisit Pierinos again"

    "review":"Spice Box is a fantastic Thai takeaway and delivery service in the centre of Edinburgh The menu is a true reflection of the food of Thailand and comprises of dishes from all parts of the country Ordering via their website is really simple and you can pay using PayPal a genius idea that more places should catch on to Plus on Wednesdays they do a 10 deal for students comprising of a starter main and rice One of my favourite dishes is the chicken wrapped in pandanus leaves it really is excellent and is obligatory on any order of mine just remember to unwrap the chicken from the leaves before eating It is definitely not the cheapest takeaway around but the food is really fresh and healthy and everything is cooked to order In my opinion it is one of the best places to get Thai food from in Edinburgh a real restaurant alternativeOrdering food off the internet is going to ruin our society Not only is fast food fatty enough but now you dont even need to leave your chair to get it Heart attack at 40But with a place like Spicebox my death will be pushed back a few weeks Yes i did order it online which was really simple but I got something freshly prepared and reasonabley healthy I dont know how they did it but they got it to the other side of Edinburgh in less than 25 minutes A little expensive but great foodThai food is always the food that gets a raw deal when it comes to take aways  not many people instantly think of Thai when they want to kick back and forget about cookingSpice Box Im pretty sure is the one place that is going to change that The menu is a splendid selection of traditional and some modern thai dishes and they are absolutle always cooked to a consistant perfection  Ive never known anywhere like it to be always first classHowever Spice Box is relativly expensive if you dont take advantage of its deals so get it on a wednesday when it will be a lot kinder to your walletIve often seen the Spice Box advertised on a few websites for takeaway food so I decided to go and check it out Its a relatively small place but it holds its ownI get the impression that it has a bit of a cult following as on more than one occassion Ive met the same faces ordering their foodThe price is a bit hefty and to be honest the food isnt spectacular but its good nevertheless and worth a lookYes this place is a little more expensive than other takeaways in Edinburgh but you get what you play for The food is fresh and tasty rather than limp and greasy as are lots of takeaway restaurants They get to you in record time and you can order without  leaving your armchair all great points that make it worth paying a couple of extra pounds However if money is an issue god news for students is that they are extending the 10 Wednesday student offer to Tuesday and ThursdayWord of warning though they make their curries very spicy so unless you are a spicy food fiend stick to the mild optionSpice Box is one of the best Thai takeaways in Edinburgh The menu is huge with a massive choice of starters soups curries stir fries rice noodles and desserts All the dishes are cooked really well they are nicely spiced and flavoursome The duck and lychee curry is excellent as is the Pad Thai Pretty much all the dishes are available with chicken pork beef king prawns duck or vegetarian at varying pricesAdmittedly Spice Box is not too cheap but if you think about it most Thai places in Edinburgh are pretty pricey It can seem deceptively cheap but then you have to add meat onto the base price of each dish Also if you catch them on weekends then the wait is frequently up to and hour But the food is really good and worth it If youre bored of the same old Chinese rubbish then this is a really good alternative"

    "review":"Went to The Pompadour with my folks  Like the previous reviewers have mentioned the food was exquisite  I too had the Rabbit Ravioli and it was mighty fine  The decor is very high end but also a bit old school  The views from the dining room are goodThe one thing that did feel a bit cold was the service it did feel we were dining in the 1930s with way too many Sirs and Madames  it would do them a favour if they gauged their audience a bit better however I fear that they constantly expect the Michelin reviewer and act accordinglySo in summary the experience is as you would expect of this kind and price of restaurant  The food is excellent but the atmosphere is a bit more stuffy then it needs to beWeve been here once before and a wonderful fullmarks time This time they lost a star for a few quibbles Tonight was my birthdayFirstly the food was again exquisite My Skye crab avocado and melon gazpacho was the standout dish of the night  totally delicious perfectly balanced and very generously portioned in the crab department I didnt want it to endMy wifes rabbit caesar was also good Of our fishy mains my monkfish and langoustine raviolini was best with my wifes stone bass 2 pea and razor clam cannelloni coming v close second We couldnt do dessert because wed had a family lunch and were full so we opted to finish our wine and get the billNiggles were  we felt we waited too long firstly from being seated to actually getting menus Secondly too long to get starters and also to get mainsThirdly just the time between requesting the cheque and actually receiving it Not major issues but in an establishment with the volume of staff for silver service in a barely occupied place we missed the more irreverent informal but still professional service wed enjoyed on our previous visit which indeed was our reason for a returnOur biggest niggle was that on booking wed requested one of the 2 window tables overlooking the castle as it was a birthday We were told they were booked so NO Only one of them was occupied all night long which made us sad as wed coveted those tables and told friends about them etc since our first visitWe had a lovely night with each other and lovely food and only really felt let down by less memorable service and a requested table issue on a special occasion Id still recommend a visit for the pure value and quality to anyone GoOld school sumptuous setting Great foodBuuut the service was a let down  I think Grace summed up the entire experience rather poignantly in her review we had dinner there together I on the other hand rather enjoyed the lengthy descriptions about the wine if only because of the entertainment value My wine palette is just not developed enough to appreciate whichever famous wine grower grew the wine and in precisely what region of where it was grown I treated it as like a little story telling although wed forgotten the stuff he said at the beginning by the time he got to the end ok maybe they DID go on a little long  All of this not aided by the fact that he was so soft spoken you couldnt hear him half the timeStand out dish was the rabbit ravioli the rest of the food was good but I would expect nothing less from this calibre of restaurant And to be honest I was expecting a little more WOW Having stolen tastes of GSs wine pairing I think D  I were glad wed passed on the option and just chose a bottle of wine to go with dinnerAlso beware the after dinner drinks trolley as nothing is priced and imagine our surprise to find that our dram of whiskey cost the same as our bottle of wine All in all a fun night out but feel like I got a lot more bang for my buck at The Honours where wed been the month beforeThe Pompadour by Galvin is a restaurant I wouldnt normally have even noticed to be honest as its situated in hotel Waldorf Astoria but a recent voucher deal brought this place to my attention and I wanted to try it out I had high expectations and was I disappointed No I cant say I was but I perhaps expected some wow factor that wasnt quite there foodwise but it was still a great experienceFrom start to finish the staff at Pompadour were extremely welcoming and polite We started our dinner with canapes and a glass of champage The waiter came round with a basket of bread and it was very tastyFor starters I had pressed confit duck with wild mushrooms and smoked bacon It was full of flavour and absolutely delicious Second course arrived: loin and braised belly of pork with haricot blanc and roasted artichokes There was nothing wrong with it but the pork wasnt amazing The sauce was sticky maybe too sticky for my taste Im not a massive fan of white beans Having said that it was all tasty and I cleared my plateDessert was vanilla panna cotta with orange sauce and a pistachio biscotti The panna cotta had the perfect wobble and it was delicious Wines are very expensive at Pompadour There were some bottles of wine costing over 300 which to me is ridiculous We had a glass of wine 11 eachOn departure our lovely waiter handed me a little gift of scottish fudge I thought it was a lovely gesture and really shows how they care of their customersWe ate at Pompadour last night and can honestly say it was one of the best meals we have ever had The restaurant itself is absolutely stunning Classic elegance mixed with breathtaking views of Edinburgh Castle The quality of the staff was outstanding led by the assistant manager Hamish They were attentive to all of our needs and then some Hamish did it all and not just for us but for all the diners We were amazed by how he seemed to be involved in every aspect of the restaurant and accomplished each task at a level of excellence Will who I believe was the sommelier was also incredibly helpful The overall professionalism displayed by the staff was incredible As for the food it was simply amazing My girlfriend started with the Stuffed Loin of Ayrshire Rabbit while I had the Cured Foie Gras The dishes looked like pieces of art and tasted even better For mains she had the Slow Cooked Sirloin of Beef and I had the Breast of Duck These were without question two of the best dishes we have ever had Everything from the temperature of the meat to the seasoning was perfect Being a glutton I selected cheese from the trolley prior to desert I am convinced that Galvin restaurants have the finest selections of cheeses in the world and Pompadour did not disappoint For desert she had the Strawberry and Creamy Yoghurt and I had the Mango Souffl This was the perfect end to a perfect meal I cannot say enough about how much the service from Hamish and his team added to the overall experience  We have been to Galvin at Windows and Galvin La Chapelle and have had incredible service at each but the job done by the entire staff at Pompadour was in a league of its own We will certainly returnThis is my 100th review for 2014  its been a rideI so wanted to be impressed by this restaurant I read Jay Rayners review and the ones on Yelp and boy did I look forward to this Especially when we were able to use a voucher well we ARE the King  Queen of vouchers  The voucher was 29  for a 3 course seasonal menu and a glass of Galvin Champagne Much to our surprise we found the menu to have that exact seasonal menu to be 29 Huh  so we got a voucher and all we really got on this purchase was the glass of champagne Not to be disheartened we did realise that whether with or without the voucher we were still getting a fine dining meal for a reasonable price but seriously a voucher should present a significant discount Not just a free glass of bubbly rant over The restaurant is on the first floor of the WaldorfAstoria  The Caledonian at the west end of Princess Street On arrival we had the concierge to bring us up and the Maitre D took our reservation vouchers and coats We were led to our table shoed in and we took a good look at the surroundings and the menu The main feature is a massive rose quartz I think chandelier The rest of the dining room is a little Wedgewood  pale blues and off whites  Table decor is minimalist and functional There are understated Christmas decorations but not overly so The seasonal menu is 3 course affair with a choice of 2 Starter  2 Mains  2 Desserts We both took the same and I was impressed with the taste and craftsmanship of the dishesPressing of Confit Duck with Wild Mushrooms  Smoked BaconLoin  Braised Belly of Pork Haricot Blanc Roasted ArtichokeWhite Chocolate Pannacotta Orange Sauce Pistachio BiscottiWe also were presented with some hors doeuvres which were tasty but I cannot recollect what they were  As when tasting them I was looking at the wine list Mistake A decent glass of wine is 11  yes you read that right ONE glass I am sure there is a reason for this there should be  The service was impeccable the waiters explained the dishes and as a good restaurant does crumbed the table between courses We even got a parting gift box with Edinburgh fudge when we left now that is a nice touch In all I can actually recommend going here as you will be pleased with the dishes and if their seasonal menu prices hold you will be in for a treat"

    "review":"To me Chop Chop fills quite a unique space in the Edinburgh Chinese restaurant scene Rather than breaking he wide ranging menu in starters and main courses it offers most dishes in both small and large portions This lets you choose a much wider variety of dishes In true asian style these are delivered to your table as an when they are ready so It makes for a great group eating experience as everyone just tucks into whatever turns up next Dumplings are a speciality and come either fried or steamed Each of these comes in several different combinations of meat and veg The staff will happily show you how to mix up your own dumpling dipping sauce from soy sauce vinegar chilli an garlic but you can probably figure out how to do it yourself My last visit with work colleagues had us eating four kinds of dumplings spare ribs chicken wings fish balls in chilli sauce glass noodle salad sliced beef with garlic and spring onions and spicy noodles There wasnt a bit of food left on the table when we were done Chop Chops reputation seems to be growing steadily judging by how busy it was when we visited on a Tuesday night As their advertising caption saysCan a Billion People be wrongBar none Best Goyza Ive had outside AsiaThis visited was for someones birthday and it was my first time so double cause for celebration We ordered the buffet menu for over 12 people I think the waiters did a fine job getting all the dishes out one after the otherThe Sauvignon blanc was nice So pretty pleased the have a good wine Fell in love with the dumplings fried or boiled  they are all delicious The crispy squid was tasty too Quite chuffed at myself for using the chop sticks that were on hand instead of asking for cutlery I almost got the hang of it I think I will be back to get more dumplings very soonGreat place second time here and I must say it was much better than the first time We had a fee plates to share not on the all you can eat but just a share everything type of meal The squid is the best love it and cant stop eating it We also tried the Aubergine and cucumber salad as they got rave reviews but both are nothing to shoot about and wouldnt get them again The chicken wings are delicious I am addicted to chicken wings so these met my craving : We also shared a chow mein and some dim sum The three of us left satisfied but not too full and didnt feel like we have anything unhealthy greasy or heavy The service was good and it was full to the last table service was attentive and friendly but the waitress didnt understand us and it took some time to order The only reason i havent given 5 stars is the lack of main meal dish variety and the portion size is small I look forward to going backI have been to chop chop quite a lot over the years and it is always good  The staff are really nice but the service can be a little slow  Tonight especially the service was slow  We knew that food comes out at different times but my other halfs main food arrived well after I had finished mine  At this point he had eaten a lot of rice and dumplings so was fairly full  Having said this they clearly realised it was slow as gave us a free rice at the same time to apologise for the wait I really appreciated this as I was hungry even if my other half was not  The food really is tasty The boiled dumplings especially the pork and coriander  are lovely  If you are in a group I would recommend the banquet  You can just order more of what ever dish you like  At the end of the day as their slogan says: can a billion people be wrongTraveling to Scotland I was told to go to Traveling to Edinburgh I was told to try the best chinese restaurant in Scotland Chop Chop  However I was unable to find this out because they didnt honor our reservations  We were told to come back in an hour and they MIGHT have a table for use  We might have done this if we hadnt had the SAME experience the night before at this restaurant  WHY talk reservations if you dont honor them"

    "review":"Dcor atypique et haut en couleurDes viandes trs bien cuites et trs tendres mais des portions un peu justeI was on holiday with my boyfriend We were at Edinburgh for a couple of days doing tours We stumbled upon this place what a happy surprise First time we came the place was packed The server told us it would be about 10 or 15 minutes she was closing a ticket and they should be leaving soon No problem She recommended that we go two doors down at Castle Arms for a drink and we thought why not We returned and the table was ready for us Now the food My boyfriend had the haggis for appetizer and supper I had oyster for starter and fish for supper I tried the haggis for the first time It was creamy and good Delish  We ordered a bottle of wine and shared a pudding for desert The owner came by our table to serve us the food Server says hes a hard worker I can tell he takes pride in his restaurant We were happy with the first visit we came returned the next day The only con i could think of is the toilet There is only 1 ladies room and on the second night  someone took their time If Im ever in Edinburg again I will definitely come back for another haggisCame here with my family during my wedding weekend The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating seeing as every other restaurant nearby was extremely busy and had no room for our large party I ordered a chicken entree which was extremely tasty The rest of my family all ordered various items off the menu and everyone agreed that our food was good Good food and great service is all I need when I visit a restaurant and this place deliveredThis was a sad experience   The entry is nicely painted staircase with lively graffitti  The inside looks cozy with exposed brick walls and wine bottles with dripping candles to add to the ambiance  We asked to eat on the terrace  That was probably our mistake   The waitress didnt came back after we said we needed a minute  The guy waiting on us seemed to be the chef   The food took a while to come out and then was bland and cold   It was pretty though  Just wish it tasted as good as it lookedInitially very impressed by the place but then turned into an average experience in the end You come down into a lovely cave like place with nice moody lighting The food was pretty good but the service not particularly friendly and the place was too cold so I had my jacket on the whole time Certainly cannot fault the speed of the arrival of foodprobably arriving worryingly fast for what we had Hoping it wasnt microwaved All in all an okay place but absolutely nothing to shout about unfortunatelyBland overcooked overpriced   The overall 3 rating is too generous  I should have checked first before I wandered into this dump"

    "review":"Back today for the fourth time cant fault this little gem will continue to go back and enjoy the great food relaxed atmosphere and friendly staffwhat can I say I cannot fault this place The food is incredible staff are really lovely and so helpful great atmosphere and really pretty reasonable prices and BYOB I will be back time and time againMy biggest problem when I eat out is that I generally wanna eat everything Which is why I love tapas mezze and sharing platters  you really can sample it all in Pera  we opted for the cold mezze to share and the mixed hot mezze and hoped wed still have room to share the lamb kofte  but we really didnt  next timePera is a very relaxed place its interior is simple and understated small in size so id recommend making a booking esp if you are more than 4 people The kitchen looks tiny and its a little odd when you go to the bathroom  but what it lacks in polished style and grandeur it really does make up for in flavours Plenty to choose from and loads of vegetarian options  feels like authentic Turkish cuisine  probably the best humous I have ever tasted And such combinations of so many herbs and spices  sensational Everything just bursting with flavour and colour  just wish I couldve eaten moreIt is also open for breakfast and lunch and I noticed they have specials till 5pm 895 for 2 courses Will definitely be back  next time with elasticated trousers"

    "review":"Quality Italian food in nice surroundings with helpful and efficient staff nice choice off the menu and a good example of how to keep regular customers local and visitors alike Food is of a high standard with all the regular dishes you might expect from a good Italian restaurant Homely food rather than fancyOwner always seems on hand if any queries or requests Can be a bit noisy when the place is full  which is often  but to me thats a sign of a good time being enjoyed Next door take away also offers carry outs if you fancy a meal at home Certainly worth a visitAl Borgo is a lovely little familyrun Italian restaurant near my Mums house because of its locality we go there as a family quite a lot We are always greeted warmly by the staff and the service is faultless The menu has all the usual Italian suspects but theyve been doing this for years so theyve got the classics down to a tee This is where I first tried Calamari and it has since become a firm favourite of mine Its one of those dishes that really does rely on the quality of the ingredients and the skill of the chef the batter is always light and crispy and the squid is never chewy or rubbery perfect If ever you pass by in the evenings the place is full of happy diners The people in the west of Edinburgh are very lucky to have this place on their doorstepFirm favourite  Menu not overly extensive good choice so means food is quality  Great staff very friendly I like that the continue to ask if you need anything I find in some places they serve food and forget to refill drinks  They have always found space for us last minute and space for the babies I have had over the years growing into small children"

    "review":"Around lunch time expect to find Nikkis packed with the local business elite  Theres a good reason why though: the service is rapid and the sandwiches are all above averageSalami Jarlsberg Tomato  Mayo was my choice and at 220 the price isnt bad eitherA minimal sitting area and swathes of the afore mentioned clientele ensure its not an ideal place to sit and eat rather a strict takeaway optionAs Sam said its not the ideal place to sit since there isnt much room and  they only have barstools  However I went in around 1pm and I was able to sit and eat my lunch comfortably  I like that they make everything to order and they have a good selection of things to add to your sandwich potato etc  I also like the fact that they use eggs and potatoes from a local farm too  Anyway the main factor is that my soup was really good and my husbands panini was also really tastyNikkis is something of a West End institution It will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year I stopped in for a quick breakfast roll of the haggis variety and was suitably pleased by my choice Judging by the amount of available floorspace theyre used to managing significant queues at lunchtime which is no surprise as its a friendly wee place with an excellent range of lunchtime optionsOverall we said: I was impressed with Nikkis The welcome was as warm as youre likely to find and their haggis roll was as good as Ive sampled Im happy to now consider this place as my go to breakfast roll place as and when I require such sustenance on the way to work Id happily recommend you pay them a visit too as their deli counter looked really good and their daily specials sounded very temptingFor what it is : a sandwich shop With the different options of bread they have many varieties of fillings Although not the cheapest they are willing to take on unusual requests like a croissant with ham and fried egg I do find that with larger orders they tend to mix them up wrong bread type or not use the correct sauce But I can understand that The service has always been OK a bit stretched at times  A nice touch is that they have a Scone of the day and you pay a few pence less for that They do good business in the West End During Breakfast and lunch times it get really busy so you can better phone in your orderNikkis plays a not inconsiderable role in my magnificent corpulence A huge baked potato with chili and cheese for under 4 will not only harden the arteries cause obesity and make you sleepy in the afternoon BUT it is also exceptional good value for money and tasty as bacon on a sugar stick Nikkis truly is epic and enjoys a massive daily trade if you want a spud come early otherwise you will be forced to have one of their splendid sandwiches or even worse one of the other specials such as curry and rice which will fatten you as much as the spudsGreat place for lunch Fresh sandwiches and a good selection of hot options too which vary dailyIve not tried any of the quiches or salads yet but they look pretty goodGood friendly service and pretty cheap too Cant really ask for much more"

    "review":"Ancien htel le Three Sisters est un grand pub sur Cowgate situ dans un  btiment traditionnel cossais de pierre au cur de la vieille ville Lorsque lon rentre on est impressionn par la taille de ltablissement On y est all en plein aprs midi donc difficile de se rendre compte de lambiance quil peut y avoir ici le soir Il dispose galement dune grande terrasse sur laquelle sont diffuss les match de rugby Ils ont un choix de bire pression et galement de quoi se restaurer Lendroit doit attirer beaucoup dtudiants Cest un endroit idal pour faire la fte et sortir le soir  EdimbourgBest described as a hole The downstairs bar has always been one of the citys busier establishments but last night I was directed upstairs for the first time as every man  his dog was out pretending to have Irish connections myself included Thus I discovered the sticky floored delight of Maggies Chambers Do they not employ cleaners with mops or do they soak those mops in booze rather than soap  water The toilets are wholly inadequate for the size of the potential crowd in the place  18 for 5 Jagerbombs albeit with a free coke thrown in is ludicrous Paradoxically the music was probably the best I heard all night but otherwise theres absolutely no reason to give this place any businessNice place to hang outside listen to the loud music and people watch  There were are least 4 stag  hen parties there while I was therealong with a group of guys all dressed as Elvis  Fun place to have a few drinks and a few laughs If you are looking for a quiet pub this is not your placeNever seen any pub quite like this one Our group was drawn in by the outdoor patio for dancing Very spacious and you will get plenty of air Finally a place to dance without a roof and no stuffy air There were plenty of people here and the mood was high energy The drinks are little pricey but we didnt pay cover to get in so it balanced outThe Three Sisters should be really good its central its massive its got a huge beer garden and they have a good range of beers at the bar But it never quite lives up to this and is overall a pretty average place The interior is really dark to the point that its a hassle to walk anywhere you have to kind of feel your way towards things Also for the size there a remarkably few seats meaning you spend the vast majority of your time standing about which is always a bit of a pain The worst part of it though are the people that go in there Its always full of chavs and on a weekend you feel like any minute a mass brawl is going to break out It can be quite intimidating and theres always a bit of anger just simmering under the surfaceIt does have its good points though The bar sells a good range of beers wines and ciders as well as all the major spirits The garden is probably the best feature it is absolutely massive for a pub During the summer its a really good place to have a few drinks outside or sometimes theres a big screen showing sports At the moment during the festival they have a Crabbies garden in there as well which is always a good thing in my bookSince Three Sisters opened I have had absolutely no compunction to walk through their doors There is absolutely no reason I felt to come in here  a non descript generic bar with no defining qualities to make me feel at home here Too big too many chavs Well now I have to take all of that back because I spent a long time getting quite quite hammered and watching fringe shows here last Monday It was open late served me alcohol long past when I deserved to still be drinking and had an open courtyard where I could sit in the pouring rain talking to cute boys I think in terms of pubs I still prefer small and cozy over big and grandiose but I see the Three Sisters in a new warmer more welcoming light than my prior judiciousness"

    "review":"Wandered in here on a whim with my fiance after a failed attempt to get dinner at another place near it and boy were we floored The decor is absolutely stunning and the atmosphere is decidedly upscale and classy We were greeted by a lovely woman who later identified herself as the wife of the owner who was incredibly warm and attentive to our table all evening The menu features a good mix of Thai and Indian dishes All of them sounded so good that it was difficult to make a decision In the end we decided on the Mintleaf Special for a starter the Gaeng Keow Warn and the Panang All of them were extraordinary By far some of the best Asian food Ive found in Edinburgh Make sure to try the coconut rice As someone who is not a huge fan of rice this stuff might be my new favourite thing Its so sticky and creamy The staff were all very friendly and after the owners wife heard we were getting married she was kind enough to show us their upstairs function rooms and explain how having an event there works She really went above and beyond for us and was so friendly the entire time For anyone looking for a beautiful space to have a meal or event at I would highly recommend Mintleaf Well definitely be backI was a bit skeptical of eating at a place that serves Thai and Indian but this place was phenomenal  The flavors were excellent and the staff was very courteous  I will definitely dine here again when Im in EdinburghBei einem Besuch in Edinburgh stieen wir auf dieses interessante RestaurantDas Ambiente ist geschmackvoll  und auergewhnlich gestaltet obwohl es uns etwas zu dunkel war Am Eingang wurden wir freundlich empfangen und gleich zu einen Tisch begleitetDie Essen war gut obwohl es nicht ganz meinen Geschmack trafNicht ganz so gut hat uns die Sauberkeit der WC Anlage gefallenAuch die eine Bedienung wirkte im Nachhinein eher desinteressiert whrend die zweite weibliche Bedienung sehr aufmerksam und hilfsbereit war Alles in allem ist es ein gutes RestaurantThis restaurant has changed hands a few times over the years but I hope this one sticks because its lovely The owners have form having come from the successful Mya Indian  Thai restaurant down the road on Commercial street Although the decor is for now largely unchanged from the buildings previous incarnation as Amani the kitchen and other facilities have been completely replaced  a move which suggests the new owners have their priorities rightThis seems to be confirmed by the quality of the food which was splendid on the night I went Both the Indian and Thai sides of the equation stood up to scrutiny in terms of the ingredients and preparation The Tom Yum Gai starter was spoton: delicate and fresh but packed with flavour to line you up for the main course The only slight very slight let down was the chicken panang which was a tiny bit insipidThe service was really great  very friendly and nice chat The owners dont drink so after the meal we were all invited to try a couple of new wines they were considering adding to the list which is incidentally pretty impressiveIll definitely go back soon  and take a few more people so I can try out more of the menu"

    "review":"We booked a table on a voucher for 2 people and they were happy to use the voucher for 4 peopleThe deal was for 12 tasting sizes containing of 6 cold and 6 warm Meze In addition we ordered extra fried calamari tzaziki and an artichoke with dry roasted tomatoes It was all a bit of a mixed bag as each one of us preferred different dishes My personal favourite was the calamari which was nicely crispy outside and soft on the inside and not chewy like you get in some other places The ambiance is a bit bare but the music created a great compensation for that We noticed that we were humming along while enjoying the dishes in front There is a good level of noise as we didnt have to over shout the music either Service was very friendly but a little chaotic It took us 3 requests to actually get the bill to our table They closed the kitchen at 9pm so we decided to have coffee and dessert elsewhere  That was actually fine with me as I didnt fancy any of the dessert on the menu So in all it was a good experience and there were some definite highlights but it lacked that cohesion and finesse to make it stand outMeze Me Full and Call Me IkramThis place is great really really good Turkish food at a great price with top notch service We got booked in over the weekend of the Calcutta Cup a table for 4 is hard to come by on those weekends and my mum managed to book it on the dayA few drinks beforehand in one of the many awesome bars on Hannover Street and empty tummies were in need of satisfaction Friendly welcome dont be put off by the guy at the door handing our Hummus Canaps its not a sign of desperation as the place was half full and there were a lot of regulars The menu is huge so we were quite relieved when the lady came over and said that they do set menu for 20 a head and bring over a selection of stuff  which is taking the pain out of group eating in a Meze restaurant  ok we will take 4 of those and 2 bottles of red wine thanks The cold stuff came super quick plenty of warm pitta bread to mop up copious amounts of hummus sliced sausage aubergine and tomato and other dishes which I cant remember Hot stuff started coming before we were done there with calamari chicken feta and spinach pastries and hot vegetable dishes also I know what most of these are called in Greek but not in Turkish sorryThe finale was the main course and we got a platter of succulent chicken kebabs as well as a huge pitta stuffed with freshly cooked lamb  that really was 10 out of 10Ok so why isnt this 5 star because it wasnt the most amazing Mediterranean food I have ever it had its strong 4 star with definite 5 star elements My dad started speaking nonsense to the manager who gave him a voucher for a comp bottle of wine next time we are in  thanks Dad seeing as you live in Aberdeen Ill be taking thatBoomWent in on a lastminute night free for dinner as the rest of Hanover St was busting full and ordered 7 items between 2 of us and some wine Generally quite a deflating experienceThe chicken wings were really tasty had proper good flavour and crunchy outside but they were no bigger than my thumb and mostly legs not wings Small but good A ribeye salad was good and tasty with fresh herbs the only dish containing fresh herbs actually The hummus with lamb was void of flavour and we had to add a tonne of salt and lemon juice to make it decent We also had prawns which were again tiny I always get so disappointed with these wee tiny prawns  if youre emulating a holiday in Greece or Turkey type meal then you should use better produce than thatAnyway the buttery lemony garlicky sauce they were swimming in came in handy for adding flavour to the other dishes that were bland The thin sliced chicken on top of soggy pitta with tomato sauce was very passatafromacarton tasting The prawn butter improved it Pitta garlic bread with cheese was lovely hot but after 5 minutes become inedible And the fatoush was terrible worst Ive ever hadService was ok not slow or anything but lacked a sparkle of some kind We had the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu and the bill for 2 came to 70 which is really quite steep for very plain nibbly food in a stark uninteresting environment and we were only there an hour I guess you takes your chances in city centre on a busy Saturday nightAll in all nothing special going on here Wont be back or recommendingThis was our first time at Yeni and we were very pleasantly surprised We had a mix of hot and cold Meze plates The bruschetta was excellent as were the traditional Turkish dishes like hummus and grilled strips of cheese i forget the name The service was excellent and the prices lowThis was the best meal weve had in Edinburgh Dont miss itAh tapas Loads and loads of tiny food My favourite things Pretty much always experiencing food envy every time I eat out as I find it impossible to choose just one dish from a menu tapas is the perfect remedy to tackle this Id never tried Greek tapas before so this was a pleasant first Dining on a Saturday evening at 5:30 our party of 10 made good use of the excellent pre theatre option  three tapas plus dessert for 1495 I however chose from the a la carte as I absolutely had to choose the grilled halloumi which was not on the pre theatre menu I also close the hummus kavurma with lamb which was absolutely amazing Whats more baskets of hot pitta bread is complimentary so there are no more hidden costs My dish however falafel was disappointing very dry and there wasnt much taste at all We also ordered the prosecco at 21 which was superb as well as reasonably priced There is so much more Id love to try on the menu so I will definitely keep this one in mind next time I visit the capitalWe last ate here some 1617 years ago when it had a different name  we were happy to see it still operating upon our recent visit to Edinburgh  the original Turkish restaurant however was a level far above what we recently experiencedThe food was okay  nothing particularly spectacular  thus were unlikely to return"

    "review":"AVOIDPrevious experiences of KFC had made us wary but the good reviews on this site lulled us into a false sense of security The food was okay but the place was filthy A rather unpleasant mob of young people fortunately left soon after we came in The staff had closed off half of the restaurant to clean it but we refused to eat in the other half until they cleared the tables which were all stacked with debris There was food on the seats and on the floor The staff were nice enough and I was sorry for them that they had so many messy customers but clearing up on a regular basis did not seem to be part of their routine Not a pleasant experienceRight next door to the over rated Krispy Kreme KFC is situated at Hermiston Gate at the end of the M8 Its a good KFC and the Zinger Tower burger was delish They have stopped doing the Hot Shots which is a real shame I liked themWELL WELL WELL  this is my first EVER time visiting a KFC EVER  It was clean and staff were friendlyI choose the Chilli chicken wrap which was around a 1  it was tasty and a had a small hit of sweet chilli    Its just another fast food chain but the wrap was nice as it was a quick filler as i was on the go that morningthis kfc I cant fault it The staff are always friendly helpful and the place is never been unclean when me and my family have been in Not only that but they always remember my wee girl and we are not in often at all"

    "review":"Yes the food does indeed taste good but they make you wait for it I had to wait for an hour when I ordered But to be fair it was Friday evening and as the food is really tasty I imagine that they are inundated with people calling making orders When the food did come the packaging must be the most fancy that I have seen from any takeaway shop and is a real nice touch Me and a few friends ordered some prawn crackers between us but we found that they were pretty greasy the sweet and sour pork I had with fried rice was however very tasty and not at all stodgy or greasy and all of my friends enjoyed the meals they had and found it very fillingI definitely recommend a trip here and will be ordering from Taste Good again as the food is great and the prices are very reasonable just be prepared to wait for itThis is my local Chinese take away and Ive never been disappointed It has a great selection of starters that are always cooked perfectly crispy and never soggy like some takeaway options can beEven the packaging of their take away boxes and bags are nice and its these little extra touches along with the tasty food that keep it at the top of my take away listThis Chinese restaurant and takeaway has chosen a very fitting name for itself because the food really does taste good The modern and stylish decor sets it apart from most other Chineses in Edinburgh: think clean lines blocks of colour and lots of glass wood and metal They do manage to back up all the style with some substance though: the food is yummy Back in the day when I dabbled with vegetarianism the follies of youth I insisted on coming here for the Hot Spicy Bean Curd These days as a fully fledged carnivore I am more likely to order the Shredded Beef with Chilli but both dishes are equally tastyI wouldnt necessarily head all the way over to Slateford road to visit this place but if I was on this side of town and I fancied a Chinese I would most definitely go to Taste GoodDefinitely the best take away Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh but its been over a decade since we were at the restaurant We ended up having pretty much the same as our take aways but it tasted even better Service was great and we got a table no problem even though it was during the Festival Loved itAs part of continuing my search for a local Chinese my roommate recommended this one As I am a veggie maybe I missed the real flavour of the BBQ and meat options which might make this place special but overall there was just something missing Our local Chinese in Leith was so amazing I knew it would be hard to beat but this definitely didnt come closeI had a Spicy Bean curd which was nice but wasnt enough on its own with rice to really make a good dinner We got some noodles which tasted fine but nothing special and definitely didnt make the top of my list due to them being sort of flavourless You have to spend 26 to get free prawn crackers which is pretty steep in my mind The spring rolls were really good good size and very tasty but were almost 4 for just 2 I think we could have made better at home for that priceOverall it is a bit overpriced for what you are getting which isnt much I would rather go further to find a better local then eat here again Although it is absolutely fine if you just want some basic Chinese Maybe I didnt try the right things but it didnt wow meTaste Good is my local Chinese  I not only go there because its nearby but also because its good  Although I have to admit that I may not be very objective as I only ever order the same dishes which I really like These are: the  Singapore noodles the Special chow mein and the King Prawn Szechuan  My flatmate is a big fan of their spicy shredded beef which tastes nice but lacks vegetables for me Its best to go and pick up as it takes much less time than getting the food deliveredI have visited the restaurant downstairs before they have a very nice mussels dish that is not on the takeaway menu which I strongly recommend  A bit dark down there though"
