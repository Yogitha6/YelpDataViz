    "review":"Bought a groupon and decided to try the place outParking: First there is no parking lot it is all on street parking which was fine because it was after 7 and we didnt have to put money into the metersAmbience:Great design and layout of the location brick walls wooden booths old wine bottles on wallService:Absolutely terrible We never got refills on our water or soda We received the food and never asked if we needed anything Had to go to the waitress to ask her for red pepper flakes The other waitress was kissing some guy a few times and she never came over either I didnt even try to get management as the lady who looked to be the manager was texting on her phone the entire time and looked uninterested in helping tablesFood:We ordered the pizza and it was absolutely awful Think 5 antoons pizza in oakland The middle completely fell apart And the pizza was over topped I never thought you could put too many toppings on a pizza But it must have been close to a pound of hot peppers on it and this pizza crust couldnt manage to hold it all together Overall:I will never come back to hereOrdered side salad with house Italian dressing fresh  good  Chicken parm sandwich needed a bit more sauce but unfortunately the waitress was nowhere to be found  nor was she around when our drinks ran out which in my opinion should never happen Atmosphere is cool i really want to give a higher rating but the service really took away from the experience that it could have been If Im in the area again I will give it another shot in hopes that the service is betterfood was a lot better when they first reopened if you want something good order stuffed banana peppersGreat little Italian joint with a nice bar and patio Fills a needed niche in the West End Sunday is jazz day on the patio RecommendIm really not sure how this place ended up with 4 stars because I was struggling to give it two   Service at the bar dragged it up but thats about all that I have positive to say about the place   I went there for a wine and coloring book event but had dinner at the bar first  It was warm in the bar but even warmer sweltering really in the restaurant section  The food was freezer fare that they made an attempt to dress up a little  The buffalo chicken wrap had potential but the thin buffalo sauce leaked all out of it and it ended up a big soggy greasy mess  The lettuce on it was questionable as well  The sweet potato fries were passable and were served with apple butter which was a nice touch  Its still freezer food though  I also found it really odd that they were filling their ice wells with 20 lb bags and were serving soda from 2 liter bottles Once I moved to the dining area I wasnt sure which was worse  the sweltering heat or the entertainment  At first we thought what is with this music selection  The bar was playing contemporary country and this was stuff my grandparents would have listened to  Then we thought hmmmthis version of the song really sounds like bad karaoke   After looking around we see a guy out on the patio with a karaoke machine   Ohthat explains it  It IS bad karaoke   30 minutes later though we thought why is this same terrible guy still up there  And then he pulled out a trumpet and clearly it wasnt just karaoke night  this was the intended entertainment  YikesGreat addition to the West End neighborhood Food is always good and the service is wonderful When I go local this is where I head to"

    "review":"We came for lunch on Memorial Day and had an excellent lunch outside  It wasnt busy but wasnt dead by any means which Im sure changes on game days  We shared chips and guac I had their pinot grigio and Bobby had a Dos XX  Chips were fresh and guac was super flavorful  I ordered their Mexican cobb salad with the chipotle ranch and Bobby had the chicken burrito  Honestly our food was really good and it was shocking because we have been to the Shadyside location twice and both times the food was absolutely awful  We will only eat at this location from now onService was great and we had no complaints  I assume the lack of consistent service mentioned in other reviews is because they are still new and establishing a routine in such a busy area  Hopefully they get it together however we had no issuesTypical Mexican style food appetizers ok Speciality tacos made the visit though recommend the brisket tacos and the chorizo tacosGreat service   Went before a Pirates game  Fun atmosphere and the food was great  Very authentic fresh Mexican food  Carnitas were great and the habanero salsa was spicy but so delicious  Would highly recommendFirst of all I love Mexican food and Mexican restaurants  authentic or generic The vibe in any Mexican restaurant is always fun Ive been to the location in the Southside before a pens game and had a pretty good time I was anxious to get my hands on another lime yinzeritalime margarita with a corona beer bottle added in the mix However we were seated within seconds of arriving but we sat and waited at our table for 10 minutes with no service Three waitresses walked past our table many times and they made many glances but no one ended up acknowledging us Total bummer We decided to leave Maybe another time maybe notWould love to recommend but do not at this time"

    "review":"I loved this place The atmosphere was quirky but in a good way The staff and service were great and the food was the best part We live in San Francisco and are constantly seeking good Italian food and this place definitely fulfilled our expectations when we were home in Pittsburgh for the holidaysPhenomenal food portions and service Great ambience  This is fourth time here and have never been disappointed   I have tried a new dish each time and always tastefully done Portions are very large and always end up taking half home Cherries Jubilee is very tasty and my favorite dessert of three testedThe decor at this place is definitely strange yet it will absolutely capture your attention  From the beautiful stained glass to the plethora of swords the wall decorations will definitely provide for interesting conversationDespite the kitchy decor mismatched chairs and tablecloths  the food was fantastic and the service was attentive  From the scallops to the rack of lamb my family enjoyed everything that we ordered  Its nice that all of the entrees come with garlic bread and a saladWhen Im back in Pittsburgh Id definitely return  My only concern: we were there on a  Saturday night and the place was pretty empty  I know its a little off the beaten path but I wonder how its going to keep survivingGreat food great people I would come back to Pittsburgh just to eat here My friend and I were driving across country and this place came highly recommended from a Pittsburgh local We arrived close to closing they seated us were extremely friendly and courteous to us Owned by a family you can tell this is the sort of honest family owned restaurant that is hardly seen anymore The food was exceptional The cook is the owners daughter in law and the food is among if not the very best Italian food Ive ever had The salad course had an exceptional balsamic dressing the lasagna was without fault I am not a guy who usually eats lasagna but this was out of this world The owners son was bartending and comped us an exceptional dessert drink of his own concoction which was a surprising blend of what I can only imagine was Kahlua and Baileys Irish CreamPlus this place had a lot of local history behind it Originally called the Electric Banana Club this place was a hotbed of punk rock activity in the 1980s Even though its now a very traditional Italian restaurant you have to appreciate a place that has that much character and history We only stopped by but youd be hard pressed to find Italian food this good anywhere in the country Do yourself a favor and stop byBest tiramisu Ive ever had hands down A little pricer than I expected but very worth the price Husband loved the rack of lamb If youre staying nearby you should try itThis place is really good  What made it from 4 star to 5 star was the family devotion and effort which really shines through  As for the food it was really good and plentiful  We also ordered way too much  I will return soonI did return not nearly as good as the first time I went"

    "review":"I have not been to the restaurant yet but I have ordered takeout twice and can attest to my experience with their food The first time I ordered the burger slider appetizer as I could not decide on what burger to get It was not special and the burger pieces on the sliders while I assumed that they would be small were very tiny and practically over cooked For the price I absolutely should have gotten a full size burger The order of tater tots was pretty good The spices on them were different and yummy The second time I ordered a Fire in the Hole burger which is a spicy burger with guacamole jalapeos pepper jack cheese chipotle aioli and Sriracha It was delicious My only complaint is that I would have still liked lettuce on my burger and it did not come with lettuce so I ended up adding some from my own refrigerator So three stars for one good experience and one disappointing experience Overall I was disappointed with their menu as they have very few burgers actually on the menu I understand that you can build your own burger that has infinite possibilities but I like when they have a lot of made up combinations of burgers ones their chefs have perfected versus me trying to make up a yummy burger and jacking it upMy review will not differ too drastically from other reviewers and thats a shame I was expecting so much more from BRGR after hearing all the hype and particularly after witnessing friends get in arguments over which customizable burger establishment is better BRGR or Burgatory For me the answer is clear and sadly that answer is Burgatory I was in with a friend visiting from out of town so we kept it simple since we had a lot of catching up to do Nothing beats being able to eat a burger with one hand and gesture with the other hey good friends let good friends talk with their mouths full I ordered the Double Yoi burger which if you know anything about Pittsburgh is an aptlynamed tribute to Myron Cope that echoes a Primanti Brothers sandwich It came with pastrami thousand island dressing cole slaw and the part I was looking forward to most the egg on top When you go to a nice burger joint and you get an egg on top nothing beats cutting or biting into it and seeing or feeling the extravagant hot yolk drip down the sides Thats what I was expecting I am doing the lowcarb thing so in my case I ordered it without the bun and I was ready to see that glorious yolk cascade down my giant stack of meat WAY disappointed It was practically overhard OVERHARD NO yolk drippage at all I was almost offended And on top of it my medium well burger was cold in the middle The pastrami was dried out I understand cooking temperatures well enough to know that a medium well burger shouldnt be icy in the middle I know from being a line cook too that that means my food was probably sitting at the expo station for way too long under a heat lamp Neither my friend or I specifically communicated to our waitress that we would like our order of chips with crack dip Ill touch on that in a moment to come out first but it IS an appetizer and to me she should have at least asked She did not and I was a surprised when our food which already took quite a while to leave the kitchen came out with the chips side by side It could have been handled better So back to the crack dip I spent 425 on a basket of fresh fried chips that I shouldnt have eaten which WERE delicious crisp and salty just to try the crack dip that comes with it Our waitress explained that its a todiefor item and its reminiscent of a chilicheese concoction I think it has Sriracha in it too so I was all on board It came out in a 3 oz souffle cup haphazardly tucked under some chips It tasted like a combination of CheezWhiz and canned chili you can get at the dollar store Sadly I was not impressed for the second time that evening All in all BRGR does have a lot going for it It has a fun unique menu with lots of addons and many ways to customize your burger The decor is beautiful and welcoming The wait was less than expected The staff was pretty friendly I fully understand that sometimes you go to a place and theyre having a busy night Things go wrong Ive worked in a kitchen for years believe me I know how that is But I cant help but feel that everything was so lackluster that I wouldnt want to spend the time money and effort of driving to the South Hills to try it again Ill be sticking to Burgatory for my burger needs from now onI went here because my coworker swore by it and still swears by it but I will never go back My fiance and I went in one evening and were able to be seated right away which was great Then our waitress came by and asked if we had ever been before and we said no She just kind of shrugged it off like oh oh well youre here now When it came time to order I told her I have an onion and onion powder allergy so I had a few options picked out and asked if any of them would be able to be made without the onion or onion powder She told me no and that my only option was absolutley no seasoning without even attempting to make it look like she would check with the kitchen for me Not even a would you like salt and pepper as an option I was a waitress for 6 years and I know how demanding people can be but she didnt even attempt to make it look like she cared she just wanted to be done with us We got our food obviously it was bland and tasteless and she never tried to see if there was anything she could do for us to make it betterAll in all the food normally is probably better but the unenthusiastic service leaves such a bad taste in your mouth its hard to tellBRGR is fast becoming my favorite locally ownedburger place everHave had only enjoyable experiences thereMark and Kristi at the bar couldnt have been more helpfulkind and professionalSandy was great tooand they just got slammed with customersWe were treated so wellthe food is absolutely one of the things you HAVE to try in your lifetimeI crafted my owngrass fedbearnaise aiolifresh mozzarellabeansprouts and mushrooms on a brioche and for me it was perfectionGreat atmosphererelaxed with familyjust very cool vibeI know there are other locations toothis one was the closestAnd I want to say againthese guys  are locals Lets support themSo farI only had my crafted one 2cebut plan on going back and trying the Pad Thai burgerGrazed and Confused and some saladsCannot go wrong with this place Give them a try You wont be disappointedI was here opening week so hopefully things have improved since then A very friendly and knowledgable manager was training a less than happy server so our service was very odd I was also told I could have mac n cheese made with special sauce since Im a vegetarian and it was not at all as described The shakes are good but their strong alcoholic ones are still a little too sweet and sugary for me I think they should have a stiff option that actually tastes like booze instead of candy But thats understandable The cheesy tots are probably my favourite thing on the menu  totally get it instead of fries as an appPaid 60 dollars for two burgers three milkshakes and fries and cheese This included tip Service was okay The burgers were not very flavorful We were really excited to try it but left disappointed We wont be back Im an avid cook and make much better burgers at home"

had and I dont know why Its just salmon  spinach and Swiss cheese but its incredibly good  It must have something to do with how the ingredients were prepared and how the omelet was cooked I cannot replicate this dishIve been here several times and the food has always been excellent  interesting and worth the calories They also have a great wine list Do not come here if youre tight on time This is a casual little French cafe with a tiny kitchen that prepares all dishes from scratch when ordered Nothing is prepackaged or frozen therefore it takes more time for the entrees to arrive than it does at most restaurants As long as you are expecting this  you will probably have a great experience besides  its an excellent excuse to have an extra glass of wineService was excellent  Food was great  I had the foie gras appetizer and the salmon crepe for dinner  The foie was really tasty Its worth going back just for that   The salmon crepe was good  A friend at the table has the escargot it was excellently prepared The whole night was a lot of funFood was very good and the ambiance  and waitress  were authentically FrenchSaturday evening my Wife and I had the pleasure of eating at Paris 66 It had been a long week and we deserved something special I knew we had made the right choice when I called to make sure I could get reservations and Stephanie was pleasant and efficient and said she could fit us inUpon arriving everyone greeted us with smiles and Bon Jours We were led to a lovely table for 2My wife started with the Crevettes flambs a lanis The shrimp was dome perfectly and the touch of star anise complimented it well without being overwhelming I had the foie gras It was tender and flavorful but the fig bread and onion jam that accompanied it almost stole the showNext the waiter brought a palate cleanser which was zucchini foam that left us licking our lips and trying to figure out all of the flavors so that we might have some hope of duplicating this shot of deliciousness at homeFor entres the wife opted for the SteakFrites which was cooked exactly medium rare The barnaise was silky and brought out the natural flavors of the steakI had been recommended the Boeuf Bourguignon and while I was reluctant to have something as simple as pot roast when there were so many adventurous options to choose from it was the owner himself who recommended it I figured who would know better than himI am glad I listened It is amazing how a masterful chef can take and elevate something simple into something so memorable You could see the attention to detail in everything even the potatoes were sculpted identically so they would cook equally To accompany our entres we split and order of Cauliflower Gratin which was delicate addition to our meal A sort of whisper of flavors that you would pause to eat slowly to make sure you didnt miss anythingAs we sat there discussing everything we had just eaten we both realized how comfortable we felt We hadnt even noticed how warm and welcoming the space was We felt like we had been transported somewhere else and had been welcomed with open arms Watching the families dine around us it felt like we were regulars who had been visiting for yearsWe just wished we had left room for dessert Oh well I am sure there will be a next timeI have nothing but good things to say about Paris 66 The food was EXCEPTIONAL the service was impeccable and the ambiance was great I had the Roquefort mussles and they were absolutely to die for And the chocolate mousse was the best Ive ever had The menu was authentic and creative I felt like I was back in ParisI was so frustrated by our experience I wrote the management the next day  I did not hear back  It is with sadness that I write this email  My husband and I had reservations last night for 7:30 to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary  We arrived slightly early but were seated quickly outside  We then waited over 20 minutes before anyone approached our table  We were about to leave at this point  As we started to get up a server came to our table  We explained that it had been 20 minutes and she apologized so we continued  She gave us recommendations on wine which were both quite nice  We each ordered a glass  It took a very long time for the wine to come  At 50 minutes in to our night we had our wine and still no food  My husband left our table and went in search of bread because we were starving  At 1 hour and 30 minutes into our night we only had our appetizers  At this point I stood up to ask for our check  Our server said that she was bringing the food out right now and that in France they like to spread the food out over the night  I agreed that we like to eat that way as well but we spent 20 minutes after we were seated just sitting there and that has pushed everything back  I am not sure she understood  The entres came out  They were delicious  Although the beef beef bourguignon portion was very small maybe a cup but it was incredible  We pretty quickly got through dessert and coffee  Our server brought us some macaroons to take home  She was kind and very personable albeit  highly overwhelmed  The meal however was very very stressful  We only go out like this once a year  It was a sad way to spend our anniversary"

    "review":"They had a sign out front that said We Sell Slice Im down with your grammar dude The slice was pretty good and hearty but at 3 per they were kinda pricey The crust was heavier than a thin crust and more flaky and the sauce was okay The oil and texture suggested that the slice had been cooked twice and I think you would strongly benefit from ordering a fresh pie if you brought enough crew to make that an appropriate order Outside of the pie the bread twists with pepperoni were damn good probably better than the pizza The acoustical tiles in the ceiling have seen better days so its not exactly an anniversary dinner spot if you get my drift but a fine enough stop for slice on the way to the ballgameI just read a bunch of bad reviews but I also read a bunch of good ones Well that makes sense I guess because this sauce is a lot different than what most people are used to So I wanted to add a really good review because I love it  The sauce in this pizza is a lot sweeter than anything Ive had elsewhere but I absolutely love it and the few people who Ive introduced it to love it  I think its great And their other foodstuffs are really good too Ive had a couple hoagies from here and theyve always been really goodThis pizza is pretty great I usually dont need to wait long for my slice either ABest pizza ever We are well known by the staff and greeted and hugged We like our pizza plain and it is still delicious  we send all our friends and family down when they are in town Its a casual friendly clean place that we love and we will continue to satisfy our pizza needs hereCalled ahead and ordered a large Hawaiian pizza and it was more than enough for the family of four Probably the best Hawaiian pizza Ive hadMy boyfriend and I stopped in on a weekend night because we needed something quick before an event at the Warhol Its a pretty small shopabout three or four tables against the walland isnt the type of place you hang around after youre done eating The register is located near the back of the shop and the kitchen is at the front endWe just got three slices of plain pizza which cost 6 Id probably need two or three slices for a full meal They brought it out warm It was good but not really outstanding in any way Ill need to return when I have more time to try more items from their menu"

    "review":"Phenomenal sandwiches the sides are amazing too Very fresh  Great combination of flavorsI was wandering around the strip one day starving and wanting something different than the usual delicious food I get in the strip As I walked past thin mans sandwitch shop I remembered reading a pittsburgh magazine that praised the shop for using local organic ingredients and having amazing gourmet sandwiches so in I went I asked them what they recommended I try and they were all unanimous about the sandwitch I should order I dont remember what it was called but it had meat and pesto Thats all I can really remember because the sandwitch was so delicious it was gone in the blink of an eye I looked around to see what everyone else was eating and all of the food looked incredible Every single sandwitch being eaten could have been on a commercial for Thin Mans Sandwitch Shop I thought about ordering another one but remembered how close I was to peace love and little donuts Great little sandwitch shop that surely puts most others to shameThis place is better then you can imagine One of the best places to get food in Pittsburgh bar noneStopped at Thin Man today for the first timewill NOT be the last The sandwiches Thin Man and Smash were awesome and the chick pea salad was a nice healthy side big enough to share Also had the house made strawberry rhubarb seltzer water delicious and refreshing on a warm day in the burgh Do yourself a favor and try Thin Man next time youre in the Stripyou wont be disappointedThis place should come with a warning that says Just dont fall in love with me at least on the rotating menu of sandwiches Just as soon as you find a sandwich you cant live without it rotates off the menu Fortunately everything is good so you can fall in love all over again To have the best experience be a little adventurous and come in with the expectation that this is not your average sandwich shop The staff is friendly and the service is moderately quick for them whipping up these sandwiches from scratch Also the sweet ginger seltzer is their best beverage for my moneyThin man serves really good sandwiches made to order in their open kitchen as you wait and watch  I really enjoy their signature sandwich the thin man which has chicken liver mousse bacon and greens with a wine vinaigrette served on a toasted baguette  The chicken liver mouse combined with bacon was deliciously rich in flavor without being too heavy The prices were very reasonable sandwiches ranged from 79 dollars  They also had a nice selection of side dishesIf you are looking for fresh innovative lipsmackingly good affordable food this place is a must try  Of note as the sandwiches do take 1015 minutes to make from time to order so come preparedthey are well worth the wait"

    "review":"Food service and decor have been excellent every time I have been to Luma  I have been multiple times and tried menu items from every area of the menu and have yet to find any item that has been less than expected  Picky friends of ours also said it was one of the best meals they ever had very high praise from themLuma also offers excellent prix fixe menus wine deals and other deals on a regular basis  making their prices even more affordable  Highly recommendedAn old coworker recommended this restaurant for us and what a great decision it was I got the crab cake and it was to die for The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice but the waitress was just ok But even so I would still go back againReturned here with a friend for her birthday on a weekday  Parking was still nonexistent on a slow day We didnt have to wait for a seat and it was much less noisy this time though still quite dark even seated closer to the bar  Shared a bottle of moscato and a crabcake appetizer  The crabcakes are phenomenal but 13 for one cake with a bit of roasted red pepper aoli No I got the stacked chicken  It was cooked perfectly but the crispy coating was flavorless  The only thing lending flavor was the spinach and feta between the two chicken breasts and it was provided sparingly  The multigrain couscous was flavorless except for the sherry reduction sauceagain sparingly given My husband got the filetto be cooked medium well  It came out charred in places and was medium rare  There was red  I get peeved when a place that charges as much as they do being located in Castle Shannon cant cook a steak to specifications The dessert consisted of the date cake which was actually quite good  The cake was tender and not overpowering though I really wish there were more creative dessert options but thats a dessert lover talking  In my second review of this place I am actually disappointed for the above reasons  I may consider going back there but I first want to experience some of the other restaurants in the area that fellow Yelpers have sharedWent here with my husband and another couple  Parking was a real pain on a Saturday night  The lot was full and there was no street parking for quite a walking distance so be prepared to need a few to ten additional minutes for parking  We had reservations for 7 on a Saturday evening and ended up waiting 30 additional minutes past our reservation time while a seemingly flustered young woman whom I assumed was managing the incoming guests was busy with the group ahead of us for that entire duration  No one even asked us for our names upon entering or any time during our 30 minute wait I noticed the rest of the staff didnt offer to help her instead chatting to one another behind a semibusy bar thats located right near the entrance  In fact I think the oft color changing lighting of the bar lends to the restaurants name  The decor is sleek modern and attire appeared to be more smartbusiness casual  We were ushered to a very dark back corner on a platform with a view of the closedin back dining area that is used when the weather is better  It was quite loud in there and difficult to see our guests The bathroom was right next to us but there was a step that we didnt know about nor could we see between us and the bathroomand one of our guests almost fell  I had the poached pear salad as a starter and my husband had the French Onion soupboth were great initiations to the restaurant I had the moscato which was crisp with just the right amount of sweetness  For my entree I had the crabcakes and they were wonderful  Plenty of crabmeat in there with a great accompanying aoli red pepper I think and a side of vegetables that I recall were perfectly done  We didnt have room for dessert so we skipped out  It was quite a costly meal but I didnt find it to be grossly overpriced I  hear Wednesdays that wine is 12 off and Im hoping I didnt make that up  Overall the initial experience was offputtingand I struggled between a 3  4star review  I recognizes that even establishments have off days and the food and wine were definitely not disappointing Im plan to return for another dinner so I will add to my review accordinglyFirst time at the restaurant last night an was pretty disappointed Im not one to complain but when the waitress takes the fork out of your hand right after you tried a bite off your fiances leftovers thats extreme Stuffed salmon was ruined with a mound of super sweet jelly they called glaze Fried calamari was less than sub par They cooked an amazing fillet though For the price go to Mitchells or bonefish Wont be returningAmbiance  too noisy and loud crowd sitting next to uslike really loudof course this is not restaurants faultbut its a part of our experienceFood  The food was goodbut i wont say that it was out of the world For that price in Pittsburgh the food should be memorable It was 4 of us and everyone liked the foodService  the service was decent and quickI may not prefer to go again because of limited food options and nothing on the menu that i would not get anywhere and may be at a better pricebut most importantlythey did not have anything to surprise and keep me coming"

    "review":"I love a good hot dog and we were excited to try this place out after hearing great things We drove by one night with family and it turned out to be just a small inside counter with only about 2 seats They do have a picnic table outside for nice weather days We decided to come back a few weeks later and planned for take out this time  I ordered the regular hot dog and they have a wide variety of free toppings including ketchup mustard onions and pickles that I went for  My fianc ordered 2 of the specialty dogs one with mac and cheese with bacon the other with spicy peppers and sauce  We loved them all and the dogs are served on large fresh buns and they split the dog lenghtwise to get the toppings insideyum   For 250 extra you can get an order of fries and drink  I ordered 2 sides instead and got the mac and cheese which was amazing and I highly recommend I also got the potato salad which was not so greatbasically frozen hash browns in mayonnaise  Regardless it is still worth stopping by when in the areaMy girlfriend and I visited a few weeks ago and were certainly pleased Very friendly staff great location and a wide selection on the menu that appeals to all audiencesTry out the Pittsburgh dog with a side of fries You cant go wrong here Definitely recommendHole in the wall dive with some elite hot dog action Nice people and great food We came all the way from Dallas for thisChili dog done right Great dive in a good yinzer location of The Burgh Great staff Micah is one sexy mofo Most certainly a return visit when Im in the areaGreat dogs and welcome addition to the area I had The Porker and it was amazing Strips of bacon Not bits but stripsThese Irish boys do it right Every dog Ive had is spectacular I order something different each time Even their sides are great Plus theyre very welcoming too Right down from Slice on Broadway Check them out"

    "review":"Sometimes a single dish made poorly can negatively affect ones entire experience and thats what happened one evening several days agoIn Pittsburgh we used our Garmin to give us a nearby location for Asian food and selected Little Tokyo Bistro in the middle of a rain storm late one Monday night We ordered several items as is common in many Asian retaurants eg spring rolls tea various sushi rolls fried dishes etc and ramen And that was the issue a poorly made ramen possibly the simplest dish possible that both of us tasted and thought was unpleasant especially with the added cucumber slivers Everything else was okayThe service was good the price normal Reading the other reviews it appears the Bistro has more to offer but that was not our brief experienceDelicious Little Tokyo Bistro never disappoints  Exquisite flavors and fresh ingredients with friendly service one of my favorite restaurants in the Southside  Highly recommend the first date roll crispy and deliciousWhen in Pittsburghs South Side and craving sushi most people flock to the corner of 17th and Carson to Nakama  When I first moved into the neighborhood I followed suit  After squeezing myself into a chair at the sushi bar to avoid the painfully long wait I was served below average sushi during which I could hardly hear the person next to me talking  Personally I dont need valet parking button down shirts and high heels to enjoy my sushi  I was officially on the hunt for another sushi joint in my neighborhood Little Tokyo Bistro was next up on my list  Upon entering the sushi bar is immediately to the right and I was greeted with a smile and a Hello by the chefs  I then was promptly seated and already liked the more subdued lowkey atmosphere  The dcor is what you would typically expect from a sushi restaurant  The most important thing for me is cleanliness besides food and in my experience Little Tokyo meets this requirement  For starters we decided on miso soup and seaweed salad  The miso soup was a bit lacking in the substance department but the seaweed salad was very satisfying  During this Friday evening it was busy but not overcrowded and it took about 20 minutes for our rolls to arrive at our table  Like most sushi restaurants the rolls are served family style and are brought out on one plate  We asked the waitress to point out the names of each roll so we knew who ordered what perfect    On this evening I had decided on a yellow fin spicy tuna and an eel roll  All three were fresh and terrific tasting  More importantly the sushi stayed together as picked it up with my chop sticks and dipped it in my wasabi soy sauce mixture admittedly 34th wasabiI love the stuff  There is nothing more frustrating than sushi that falls apart as you pick it up  Upon our exit we were again greeted with a friendly smile and a Thank You by the chefsIf Im craving sushi and I want to stay in the South Side Little Tokyo Bistro is my goto place  Another plus is they are available for pickup  Ive had about a dozen meals here and all of them have been very solid  This isnt my favorite sushi in Pittsburgh Andys wins that award but it sure hits the spot as my neighborhood favoriteGreat sushi and very friendly staff even the sushi chef and owner asked how my meal was but the SiriusXM Love station was brutal to listen toMy new go to place for sushi sashimi in Pittsburgh  best value for price IMHO  I order take out and my sashimi is always very fresh nicely cut with good size portions and delicious  Never disappointed me and very pleased with the quality of my sushiI was hesitate about trying this place because I have known about it for years I am your typical Pittsburgh native foodie and believe in spending my money on quality food  This place is hands down by far the best sushi in the burgh and is reasonably priced Their warm sake with delicious as well  Will definitely being going back here again in the future"

    "review":"We celebrated my daughters 12th Birthday at Benihana on 101614  The food was delicious and the chef was very talented and entertaining  He did things with the food on the Hibachi we hadnt seen beforea big heart made out of fried rice and made it beat using the spatula       The only negative was when it came time for them to sing Happy Birthday our waitress was the only one around so our poor waitress was stuck doing the birthday songs by herselfSo we joined in to help her  No wonder our waitress seemed so unhappy with her job    I was happy that we had the option of brown rice and not just white or fried riceI thought the food was absolutely delicious and fresh Our hibachi chef Hoy was fantastic I ordered tofu and veggies asparagus broccoli onion snow peas for me everything was prepared to perfection We didnt get a show but we had really good conversation throughout our lunchOur server was in his words still waking up and not on top of his game at all he forgot to put in my boyfriends extra fried rice and something for the guests we were seated with When the server doesnt put in an order the kitchen doesnt put it on the cart and when your chef gets to the grill he doesnt have everything he needs and everything gets held up I left with a big happy belly which is not usually the case when I eat hibachi and everyone else in my party was just as pleasedFun fact: Benihana is no longer able to pop food in your mouth because someone in Florida I believe got a hot shrimp to the eye and sued the companyThis place has been mine and my familys favorite restaurant since it was the Samurai back in the 90s Over the past 20 years or so that weve been coming here I havent had a single bad experience Yes sometimes you meet some unique people at your table but I think thats part of the fun Whatever you do dont be that person who sits there with other people and never says hello Doesnt mean you have to be BFFs the whole meal but it makes it really uncomfortable if you dont at least try and be a little friendly The staff here who have worked here for years like Heidi are some of the nicest people around and if you are a good customer they definitely appreciate it The shrimp sauce here is far better than Ichiban Saga or Nakama They dont do noodles and rice but for me that is too many starches anyways They recently switched to the jumbo shrimp but if you want the regular size just ask They will also still do the Samurai Triple if you want it though it isnt on the menu Overall theyre very accommodating Its pricey but the quality is worth it Also sign up for the birthday club for a free meal on your birthdayWhere do I start  The horrible location  The hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating  Or do I skip right to the waiter  For those of you who have lack of taste enjoy employees at a restaurant that seem they could not care less about their job or even enjoy sushi not made the correct way  Even if you love establishments that hire employees that seem to not care for quality of food or knowledge of food  I HIGHLY suggest you go hereWhen we arrived at this location which opened up 15 minutes prior to us getting there we noticed a few individuals already sitting at their tables enjoying themselves so we figured wed be sat right away  Instead we were then informed by the hostess to please wait for a few minutes because they were getting our table ready  Ready for what  We werent even asked how many individuals would be dining nor if we wanted Hibachi or the sushi bar  After we found a seat by ourselves we awaited approximately for about 10 minutes for a waiter to give us our menus  After receiving our menus from our mute friendly waiter we were asked if we were ready to place our order  Our starters consisted of Spicy Seafood soup Edimame and Shrimp Tempura  After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to enjoy Sushi for lunch and so we placed our order to the waiter and asked if our starters were about ready in which he replied yes they should be out shortly  Instead 2 of our 4 Sushi orders come out followed by Edimame and then followed by the Shrimp Tempura 5 minutes after that  We then proceeded to ask about the soup and rest of our Sushi order we were informed the soup takes a very long time and that the Sushi was being made still  we understood why the Sushi may take a little more time due to what we ordered  The Edimame was very delicious but the Shrimp Tempura had me baffled at what we had ordered and why the cost was 8 for the very small portioned flavorless Tempura which included Im assuming a thousand island dressing for some reason  It was definitely not your normal Tempura sauce in which weve enjoyed many times before in other Benihana locations  As we get our 2nd batch of Sushi our soup was still NOT ready  Is this a lack of service food staff or poor kitchen management with untrained so called Chefs  We decided it was best to simply cancel the soup in which then we were coincidentally informed the soup was ready and if we still wanted it  During this whole ordeal we had not seen our original waiter since we had placed our orders and instead had 2 other employees that had no clue what we ordered and had to run back and forth asking what we had and what we were waiting for still  I wouldnt have minded being informed our original waiter was busy and they were going to take over for him had our order been alright or even if had our food been tasty  The Tempura was horrible the Sushi was questionable and the service was beyond ridiculous  If youre wondering what was so bad about the Sushi Ill make it simple for you  Looks and taste both scored a 3 out of 10  Lack of knowledge of the Sushi from the employees should of been a red flag to us from the get go instead we took a chance  We love Benihanas but never again at this location  From our experience with Hibachi type establishments weve always encountered great personalities great service and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience  Instead we left with a sour taste in our mouths and with about 60 less in our pocketsSeems my review was filtered so Ill share my 2 cents again this place is sad  Awful service awful food and the lack of knowledge is a smack in a real Chefs faceThe absolutely WORST hibachi experience Ive every had in my life It was my granddaughters 4th birthday and thought shed get a kick out of a hibachi chef Fist we wait 45 mins or so to be seated The restaurant wasnt even half full We chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions She lied Our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible He spoke so softly that you couldnt hear anything he said He barely spoke and didnt put on any kind of show at all Our 4 year old was so bored that she wanted to leave The other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food The chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else The only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions None of us even like onions My steak was at least 14 fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didnt even leave enough for a small sandwich By the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold We asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them However like I said the chicken was all mixed together and at least 14 of my steak was complete fat and thrown out The manager didnt seem to care at all about our situation We paid almost 10 a meal extra for the dinner portion He could have easily knocked it down to the lunch price but he refused After all this we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit  I for one will never EVER go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away We feel completely cheated"

    "review":"Tonic tries too hard  I have never been impressed with any meal that Ive eaten there and it always leaves me wanting more  Unfortunately its right next to my office so it often gets picked as the lunch spot  Ive gotten the burger a couple times  It comes on foccachia bread with fancy greens and never with ketschup or mustard  I always have to ask for it and by the time it comes from the kitchen the burger is cold  The salads never have enough dressing either  I dont consider myself a picky person when it comes to dining but I do have a tolerance and a threshold concerning the quality of food and service  Tonic has crossed that threshold too many times  I have friends who love the place but Ill go out of my way to avoid itThe apple bacon and maple aioli burger is ahhmazing Their wraps also delicious They serve the best french fries  the ones with the little crunchies on them We choose here for lunch sometimes during the work day Reliable seating availability upstairs Great building and location especially during furry week Perfect furry spotting locale Occasionally the service is a bit too slow And my friends order no pickles but they always leave mine off as well BooWas here again about a month ago As mentioned in my first review I was super intrigued by the kitchen sink burger so I got it togo one night I got it with sweet potato fries It was delish So goodCame back another night with a friend and got the chicken caesar salad 15 Huge and SO good But  dessert was the true winner of the night Our waitress Amanda according to my receipt was super nice and recommended what I think was a special It was a smores parfait see picture Layers of deliciousness marshmallow chocolate mousse graham cracker crumbs  more that I never wanted to end And at 5 it was a bargain Will return solely for the dessertI went here with a friend last night  and our entire visit was horrible Upon arriving we stood by the door for a good five minutes waiting to be seated before figuring maybe we were just missing something and sat down at an empty table With no wait staff in sight apart from the bartender we waited for about another 1015 minutes before deciding to try out luck at the bar Once again another 10 minutes passed by before the bartender asked us if we had been waiting when if Im not mistaken she had not only seen us walk in but also witnessed our seat change  So we ordered drinks and they were decent nothing special in my opinion However my friend did complain that hers was a little too strong but she can be very picky with those sorts of things In regards to the food it seemed they were pretty much out of anything anyone would really want For example when I tried to order the beer cheese dip the bartender told me they were out and recommended the buffalo chicken dip which I subsequently ordered It turned out to be extremely spicy which caused me to down my drink about twice as fast I wasnt too big of a fan My friend ended up ordering some sort of barbecue burger and was told that they were out of hamburger buns so it would be on wheat bread She said it was an okay burger but she wished the bread hadnt been so soggy Overall this night was a complete waste of money and while I cant speak for the service and quality of food during lunch time I can certainly say I will not be returning to Tonic Bar  Grill anytime soon and I would advise you to do the sameThis bar has a very modern and nice interior While here we had a Citrus Mojito The drink was large fresh and tastyThey have a limited draft selection for beers but have a large bottle selection for the beer drinkerVisiting the Pittsburgh area for the weekend Packers will be in town playing Steelers so figured I would enjoy the city Went to another bar for drinks and was feeling a bit hungry so stopped inThe kitchen was closing in 2 mins so luckily the bartender lets us order a few select items Figured we would order the wings since that seemed pretty quick The wings were ok at best Felt like the wings were just warmed up and smothered in BBQ sauce My friend bf enjoyed his wings but mine were a little pink on the inside and didnt seem cooked to me The service was fine and the bartender was attentive Overall not sure if the food was just rushed but would be willing to try again"

    "review":"I think gourmet may be stretching it a bit but Mandarin Gourmet does manage to rise above the mediocre haze of fast food Chinese places in the downtown area  If I could Id probably give it 35 starsWith large lunch specials and an inviting space for patrons who prefer to stay and eat the MG balances their somewhat greasy and oversauced standard chicken pork and beef dishes with hospitality fast service and never providing a truly bad mealAs a regular who eats there once a week or so the management and staff recognize me  such personal attention at a downtown restaurant  Whats more if you tire of their runofthemill General Tsos or Sesame Chicken try their soup noodle dishes for a refreshing changeLunch specials come with soup or an egg roll and your choice of rice  I always get steamed rice simply because the amount of sauce included with the dish will usually permeate the rice anyway  If you eat there the rice will come in a separate bowl as opposed to the onepiece tupperware you receive if you choose to grab takeout insteadTheir portions as I mentioned are large the MG is one place that wont leave you wondering how soon youll get to eat dinnerThis afternoon I had a chance to catch a meal at an old regular lunch spot  My fortune today:  Balance life with a little sweet  sour  A very fitting fortune and advice I am taking in writing this review   The sour:I have all but given up on Asian Cuisine in Pittsburgh  Compared to other major cities throughout the US we Pittsburgh are strongly lacking  That said this is one of the better options for ChineseMandarin food in the area  My rating of 4 stars is based on the fact there are no really great options available  In any other major city this place is a 23 star restaurant at bestThe sweet:While I have had other menu items today I opted for the General Tsos White Meat with brown rice and a Shrimp Egg Roll  First off I like that they have the option to go with white meat for the dish  The sauce is just a tad too sweet for me but I think it will be suited for others who do not care for spicy heat  I like the option to get brown rice but I recall it was free before and now there is an up charge  I still say go for the brown rice as the Mandarin Inn is tops in getting the consistency right There are multiple options for an egg roll or spring roll with chicken or shrimp in the egg roll options  The best part of the meal and what keeps me coming back is the spicy mustard  This stuff will bring tears to your eyes in large amounts and will also really clear the sinuses if needed  I recommend this for anyone not fearing some strong horseradish flavorAll in all I had a good meal and will continue to return to this establishment when I am downtown and my craving for some Asian cuisine starts to peak againThey wouldnt deliver to me bc I ordered only one item She said I no drive to you for 13 dollars I said Please Ill tip She said Ill be there in 25 minutes I havent got my food yet bc I just got off the phonehopefully they dont read this before I get it I ordered the genreral tso chicken but said easy on the sauce Ill let yall know how it is on another post if I dont get into a food comaEvery now and then I get a hankering for Chinese food for lunch and order takeout from here I used to have to call but now you can order and pay through their website  However after having order via the website today with pick up time selected as ASAP I will call in the futureI ordered pork with garlic sauce white rice and egg drop soup  Normally when I order takeout via telephone it is ready by the time I get there to pick it up just a few minute walk from my office  Today however I arrived to pick it up And waited  After the cashier asked my nameorder I saw him furiously scribble something down on an order pad then walk back to check on my order I dont think they checked their web order and my order had been sitting there without going back to the kitchen25 minutes after the timestamp on my order confirmation email the food was ready  Thats an enternity for Chinese takeoutThe food is good fresh and a nice portion size But I ordered take out because I didnt want to wait and sit down somewhereDont get me wrong the food here is fantastic and if you eat in or pick up you cannot go wrongThe delivery is usually decent but if there is an issue with your card you have to wait longer than they promise to get your food  They dont process cards online so they have to do it in the restaurant  Its a little frustrating esepcially when they promise a specific timeGreat for a quick lunch downtown  Service used to be slow but as of late service has been extremely fast  We were seated ordered our food and served in less than 15 minutes  The quality is good for the price  Certainly not cheap but not pricey either  I think it was about 9 for wonton soup and general tsos chicken  Food was hot fast and portions were large  Not a place to treat a client but a great coworker lunch spot"

    "review":"We went here for my Mothers birthday and the experience was overwhelminglyBAD From the time I picked up the phone till the time we left we dealt with a company that could care less about what garbage it puts out in the worldI will start with the confusing reservation we had a semilarge party 10 and it took about seven phone calls I just counted from my call log to actually get a reservation After finally speaking to some party planner woman who when I finally got to speak with her went off on an antigovernment tangent like the ramblings of a nutcase any sane person would be ashamed I actually had to ask the woman a second time to repeat her story so as to make sense of her crazy antigovernment taxation narrative After a second run with the story I THINK that she was blaming the government because we needed to pay a 3 charge on the room we reserved and the tip could not be included because of the government  It was literally the ramblings of craziness I personally try to keep my politics out of making reservations After that I almost cancelled but being I live in New York I really did not have the knowledge to keep looking around for another place to have the birthday We finally confirmed this reservation but not without two messages being left on my phone by other staff members that sufficiently lacked phone skills It sounded like a message left by an angry high schooler that was trying to bully me The only person that I spoke to with any restaurant or phone skills was a man named Jay We got to the place and the one hostess made the only gesture of kindness from this entire experience she took the cake that we had brought so that we were not standing there with it in front of the place When we got to the room it was called the captains quarters and it smelled like a dirty mop I asked the waitress to get us some candles to mask the smell but of course she could not find any Our waitress was horrible one of our party guests never got a refill on his drink nor were others asked if they wanted more cocktails She left appetizer plates on our table for way too long even when our main dishes came up YUP still have those appetizer plates sitting in front of me If you can get your waitress to help you at all you might order some very AVERAGE food If youre into midgrade nothingspecial cocktails and food then here you go this is your place I was so upset as the night came to an end that I almost thought about leaving a below 15 tip cause you know the government is going to take it all any way so why even leave itright But my good conscious said no you could leave 18 and that was more than kindI came here with my family for a meal The food was very good overall as was the service And while the prices might be in line with the market prices they seemed very high to me I ordered the trip with a small piece of salmon 6 shrimp and a crab cake It came with a vegetable side The salmon was great and well prepared The crab cake was ok The shrimp however were a little rubbery and dry For 30 dollars I probably wouldnt get that again I would however try something else here My family members got steak and all of them were cooked perfectly They were all very satisfied with their desserts as well which were shareableExcellent meal We had a family dinner for 13 on Easter Sunday and the staff and food couldnt have been better  We had Cara as our waitress and she was just naturally pleasant professional and really skilled with people from our 86 yr old dad to our 4 yr old  The seats were comfortable and there was plenty of room for us to eat Let me start by saying they have the best clam chowder Ive EVER tasted Our dishes ranged from perfectly cooked NY strips to bourbon salmon to the trio and everyone raved about their dinners We also got appetizers everyone loved the civiche and the spicy crispy shrimp  And desserts the shark fin pie was delicious  The only slight negative was the bread Its sourdough and people in this area might not be used to how sour it is That being said it was fresh hot and crusty I didnt care for it but thats a personal taste issue Theres plenty of food without the bread Id come back here in a heartbeat for another family dinner Everything was fantastic and perfectly executed :Food is just not good Bread was sour with butter all over Chicken parmesan not edible Tuna was so so The best thing was mashed potatoes but there was hair in it Very overrated and overpriced Have not been here for the last 3 years will not come for the next 3Awful Experience from a Landry Location Our server Ashely looked like she had taken one to many Xanax She could barley stand up straight The food took forever to come Not cooked to my liking also But when my 7 and 9 year old kids ask Daddy Is the waitress sick its a fucking disgrace  So pathetic Shes a druggie and the restaurant was awfulWow  What happened to this place  It used to be a great place to go to to enjoy a really good fresh fish meal  Not any more  I have 2 reviews  1 My Dad and I recently went for lunch on a Thursday  There were maybe 10 groups in the whole restaurant  We were seated in the back of the restaurant  It was stinky  hot  No air circulation at all  We told our waitress they did try to solve that problem by turning down the air conditioning    It was almost comfortable by the time we left  I had to call our waitress over from another part of the restaurant to place our order after a 15 minute wait after that   As for our food really just mediocre at best  I always order iced tea for lunch it tasted old  The cobb salad was really just chopped fish in a mayonaise mess served over lettuce I ddnt expect mayonaise  My fathers gumbo was good he was satisfied  Waitress was nice just unattentive   Also kitchen and restaurant were very noisey  Dishes breaking things dropping right next to us at least twice no appoligies for noise  2This past Sunday my husband wanted to go to sit at the bar and grab a quick meal which is something we often did on a weekend night with no hesitation  I strongly tried to persuade him to go elsewhere after my last experience with my Dad   We love when Terrie is working there she gives great service and is great to talk to   She was not there this Sunday  Our bartender was really unattentive and seemed bored to be there  Never talks to you short quick answers  The restaurant was not very crowded we got a seat at the bar right away it was early also before six  It started to fill up as we were sitting there  Maybe six more people came while we were there  Bar was still more than half empty  It took a long time to get our drinks 15 minutes and a long time to get our order in 20 more minutes and a long time to get our food 2530 minutes   The bartender spent a lot of time talking to other employees with her back to us  My husbands shrimp tasted fishy salad tasted old  My salmon was just ok nothing special not bad though  All in all It used to be a great place to go to for a nice meal  Now its too pricey for just mediocre food and mediocre service  We will definitely go elsewhere  Mitchells has gotten old and tired"

    "review":"My FAVORITE place to get breakfast ever  So good everything is amazing  I love the coffee too  Great service and awesome place to get breakfastAlthough we had recommendations from a friend to go to another place for brunch we decided to try Pamelas when we saw that they had four stars on Yelp and there was a HUGE line on the street waiting to get in First things first if you are thinking about going here: They are cash only Theres a PNC bank with an ATM machine right around the corner on Penn Ave if you like us dont normally carry cash Then even if theres a huge line go inside right away and put your name in the waiting list We waited a good ten minutes in line before realizing that the line was meaningless  you really need to have your name in the list and then go outside and wait The line goes pretty fast though so dont get intimidated by the size of itOur son had a feta and spinach omelet and loved it another AWESOME I had a veggie and feta omelet and my husband the ham and cheese Our omelets were OK  nothing to rave about it like our son was doing about his spinach and feta And the omelets were kind of tiny especially when compared with the amount of potatoes that are served in the plate I did wish the omelet was the star and kind of the plate not the potatoes and toast Looks like their strength is in the carb world after all My son and I also tried the hotcakes  my first time having it and they were worth every single second of stomach pain the gluten gave me after eating a few bites The outskirts of the cakes were really crunchy like a waffle cone and the inside is a thin light pancake Really good I just couldnt eat a lot not only because of the gluten but also because of the guilt  they are NOT a diet food VERY buttery but what else would you expect of them right As I told my husband they taste like the ultimate winter breakfast comfort food I can only imagine a really cold morning freshly brewed coffee and hotcakes Yum And talking about coffee theirs was really good Not too strong and not bitter at all just the way I like it The waitress eventually left a carafe of decaf for me at the table which I really appreciated because their mugs are kind of tiny Final thing to be aware: When we were done eating we waited forever for the check to come our waitress could have been a bit less absent When we finally asked the waitress for the check she told us with a this is the most natural thing in the world  face that the check had been delivered with our food a long time ago How come we didnt think of that right We really didnt see the check among the 300 other things in the table So if you are not from the area and dont know how things work over there bring cash put your name in the list and keep an eye out for the check which comes WITH your foodThree stars because I didnt think that the breakfast was that awesome Probably would think otherwise if I knew their system ate gluten and wasnt aware of carbs1 place to take out of towners  I mean Obama chose these pancakes once which is good enough for me I remember when after living in Pittsburgh for six months an employee of mine looked at me like I didnt speak english cause I had never been here Now that I have been here like 25 times I wonder how I havent reviewed this place before I have to be honest everything is average except for the pancakes which are are like 27 starsI really wanted to like this place but was disappointed  Pros:probably one of the better diners in Pittsburgh but not of national qualitygreat industrial diner atmosphere  Busy and feels localcheap plates are 7Room of improvementstaff friendliness seems hit or miss on busy daysfew authentic ingredients ie fake butter fake maple syrupover use of salt corned beef hashover medium eggs came out over easyno apparent effort to support local farms or sustainable food systemIt could be great and hopefully will be soonThis place does not take cards fyi I was very excited to try this place so on my last day in town I dragged my 8 college students there haha It was extremely busy on the Sunday in June that I visited and it took a few minutes to find a table but honestly I had expected a much longer wait Definitely a diner and looks like a local favorite Our server was very friendly and we received our orders fairly quickly especially given the size of the group My group ordered a variety of different breakfasts but I went with the croissant french toast on the recommendation of the server It was great and definitely something a little different Now I wish I could go back for the pancakesThe breakfast potatoes were quite possibly the best Ive ever had  The omelets were good but look for the specials they were hidden on the tabletop card  The list system is great  Put your name on the list and then explore the strip"

    "review":"Food was very good dont get me wrong Just felt that the selection was a little limited Pretty much if you werent getting soup or a salad then there was somewhere else in market square you probably would prefer more Not a bad place just having trouble competing I guess Although cant say I blame them for just sticking to their strengths rather than putting a bunch of stuff on the menu they cant do as wellI went here for lunch this week an had a BLT mushroom soup and a fancy designer root beer I went at 1:oo and I was the only one there The BLT was good  Tomatoes were ripe and yummy The soup was also good with a strong earthy flavorService was fast and friendly and knowledgeable about the foodI thought it was over pricedWhile it was nothing to write home about it was good enough to give it another try laterIve been wanting to try Mattiniero big time since its opening a few months ago and today I got my chance So Mattiniero looks very cool its sleek design is appealing  plus lots of natural light makes you feel cozy The sandwiches wraps and light fare on display look delicious and I mean DELICIOUS But oh what an illusionAfter partying whole hartily for the 4th of July yesterday I needed some serious grub The chicken Parmesan sandwich was the daily special and it looked perfect It came with soup as an option and the asparagus leek sounded perfec as well I also ordered a side of the fresh potato chips  seemingly fresh from the fryer and a bottle of pomegranate sodaLong story short everything was incredibly disappointing The sandwich was surprisingly small cold served on a tasteless doughy bun and very much tasteless itself except for a strange unpleasant yet unidentifiable taste All the way creepy The soup was so salty that I coughed on the first spoonful I tried It was foul The potato chips were a little under cooked and really just tasted like old cooking grease I had such high hopes for Mattiniero too The damage came to nearly 13The bottle of pomegranate soda was excellent howeverBesides the fact that they gave me the wrong sandwich Im still a fan  I ordered the parma cotta sandwich which is ham sorta like prosciutto from what they told me with chili relish but what I got was a tomato mozzarella basil sandwich  So I know I paid more for what I actually ordered than for the sandwich that I got but let me tell you something  it was freakin tastyI think it was the bread  it was AMAZING  It was crispy and flaky on the outside and soft on the inside  it just made everything in the sandwich that much better  Im a huge fan of basil  heck you could put some basil on some dirty socks and Id probably try to eat it  All in all it just workedI got a side of the chips  which I highly recommend bc they looked freshly made  They were crispy and salty  just the way I like them  I wouldnt say they are overly salty  occasionally I got a salt covered chip but Id brush off the extra salt on to their less salted friends and lets just say we all got along fineThe place is to go and serves breakfast and lunch according to their sign  Its small inside so Im thinking youll have a line out the door during the lunch rush  Go at an off time and enjoy one of the better sandwiches in the areaI never thought Id give a 5 star review to a take out place but boy is it worth itFirst awesomeness  priceAt Starbucks Id probably drop 10 easy on a yogurt parfait and latte but a parfait and cappuccino were about 6Second awesomeness  real espressoNot only is the size perfect 68 oz cup is what a real Italian cappuccino is usually sized but the espresso tasted wonderful and the milk so creamy I rarely can find a good cappuccino that reminds me of the cafe next to the Colosseum in Rome Third awesomeness  real fruitYou know how at Starbucks the yogurt parfait is like dessert and probably not super healthy due to all the syrup on the berries Well not at Marriniero because the raspberries and blackberries are fresh as can be and taste ohsodelightful with the yogurt and chopped up granolaFourth awesomeness  ambienceAmbience At a take out place I know its hard to believe but yes For some reason it just feels right Mattiniero is clean with high ceilings simple yet pleasing decor and helpful staff Walking in here started my day off perfectlyFifth awesomeness  locationRight next to my bus stop and market squareGod I love this place"

    "review":"Food is always excellent as is the service  A great go to spot as you know its always excellentOTB Bicycle Caf was the driving force behind a trip to Pittsburgh After watching Rick Bayless on Top Chef I was eager to taste his brand of Mexican food and was not disappointed My friend and I each had a tasting menu and shared each others selections The plates were beautiful and delicious There was heat in most all the dishes but nothing was overly spicy or hot We opted for the margaritas over the wine selections but felt at another time the wine pairing would be a good choice as well It was such a magical night of flavors I had never had mole sauce like that before it reminded me of the movie Babettes Feast where there the diners are transformed through food and wine Service was attentive and informative Well worth itGreat place Must stop if you are a cyclist Food is good bar food with cyclist themed names I always stop when in Pitt for a minuteWent there with family while visiting back home Atmosphere was excellent Food was great Our waiter Ray was the best very accommodating and attentive to our needs We will be backI eat at OTB frequently for lunch since I work nearby its in my rotation and its most likely not changing  The burgers are good and I enjoy that I can get a beef or turkey burger as in Pittsburgh thats a rarity  For lunch my biggest complaint is usually the time it takes to eat there and its a little overpriced  It doesnt look like there is a lunch menu so 9 for a lunch burger is a little steep  If you want a side salad instead of fries they do have good fries its 2 more which is also a little expensive since there isnt anything special about the side salad  Their soda also tastes a little grimy and flat usually could probably clean the heads more often The beer selection looks great but I dont partake really during lunchThis place is ridiculously delicious   I was looking for a decent priced place to meet up with friends for dinner  It has a bicycle theme inside and its very quirky  They have a few beers on draft and they were thankfully craft  I had the pierogies for an appetizer and the a turkey burger with Mozzarella sauted spinach and roasted peppers with a siracha sauce  All of the food was deelish"

    "review":"Hands down one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh They have a vast beer selection decent prices and good food especially for bar food Their wings are some of the best in the city and you cant beat their Wednesday night wing specials Its not a fancy place by any means but the drinks are cold people are friendly and there are plenty of TVs to watch the gamesOk so I come here ordinarily as they have an excellent cider selection Today I came in and they had just that However that is where the bad experience started There are 4 bartenders on I am typing this as I sit at the bar  The 2 guy bartenders are pleasant and out going 1 of the female bartenders acts like she only sees regulars   I order a cider and hand her my  credit card and say to open a tab as I am ordering food  She takes my card and leaves my cider doesnt leave a menu Doesnt even look my direction for 15 mins It was another bartender who asked if I needed something  Then I ordered the cheese dip Normally comes in a delicious bread bowl  Instead it arrived in a Styrofoam container with not enough bread for the dip I also ordered 6 wings w ranch The wings came out way ahead of the dip odd right  The ranch never arrived at all The other 3 bartenders made up for the  one bartenders lack of interest in new customers Sadly this is the 3rd time this has happened wthis bartender Think I may have to try another establishmentwhich is sad as they have great drive o and food selection:It is a dive bar so do not go their expecting anything else There are many many different specials throughout the week and have a regular happy hour from 4:306:30 which is half off appetizers and a dollar off drafts The wings are amazing and pretty cheap They have at least 30 sauces and dry rubs to choose from and one day I will try them all The wings are perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside I also got the provolone sticks and they were pretty good as well Not only is the food and drinks good but this place is incredibly affordable and the service is goodA few things are really great at Sidelines  For one the food  Great burgers and wings  Second the beer selection  They have a number of beers on tap including some local brews as well as bottles  They also have a mug club for those who choose to be adventurous  The food prices arent bad but some of the beers tend to be pricey  The service too can be hit or miss  I wouldnt call it bad service but some of the bartenders arent very attentive  However its not frequent enough to keep me awayTheres a great neighborhood bar atmosphere here if youre looking for a good place to hang with some friends  Excellent place to catch a Pirates Penguins or Steelers gameSidelines is definitely the goto spot for wings in the city I took my wing loving husband here because he just moved here for the first time I grew up here He was very very very happy with his ranch buffalo and hot garlic wings The service is rather slow and the place is very simple but its worth the trip over if you are in dire need of some good wings which are often hard to find in Pittsburgh Give it a shot but be prepared to wait even when it isnt busy We waited about 45 minutes for wings but would still come backGreat wings maybe the best in Pittsburgh PA Theyre crispy and the sauces are good"

    "review":"Cafe Du Jour is a delightful unpretentious little deli restaurant seemingly set away from the craziness of East Carson Street I went to lunch here with a few friends on a weekday and it was totally empty The menu is simple mostly soups and sandwiches but the herbroasted pesto chicken sandwich I had was absolutely delicious and only 650 My friend gets the baked brie apples and raspberry honey every time she comes here and she graciously let me have some  it was quite tasty I cant wait for the snow to melt because the outdoor enclosed patio in the back looks sublimeGreat food and amazing atmosphere A little pricey not somewhere to go every week but definitely worth it a few times a year Love it And beautiful summer back courtyardAs you walk into Cafe Du Jour you feel like youre entering someones kitchen Its a warm and kind of homey feeling Since it was summertime we were seated outdoors The atmosphere was relaxed but still good for a casual romantic date A large extended family were seated behind us and some graduate students with their advisor to our right My date and I started off with the Spinach  Asiago Dip which was not only superb but generously sized The baguette itself was delicious As for entrees my date ended up getting the chicken and I got the salmon My salmon entree was satisfying with its layers of flavors All in all service was good We left full and appreciative of the quaint little spot tucked away on Carson StreetFirst rate foodPresentations were especially well doneMy swordfish was very fresh with light tomato sauce accompanyingI only wish there were more restaurants like this one in my home town of HoustonBring a bottle of wine and enjoy Cafe du JourWe had a wonderful dinner here last night The food was some of the best Ive had in Pittsburgh The seasonings sauces presentation portions everything was great But my favorite was their back patio where we ate surrounded by gardens and beauty It was a great atmosphere for us to catch up with and impress our inlawsDreaming of a delicious fresh dinner on a romantic candlelit outdoor patio  This is the place for you  I needed peace after a rough day at work and found this on Yelp Thanks to others for providing the photo of the patio  I adored the spinach appetizer  The chef provided delicious gratuitous roasted carrots with goat cheese that were wonderful  The salmon dish was very good  The accompanying salad had a special oak flavor that was wonderful  I like oak in my wines now Ill look for it in my salads  BYOB and cash and you have yourself a special evening"

    "review":"The service was horrendous We were told there was a wait inside and we could sit outside in the hotel lobby but still be served It took 10 minutes and us flagging down someone before we were able to order drinks and tell them we wanted to brunch buffet We were given the breakfast menu where the menu says the buffet is 20 including coffee and juice Unfortunately we were charged much more for the Sunday brunch buffet and extra for coffee We were being served by the bartender who was also making drinks at the bar and clearly overwhelmed We had to ask the hostess for silverware and napkins after we had been to the buffet She said yes what do you need I said we need all of it since we were given nothing and had to seat ourselves outside Because the bartender was so busy it took about ten minutes to get anything including coffee and orange juice  Almost everything that we got from the buffet was sub par and the best thing I had was the muffins which I could have purchased at the Starbucks in the lobby  The eggs were cold the biscuit was hard turkey was mushy and cold and the gravy was dried out Not a satisfactory meal at all and extremely upsetting to know we were paying so much for food that was not good at all  I felt bad for the bartender who was really trying but overall this experience was very disappointing since we were staying in the Omni and thought Sunday brunch would be fun here You live and you learn though  We dont live in Pittsburgh so we probably wouldnt go back anyway but I would definitely pick a different brunchbreakfast place in the futureI just love the decor of the dining room with its high coffered ceilings white table cloths sparkly glassware and wait staff who are dressed appropriately  Our office has been here twice for luncheons  Each time the waiters take time to explain the menu of the day and are very attentive for the picky ones sitting at our table  A little pricy for every day lunches but a very nice treat for special occasions  This is my first choice for office gatheringsThe Omni does things right From atmosphere to food quality everything really comes together The staff is all very knowledgeable and they love their locals They treat me just like I am a new guest which is pleasant It can be a little expensive but its worth every penny Def a special occasion kind of placePlease be careful of flies in your food or drinks : totally creepy expwith the basic hygiene totally disappointed Holy smokes What a great experience We came to reminisce about coming here as kids the first fancy restaurant and special occasion place from the 80s Its beautiful It was pretty empty so we figured the quality had gone way down NOT SO Our waiter was personable knowledgeable and attentive He was super accommodating even with my restrictive diet My table mates each had an appetizer each excellent When our mains came I had a problem and started to ask the waiter what I could do He called the chef who was Exceptionally responsive got a thorough understanding of my condition and needs and rocked the best meal Ive had in months I live in LA and just got back from a trip to Vegas where I dined at 5 star places I have a high bar I came I enjoyed I even learned Shame it is so empty on a Friday night this place and this chef especially deserve some attention Mark my words this guy will go farLet me start by saying: everything I ate here was really really good However I had time to digest each course before the arrival of the next one It was not a busy day We were not a rude or rowdy bunch There was at least one staff member visibly lounging around and watching us at all times We did not order custom creations In fact everyone in my party but one ordered from the prefixe brunch menu The other person ordered fruit bacon and potatoes Again the food  delicious The service  confusingly befuddlingly bewilderingly slow   For those who appreciate quantitative data: we were seated at 11:20 and left the restaurant at 2:30  not by choice"

    "review":"The only nice things about this place is the outdoor seating on the water its convenient for hikersbikers and its dog friendly The food however is EXTREMELY overpriced for the quality and quantity Probably wont be back Such a shame a place like this in the Burgh could have great potentialThis was my first visit to Redfin Blues and I was underwhelmed  While our server was quite nice she wasnt very attentive long waits for everything were the norm  drinks water finally placing our order getting the appetizer and eventually getting our entrees  We ordered the Chips  Dips to start which included a large plate of tortilla chips and two immensely small servings of dips you had your choice of dips we had the artichoke dip and the pineapple salsa  The dips were tasty but there was only enough for about 13 of the chips  That was grossly overpriced at 10 which would have been reasonable if there was more dipI ordered the fish tacos  There were three small tacos loaded with lettuce and topped with very small strips of fish no side dish all for 16  It was worth about 6  I wont speak for my friends except to say that no one raved about their foodThe river view from the deck was nice but the smokers were notWhile I would give Redfin Blues one more try in the event that this was an off night I doubt it will be any time soonAfter waiting FOREVER for our waitress  to come over  she finally showed up at exactly  6 to tell us  its 6 oclock so you cant order beer at the happy hour price The view is great service not so muchThe setting is very nice and its relaxed and chill  Go for that and dont have great expectations about the food and it will be a little better than you think  The island its on is a beautiful place for a walk after you have had your fill  go upriver to the end and there is a historic park with signs about Washington  If you are patriotic you will love it because its where he dug deep and became a great leader  He literally swam across the river right by this restaurant in January pulling someone who could not swim after being shot in the face by an IndianJust returned from RFBlues where I usually enjoy myself quite a lotThe bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer No bigdeal pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken assuming shescolorblind I waitedAnd had a 2nd drinkAnother group of 3 people came in after that ordered their meals andgot served their entreesI went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be comingShe announced that salmon takes longer to cook than what a rawsalad I cook salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cookand that I was about to check on that It had been over an hour bynowI got my sandwich promptly after complainingA few minutes later when I finished my salmon I got my side ofvegetables apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon tocookAll sarcasm aside: one screw up is tolerable The second  forgettingto even check on my late order until I complained an hour after Iordered is not And yet I wasnt given the least consideration inthe billA little pricy for food but not too bad Sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day When they put the boats in the water its a little noisy but entertaining I had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland Iced tea was good This is not the place to come to have a good meal but a nice view and a breeze then its ok Next time I think I will just get drinks and an appetizer and enjoy the viewOther people I see complained about the service but our waitress was really good and took care of us without hovering"

    "review":"The food is amazing The atmosphere is ok not a ton of seating and pretty crowded and well hipster But if you can get past that the food is AMAZING and reasonably priced As were the drinks Well be backAmazing food Everything is fresh tasted delicious The place is cute feels like youre in California somewhere Cocktails are very very good too 5 out of 5 starOn a cross country road trip and ended up here for the pierogis Delicious Good drinks and cool vibes tooMy husband and I chose Apteka as our last date night as a nonmarried couple and were both blown away The food was PHENOMENAL No tasteless vegan mush here The pierogi salads stuffed cabbage and crostini were all stellar The staff was accommodating fast and fun Love the minimalist decor and look forward to the outdoor patio they are working on Their wine selection is minimal but amazing the Italian red I got was velvety and delicious and their homemade wildflower soda was bananas good And after all was said and done enough food to fill us both to the brim and a few drinks only set us back 40 plus tip What Will definitely be back and cant wait to spread the word on this amazing local joint Bravo AptekaApetka is a great little space with charming decor However when I say small it truly is To the point that a line goes out the door for folks waiting to get in I understand the European concept of ordering at the bar and having the food brought to the table But again theres just not room Ok with that small little negative comes the big big positive I am over the moon with this menu Love that they offer small and big plates as well as fantastic cocktails And the black pepper soda you guys OMG I need that bottled for home: its so good Went with friends and had tartine and pierogis Im a meat eater but can throw down on some good vegan The food is absolutely divine The vodka black currant and rum plum wine juniper cocktails are so refreshing and appealing Just a quick walk from home Ill definitely be a regular This is one of those spots wed walk by anxiously awaiting their opening Wow it was worth the waitNot a vegan but appreciate being vegan lite from time to time In any event my friends wife really wanted to try this and he asked if I wanted to meet up here We had a table of 4 and noticed that upon arriving you order right away We each ordered an item and a beverage and sat down towards to the back where they are building some outdoor seating My drink was the Vodka black currant vermouth burnt lemon which turned out to be very good I had some food before I met up so I decided to try their Salatka z koperkiem which is a salad in case you were wondering salad with sorrel red mustard greens shallot apple radish escabeche and lots of dill My friend got the Pierogi and he said it was amazing Other drinks of the night included trying a glass of their Birch water which none of us had ever tried It had a sweet taste but different than coconut water Almost nutty flavored It was also semi sweet We all agreed that it was strangely good My friend and I at that point decided to infuse it with vodka and other flavors at some point down the road All in all we had a good first experience and will be back again at some point TlDr: Vegan cafe that boasts good creative food with inspiring cocktails They should have the runners pick up orders from existing customers so you dont have to go back and wait in line if you want another plate or cocktail"

    "review":"I wasnt too impressed with the steak salad the steak was good  a little over cooked but good  The salad was just too plain You have a choice between a few different salad bases I ordered the House salad the last time I was there I ordered it with my meal and loved it soo I thought this time with steak it would have been amazing Maybe the Chef was slacking tonight I dunno I dont know what they spent on the steak for the salad but i do not understand how they came up with the price of 17 I didnt get a 17 dollar salad tonight for sureExcellent dinner tonight with super service from Rachel My dinner partner had the mussels I had the clams and sausage and we split the creme brule for dessert PerfectionWhen in town do as the Romans do rome around  Love eating here and its only five miles away from home Penn Hills  Attended many events here and also eat here on a regular basis  Always like stopping in and getting a Roman Burger and Fries  Stopped down a few week back to see all the old Studebakers  My Dad had a 51 and a 60  Friendly and helpful servers  Keep up the good workBrunch here today Great food for an affordable price Everyone so nice Our server was awesomeWent with two friends All the wait staff was friendly and helpful I had the lasagna and I have to say that it was the absolute best I have ever had  My other friends had gnocchi and they loved it as well Great portions too  Without a doubt I would highly recommend Roman BistroI really wish this place were more consistent The food is either incredibly good or incredibly bad There is no in between We have been coming to this place since it opened because we live in the neighborhood and have sampled pretty much the entire menu with several repeat favorites  The pastas are what are most inconsistent From the texture of the pasta over or under cooked to the sauces either the wrong sauce or what seems to be cold sauce from a jar its either spot on or a train wreck  The sandwiches are the same story The menu says they are built one way but I have yet to have one served to me the way the menu declares it  Example being the prime rib sandwich  the meat can be full of flavor or bland Its supposed to have horseradish aioli on it Mine had no trace of any aioli and I showed my server They brought me a cup of it but then proceeded to charge me for it  Unacceptable to be charged extra for an item that was left off of a sandwich that was advertised to have it included  The service is the same as the food Wonderful or awkward Some of the staff are very nice and professional Others are grossly inappropriate  I once had a server in an effort to be friendly compliment my diamond earrings and presumptuously turn to my male companion and ask why he couldnt buy me a nice diamond ring to go with it  bc my companion was my brother for that meal not my boyfriend  Id say just go there for drinks but even that is hit or miss If you happen to get Billy you are in good hands If you get Dutch just turn around and leave Youll never get served or offered a refill bc hes too busy juggling bottles or texting someone  And I have never had a good female bartender there Another shining example of awkward service  a newer bartender and I have not seen her since over heard my boyfriend and I talking about his job She asked if he also worked in the restaurant industry and he said yes he worked back of the house She looked at him and said Back of the house guys are all aholes and walked to the other end of the bar It was obnoxious and unprofessional I guess Ive had my fill of bad experiences there Last nights meal was the straw that broke the camels back which prompted this review Both inconsistentbad food and horrible service   Sorry Mr Roman Ive met you and youre a nice man but I hope you can fix your staff soon"

    "review":"A huge disappointment Way over priced with the smallest portions Ambiance and the drink list are OK However can not make up for the price Yelp reviews are over shootingPhenomenal  One of the best meals Ive had in a long time  Very expensive but worth every penny  There are only about 12 tables in this place so make reservations  It was packed on a Tuesday nightWe FINALLY made it to Cure week before we leave Pittsburgh and thank God we did Best restaurant I have ever eaten at hands down If MP is my affordable can go fairly often for really good food restaurant then Cure convinced me it could be my favorite date night place ever If we werent movingThe food is beyond delicious Our meals were so perfect  amazing  etc etc David ordered the Meats platter and I got the Beef Goat  Pig Heart Bolognese When they came out my first thought was Gee you dont get a whole lot for the price Not that I need nor want a ton of food but this looked tiny However after the first bite of my bolognese I didnt care The meats were so rich and tasty and delightful and the pasta was cooked perfectly I couldnt stop saying Omg at first My bfs meat platter came with squab breast duck confit pork belly chickpea frites muhamarra baba ganoush harissa zaatar feta and orange There wasnt a bite on there that wasnt amazingly delicious I dont have enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe this food When I first moved here I convinced David and his family that curing brining and smoking were absolutely the way to go with most meats if you have the time and equipment Cure just further proves that point Cure takes a really great dish and elevates it to damn near perfectionI guess I should talk about the cocktails too I think this is the first review where that part of the review didnt come first though we sat at the bar for like an hour before we ordered food Our drinks were very tasty indeed and the bartender  Colin  was nice and friendly But seriously  dat foodThis is opposite of MP or Eleven in that at least at the bar it doesnt really encourage hanging out and just sipping cocktails Once the another couple came to the bar area theres only 4 seats it was rather cramped Once we were done eating it was like   Ok lets go But thats ok I dont need to dwell in every restaurant 5 stars for CureLardo blood sausage duck speck Dont ask questions just eat it all Cure will earn your complete trust after one sitting and in future visits youll gladly and willingly put yourself in the capable hands of the kitchen Why Because everything they create will make you wish youd found them sooner One of the true gems in Pittsburghs growing restaurant sceneExcellent as always  I would have preferred to sit at a table but I called too late and we sat at the bar  The bartender was very helpful and gave us a couple of tastes of his favorite vodkas and gin  The salumi plate was top notchmy favorite being the chorizolike paste  We also had the lightly fried pig skins which were a great accompaniment for the salumi  For dinner I had the sea bass  Although it was very tasy with a cauliflower sauce it was heavier than I anticipated  My bad because most fo the dishes here tend to be on the heavier side  PS  The oysters on the half shell were about as fresh as I have ever hadWe had reservations for 8:30 on Saturday night but were not seated until 9:30  We had to wait an entire hour at Allegheny Wine Mixer great place  The food was good but not enough to wait an hour for seating with a reservation"

    "review":"Good pizza and i love the breadsticksi dont know too much else about this placePizza is very hit or miss When the owners are there its really good When they arent you get pizza that is over cooked more like burnt and LONG delivery times The pizza even when plain is very greasy Way more than other places around Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese Also they do not take credit or debit cards There are better optionsIncredible The Pizza is the best in the area by far The Sandwiches are great as well but in my opinion the best food they have is their Calzones which I highly recommend This place deserves a 5Star as far as their food is concerned but the dinein potion of the shop is tiny and makes diningin quite unenjoyable so Im forced to give them 4stars Would highly recommend either picking up or having something delivered not so much on eating there thoughOkay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg PA of all places Where I am at really there is no delivery but these guys did They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg Downtown run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi That pizza iswas MILES better than this This crust while thin did not have flavor and was hard The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like The cheese was good The sauce was meh Ive definitely had way better 2 stars for being cheap and deliveringWhat you havent been to Bellisarios yet This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for and boy howdy is it good The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice The dough itself is flavorful not too well doughy The sauce is great and they dont drown the pizza in it Theres just enough cheese not so much its an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you cant tell its there If you can go while Mamas working all the betterYou can eat in here they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls Two of us split a small 8cut pizza with one topping 9 and with our two cans of pop we were out for 10 You cant beat that And Id put Bellisarios pizza up against any in the cityI grew up a five minute walk away My mom loved Bellisarios and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home my mom being too dollarconscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly ablebodied children around to go pick it up Every time I have a slice it brings back great memories But Ive had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it isIts a little divey stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza but its perfect If youre in West Mifflin say going to Kennywood drive over and eat a pizza Theyve also got hoagies and calzones and I think thats about it But with pizza this good who cares"

    "review":"We had a party of 9 so the gratuity was automatic otherwise the server may have gotten 10 or less She tried the standard upsell on wine then was upset when I ordered a less expensive bottle since we were ordering a couple Then she talked us into the meat and cheeses family style app Later we found out that she added another 2 20 apps that she had told us about as she walked away from the table She took her time the rest of the night all with an attitude Then when the check came and was split it was a debacle Every card was tripled charged until later rectified The manager did take the additional apps off the check and apologize for the waitress Its a shame the food was really good but service is what brings me backLets just say if you have tickets to a show you better allow yourself a good 25 hours to eat and enjoy your meal because reservations at 6:15pm to be sure we made an 8 pm show was not enough time  The night started out great  We arrive  4 in our party at 6:15pm and were immediately seated at a nice table in the back  Bonus The atmosphere was very nice  Bonus Our waiter Chris was nice enough and I do not blame him for what happened  He took our order after a respectable 5 or 10 minutes  We informed him of our 8pm show time and he assured us that we will have plenty of time  We ordered the turtle soup some kind of risotto balls salads and our main dishes  Around 7:15pm we asked what the status was on our appetizers as we had not yet received any  Shortly after our soups salads risotto balls all came out at the same time  The turtle bisque was pretty good as was the caesar salad  I thought it unusual that everything would come out together but whatever  7:35pm we were waiting for our entrees and reminded Chris about our 8pm show  7:40pm our entrees arrived  We asked for the check immediately and scarfed down our entrees  Which were just ok  The Bird asked to see the Manager about the delay and stated that if 6:15pm was not enough time for us to have dinner there and catch an 8pm show they should have just told us when we made the reservations  He only said that they do not make excuses and that the bottle of wine was on the house A nice gesture I give them that  No one in our party had time to finish their entrees and were all bloated from wolfing it down  Plus we never did receive our check  The manager eventually brought it over and of course it was not divided as we requested when our orders were taken so hence more delay  Funny thing is I did read theses reviews the majority being negative  and my buddy was even advised not to try Vallozzis by a friend who happens to own a restaurant in the south hills but I had to try it myself  I think we all learned the hard way tonight  As far as the food goes like I said nothing special and in fact I am still feeling a little ill some 4 hours later  Vallozzis please if you need over 2 hours to prepare a meal that is quite alright but dont tell your customers differently  We ran into another couple at the show who were also late due to their dining at Vallozzis   Such a nice place but we will never go there again  SorryI had invited colleagues of mine to dine at Vallozzis The food was just ok and probably on the expensive side regarding its taste The service was extremely slow What actually makes me write this review is neither of the previous facts What happened is that my wife forgot her hat at the table when we left After a couple of days we called them and after calling back and forth they told us that they found the hat When we went to the restaurant to pick the hat the manager said that the hat was not there I asked him what happened and why they told us to come and pick it up His response was that the hat was there a couple of days before and they had kept it for us but all of a sudden they lost it The most annoying thing was that nobody apologized for this inconvenience but they were also rude They just said we can not do anything about it we cannot find your hat now This is the first time that such a thing happens in a restaurant Unfortunately I do not recommend this placeI have never been to Vallozzis and had my first experience on Saturday Needless to say I will not be back The atmosphere seemed promising: a warm romantic feel with a lively crowd Bar service was good with a decent selection to choose from Dining area seems crammed On multiple occasions we watched servers collide in the limited spaceFood was mediocre at best with the exception of dessert Mozzarella bar appetizer was interesting and was a hit with our 6 person table but I was extremely disappointed in my meal I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Lobster Risotto which sounded delicious I was looking forward to a rich creamy dish on a cold night When I received my meal I was disappointed to see that my risotto was more rice pilaf with almost nonexistent moisture There were also diced red peppers mixed in which due to possibly misreading the menu I was unaware came with the dish and which I can not eat So I spent half my meal picking around them  Fried lobster was tasty but the lobster that was mixed into the risotto was rubbery and overcooked All in all so not worth the 32 Dessert was FANTASTIC The table shared a seasonal cannolli pistachio and an order of the bread pudding Both were deliciousOur server however was HORRENDOUS He was inattentive borderline rude at times and we seemed like an inconvenience to him He would disappear for 1530 minutes at a time and would look in a different direction if anyone from our table flagged him down We ordered a bottle of wine for the table which he them plopped on the table No drink that he served us was set nicely down All were dropped from at least a 2 inch height and was left unopened until we flagged him down 20 minutes later to which his comment was Oh I thought you had a cork screw When we placed our meal orders I asked for a 2nd drink from the bar and did not receive said drink until our dessert was served Another guest at my table was not served her dessert beverage until the check came And then there was the check When the check came it was one single check for 6 people even after we asked at the beginning of the meal to have the check split into two separate ones When we questioned this his rude response was Well I cant do it now because I CANT remember what everyone had So he was asked to put 23s of the bill on one card and the remainder on another card He screwed this up too Charging both cards the incorrect amount then disappearing before we could complainAll in all it was one of the WORST dining experiences I have ever had Not worth the price of the food to dine there and be treated that way Serving staff need to be retrained on customer service especially on busy weekend evenings I will not be returning to VallozzisStay away made reservations but seating was changed when we arrived A party of 6 and all had poor meals Sent a letter to management and never heard backIt isnt that the food wasnt tasty or the service wasnt good I just expected moreWe went for dinner early on a Wednesday evening  When we went to the hostess we were given attitude that we didnt have a reservation  It almost felt like the look she gave us was to shame us for thinking we could get into their establishment without a reservation  They did have available seating in the lounge area so we took a seat and were promptly greeted with a meal drink and pizza menu  I was underwhelmed with the options  I felt like they were trying too hard to be trendy and Top Chef like in their entree choices  The menu lacked basic Italian staples like spaghetti parm or simple pasta dishes I ordered the cabonara and it was tasty and the portion large but it was not a true version of the dish  My husband had the lasagna and rather than it being typical lasagna stuffed with either meat or cheese it had a variety of fillings including butternut squash  Everyone enjoyed the flavor of their entrees but did feel that they were overpriced  I like the concept that aside from the dinner menu there is also a fresh mozzarella bar and a charcuterie but overall I think the experience is not worth the prices you pay"

    "review":"Braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel  Very nicely decorated with good service but the food is a bit overpriced for what you pay  We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since its conveniently located inside the hotelThe breakfast buffet here is 15person and does not quite worth its value  Its basically 15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items eggs bacon  Lunchdinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown expect the typical American grill  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless youre looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurantI went with a group of friends and we were all impressed with the decor The hotel is beautiful and its right by the baseball stadium which is really cool The drinks menu was awesome and the drink I had was greatI liked the butcher paper on the tables and the waiter was really nice He was great about answering my questions and even helped me decide between two dishes that sounded good I ultimately went with the lobster gnocchi and the full serving was actually a huge plate of food The gnocchi was nice not the lightest gnocchi I have ever had but pretty good and the lobster was cooked well The sauce was quite rich and decadent and after a few bites it was feeling like it needed some acid or lightness I think a small side salad with a tangy vinaigrette would have been nice to add to the dish I did take a gobox home so I ended up getting 15 meals out of this actuallyOne of the other diners had the pork and beans and it looked and smelled amazing I would go for that the next time I goA tip about parking: if you ask the waiter they will validate your valet parking if you eat at the restaurant I really appreciated that because its a difficult area to park in especially if there is a game going onBack in Pittsburgh I arrived at the hotel late after working I grabbed a table in Braddocks for a late meal and to watch Monday Night FootballI had mussels  frites with a Braddocks smash cocktail The food and drink were excellent Braddocks has a great menuHad the arugula salad short rib pirogues and kielbasa board Salad was great Pirogues were awesome Kielbasa was outstandingI highly recommend the aboveI had dinner with my son and his friend there last night One word incredible My beet and goat cheese salad was a meal in itself but the scallops and polenta left me wanting to lick the plate My son had the bisque and pasta special and his friend the gnocchi and lobster Nothing was left Cant wait to returnThis is the restaurant and bar located in the lobby of the Renaissance in Pittsburgh  I stopped by for a few cocktails after a deposition  I had a friendly competent bartender and a nice manhattan  I would definitely like to return to try the food"

    "review":"Mr Hoagie is an institution Walking in it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago old fashioned menu board booths out of the 70s and a large selection of food Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie and it is voted the best in the area year after year I usually order the burger while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen all of the other ingredients are very fresh Overall its a good alternative to Subway which is down the roadExcellent food Superb customer service I miss the mario machines they used to have but its still a great place steeped in traditionPROS: Italian hoagie was delicious  Friendly counter employee The restaurant was clean and neat CONS: The pizza was not good  Preformed crust NOT fresh dough  The price of the failure of a pizza WAS NOT CHEAP EITHER  I guess the name says it all  Get the hoagie pass on the pizzaNormally I do not do reviews of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad  If I had not felt sucker punched and mugged after I left Mr Hoagie I would not be writing this bad review  On my first and last trip there I paid 2459 for two whole hoagies  1 The Italian ordered because the woman she working there told me it was their most popular hoagie I ordered with lettuce and onions no tomato italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie  I had to pay 1 to add cheese to the hoagie  Because I was traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away I asked for the italian on the side  She told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side  I passed on that on principle  Are you kidding me  I just saved her money by declining the tomato  I was not going to pay for the dressing on the side  At this point I am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble  That pales in comparison to what happened next  I opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slices of meat on this hoagie  Ham salami and bologna  Bologna    Who in the hell puts disgusting bologna on an Italian hoagie  That disqualifies that hoagie as an Italian  The red flags indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view  One area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna no ham and no salami2  The Steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce tomato onions and dressing  I ordered it without lettuce tomato onions or dressing  I asked for mayo on the side  I had to pay for that so I declined  Are you kidding me  I just saved them money by passing on the lettuce tomato fresh onions and dressing  I paid 3 to add sauted mushrooms onions and cheese  Here we go again  Canned mushrooms that were not even cooked through were still cold and onions that were still crunchyundercooked  News flash:  you need to serve fresh mushrooms that have been sauted canned mushrooms are another sign this place is in financial trouble  I literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because I could not taste or see it  The hoagie was 50 mushrooms 30onions 10 cheese and 10 steakI could have personally made 10 whole hoagies with substantial quality ingredients and toppings for the 2459 I paid for these two whole hoagies  I intentionally patronize nonchain restaurants to support small businesses  In this case Never Again  The hoagie bun was better than average  Wake up or you are going to lose your businessI like this place a lot Its a good toasted hoagieI actually dont like a my bun exploding with meat but as a previous poster mentioned if you do maybe you wouldnt like this placeThe inside badly needs updated though The staff is friendlyFirst the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because theres no competition Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost 2574So Im thinking with the reader choice awards and 10 per 12 hoagie these will be awesome I was sadly mistaken The only reason I didnt give one star is because is the bread  dressing is fairly decent So on to the hoagies the Italian is general run of the mill Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce You get more meat at subway Nothing really special  NOT worthy of the 10 price tag Second the steak hoagie it is atrocious No cheese You have to add cheese for 1 so now the steak hoagie is 11 That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce  onion hoagie I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie possibly the worst value of a hoagie Ive ever eaten Im not say eating at subway is any better but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so Check out pasquales down the road better hoagie  price"

    "review":"The environment is a lot nicer than it was previouslyno complaints other than the fruit flies around the open ketchup dispensertht was kinda nastyThis McDonalds has a very nice updated decor I like how the furniture and the tables appear to come from IKEA  They now have Bar style seating with large red cushions that are smooth and made of some kind of leather like material The wall tiles are very large giving the dining area a feeling of openness My favorite thing about this McDonalds is that the menu is on large LCD TV screens as opposed to a chart The picture quality is really clear and bright and the options are easy to read as opposed to before when they were dimly lit The parking lot is a lot more open too giving you a chance to maneuver around cars that are backing out or waiting in the drive through line This McDonalds is definitely an upgrade from the one that was there before its no longer on a sharp hill but everything around the restaurant is generally flat so that makes for a nice smooth trip going through the drivethroughI was hungry and I needed to pee  What can I say  The bathroom doors are locked and the associates have to buzz you in  You would think they would be clean  not so much  I was able to get myself a twocheeseburger meal to sate my hunger  Oofit was another bathroom run soon after"

    "review":"This is likely the most eclectic and artistic location Ive ever been for brunch  Studio AM is part restaurant part contemporary art gallery with refurbished tables and art on the walls ranging from cool elephant paintings to old school Chuck Taylor kicks  I dig the atmosphereI dont think they normally do a Saturday brunch right now since theyre just getting started but we had called ahead for a reservation of seven and they had prepared a buffet just for us  Now you could order from a limited brunch menu and pay 10 to forgo the buffet but then you would have missed out The buffet was delish with Ratatouille cheesy potatoes fried rice and bacon  You could then ask the chef to prepare eggs for you to go with the other items  Additionally they brought out crazy good chocolate banana pancakes that were like crepes and some excellent french toast  All this for about 10  They also had coffee tea and flavored water includedGreat staff great atmosphere and fantastic foodHave been meaning to check this place out for a while finally went for my husbands birthday today 25 seemed a little steep for brunch but we were not disappointed Really cool vibedcor great friendly service excellent food Somewhere fun and different to go in the area I would highly recommend checking it outBest brunch in the burgh This place has it going on Service was excellent everyone is super friendly and the food was relish This is our new brunch spot for sure The atmosphere is so cool and the staff make you feel at home Hubby and I went with our two little guys for Fathers Day brunch and really enjoyed ourselves Very kid friendly Kids loved the pancakes and French toast The hubs and I wanted to lick the bowl of the sausage gravy and the grits Go nowA very cool space to have brunch  There is nothing else like it in Pittsburgh Truly one of a kind experience  The atmosphere is beautiful as all of the walls are covered with Baron Batchs Pittsburgh Steelers art  There are huge murals and paintings for sale both on the walls and in the art cave downstairs   Literally everything that could be painted has been painted even the tables piano and bathtub  It is very eclectic and you cant stop looking at the art everywhere  There is art work for sale from stickers tshirts and pocket art to larger paintings both framed and unframed  Something for any level art collector who wants something very Pittsburgh The food at the brunch was absolutely delicious  There is a buffet that includes sausage bacon cheesy potatoes chicken vegetables and delicious cut up fruit salad  But you had better save room because Chef Steve Morehouse brings out three more full courses First course includes the most delicious banana  chocolate pancakes super thin and French toast with an amazing strawberry and vanilla sauce that is to die for  Second course was the cutest mini biscuits and gravy and third course varies but today it was crab fried rice  It is crazy that all of this food was only 25  The art on the walls changes every few weeks and sells out quickly so get it while you can I love coming back all the time and bringing guests to see the beautiful artI went here for brunch with my brunch club and had high expectations from this new spot The food could use some improvement and the pricing structure was very confusing and ended up being quite expensive for what I got and could eat I hope once they get some brunch weekends going they improve on the food The highlights were the cheesy potatoes on the buffet and the awesome atmosphereDiscovered this gem at the recommendation of a coworker Brunch begins with a buffet and spans 3 full courses The food is served in a space full of original artwork with an Art Cave on the lower level The food is phenomenal and the staff is friendly If you enjoy quality food people and vibesvisit Studio AMBrunch is served only on Sundays from 11am  3pm They also open their doors for Thai Thursdays from 7pm  11pm"

    "review":"definitely an old school deli has  that feel all their sandwiches even a decent Philly cheese steak and im from the Philly area  with names of sandwiches like the frat guy the professor the freshman etc this plays well into the college town vibe good prices with a beer distributor next door grab a few cold ones and get food and you got a good meal prices are really good too everything is less than 8 bucks roughly and you can walk in with a ten spot and get a good quantity of food they dont short your on that hereUsually these guys have good food but NEVER ordering again THEY DO NOT CLEAN FRYING OILGREASE Do not order any fried food from this place I got mozorella sticks here the other day and they smelled so bad Sadly I actually ate one and the after taste was in my mouth for days Grossest experience Ive ever had I used to be a regular but will forever warn people of this establishment Truly dissappointedStaff was rude and disrespectful The food tasted like it was cooked from a frozen conglomeration of mystery meat But I simply cant get over the inexperience on the grill Its almost like they sacrificed talent for convince Their manager Joel  is really nice but the rest of the staff couldnt give a crap less about the businessI absolutely love everything that the Campus Deli has to offer Its super convenient and quick They deliver and you can even order online I recommend the Philly Cheesesteak which is amazing and my go to item on the menu Also the menu is super fun and completely college orientedI live down the street from this place and wish for nothing more than for it to be better  I was excited to hear the items on the menu  I am a sucker for a sandwich with lots of abstract foods on them  I have tried The Student and The Professor on multiple occasions  Every time I just wish they had a different sauce on them and more of it  The sandwiches are dry and lacking in flavor  If you ask them to put more sauce on which I did after the first time they charge you extra  I dig the creativity but it is lacking in everything else  The wait is also ridiculous  It takes almost 20 mins each time Ive been there for them to make the sandwich even if theres no one else there  Not to mention the people who work there are rudeDefinitely the best sandwich shoplunch stop in Oakland Very delicious and reasonably priced The buffalo chicken wrap is amazing Perfect amount of spice and flavor Highly recommend Campus Deli"

    "review":"Came here today for Sunday brunch There was no wait I was seated immediately with my dad Service was very good however for brunch the menu isnt all that expansive They have a starter and entree special for 18 I got the beignets as a starter and the crab cake benedict The beignets were divine I wish there was more than 2 The crab cake benedict was good I usually love Cajun food and seasonings but I feel they over do it a lot We got the marghertia pizza as an appetizer and it was just okay Im not a fan of green tomatoes and they sort of put a lot of Cajun seasoning on it But my dad enjoyed it He got the catfish po boy it was huge But he said it was very good Overall a good experience I definitely want to go back and try something differentDelicious food and a great atmosphere I had the jambalaya and it was great I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for creolestyle food done rightWe stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon Ordered a Shrimp PoBoy with Cajun fries and Jumbalaya  both were very good and flavorful Portions were perfect sizes for lunch we didnt feel overly full afterwards The waitress was nice and attentive and even had a suggestion of dipping my fries in the hot sauce as an alternative to ketchup I would most likely go back again if I had a craving for some NOLA foodNola never disappoints Ive been three times in the past 6 months and its always just so yummy The service is wonderful and its affordable  I dont so much like the decor It feels dated somehow but thats just personal taste Try the red beans and rice To die forExcellent Authentic New Orleans food as good as Ive had outside of New Orleans The place looks feels and tastes like New Orleans Definitely worth a visit when in Pittsburgh Also a great location right on Market SquareBeignets almost as good as Cafe Du Monde PoBoys were on perfectly baked French Bread The oysters and shrimp were perfectly seasoned and friedOutdoor seating seating available A taste of New Orleans in Pittsburgh of all placesAtmosphere is nice Food is okay though not real New Orleans style presentation I had the jumba yaya soup which lacked a little of the Cajun punch I didnt care much for the lack of bread on the side  The entree was the blackened salmon with pecan rice and shrimp etufee The salmon was tasty the etufee was bland The dish was good but not four stars Seems like a popular place although I have found that after six years of travel to Pittsburgh you dont come here for the food"

    "review":"Super impressed This place is a total 180 from 5 years ago The bar atmosphere is great huge TVs from all angles with good food to boot Super glad to have a new hangout in townUpdate Three things that came came to mind while eating here1 I wish the bar served drinks in glassware as apposed to plastic cups2 Theyd sell a lot more drinks if they had a server work the room as I was feeling to lazy to walk to the bar for a second drink3 They need deserts on there menuThe new restaurant at cool springs is a much needed addition The inside is clean modern and bright Graniterock counters large windows gorgeous patio seating outside and a large bar The menu is what you would expect it to be burgers pizzas apps salads We tried out a salad and 4 meat pizza The salad was great with dark greens no iceberg here The pizza was also very good with the exception of the crust which was obviously not homemade The only downfall in my opinion is that you order at the counter and seat yourself The line at the counter can be long and the tables fill up fast on busy daysExcellent place to watch the game Wish I would have come here earlier in the year to take advantage of the outdoor patio Damn oncoming winter I digress Good food nice beer selection A real live Happy Hour Cant ask for much more CheersWe decided to try the Fairway Grille on this freezing cold day because we were starving and we were curious to see the changes made to Cool Springs before Spring actually got here I ordered the Steel Curtain burger It has 12lb of beef 2 slices of American Cheese lettuce and the house sauce think Big Mac sauceonly better   It came with fresh cut fries and a pickle The burger leaned more toward well done than the medium that I ordered but it was very tasty I ended up eating only half because between the burger and fries it was a lot of food My hubby ordered the Garlic Parm wings They were hot and crispy with tons of fresh garlic They were served with a homemade Ranch Dressing and celery Im not a huge fan of Ranch dressing but the Ranch dressing here was excellent My youngest son ordered a hot dog and fries His hot dog came with grill marks YumMy oldest son ordered the fish hoagie It was THE biggest fish sandwich I have ever seen It was served with tarter sauce I believe it is house made also The fishy was crunchy on the outside and light and flaky on the inside It also came with fries We were the first ones in the restaurant today but little by little people started coming in Most of them had been in before We will definitely be back There are still wraps salads and pizza to try  The service is outstandingThe worst service everThis was the first time I ever walked out Waited 15 minutes for a waiter finally went to the front counter and asked for help A waiter come overwe ordered 2 beers After 20 minutes no beers and waiter never even looked our way Still had menus on our tableWe walked outnever to returnHorriable service Food was good except sons grilled cheese which had one slice of unmelted kraft singles on huge italian bread  I had to ask 3 times for a highchair and was finally brought a booster seat then had to ask again Waiter never checked to see if food was ok or if we needed anything I had to get ketchup from another table"

    "review":"Moved to the Strip and tried the food with a group of four  The Shepards Pie was awfulI am not sure what the meat was and the flavor was odd  One other person tried it and would not eat it  The fish n chips were not good  The fries were soggy and soft fish mediocre  VERY DISAPPOINTED  AND IT WAS NOT CHEAP  Will not go eat there againWeve heard both good and bad about this place  My wife loves corned beef and cabagge so we had to try it The atmosphere was great as was the entertainment  The food was a bit of a disappointment  Her corned beef was dry I had a Shepards pie The chef had such a heavy hand with the salt that I couldnt taste anything else This is probably a great place to listen to music and grab a beer The food Not so muchI love authentic Irish pubs like this one Probably the best tasting Guinness Ive ever had The food selection is a little limited but everything Ive experienced there has been very tasty My friend and I went there and he had the wings according to him they were probably the best wings he has ever had The atmosphere is very warm and friendly and often with live musicWanted to like this place as we havent explored the strip district because of the touristy feel and crowdswanted to explore different areas of the city The fish was kind of slimey and didnt have a good taste The fries were really hard and had been cooked until they was no potato within them The Shephard pie had instant mashed potato taste some crumbled hamburger and plain cheddar cheese on top with small shreds of carrot Not much better than a KFC bowl and the onion rings were just the frozen food variety Not sure why people like it so much If we had been drinking we wouldnt care Maybe they had a bad day I would recommend paying attention to cook times and to get rid of the fish Maybe use fresh or in store made ingredients for Shephards pieWe made the foolish mistake of trying to spend our Groupon at Penn Brewery on a Saturday without a reservation  Daunted by the wait and bellies hungry for delicious comfort food my boyfriend I were sullenly driving back toward home when we remembered  isnt there a little Irish bar just off the main drag of the Strip District  Lets go investigateSo investigate we did Id say around 730 on a Saturday night  It was oddly quiet and uncrowded inside  a few tables here and there but no big groups gathered around to watch a game over drinks or eat dinner  There was lots of Irish paraphernalia on the walls but the harsh lighting and widely spaced tables made the bar feel a bit uninviting  A little dimness couldve gone a long way  We got some beer on draft  a Harp for me  and started with the fried pickles which were served with honey mustard  They werefried pickles  They were served as whole spears not bitesize pieces so sometimes the breading would slide off but they were hot and tasty with the tangy mustard  Good size appetizer portionBoth craving something authentic my boyfriend got the fish n chips and I got the corned beef and cabbage  Both were utterly no frills  My boyfriend lauded their authenticity and I have to confess the fish n chips were spot on  Especially the fish  That taste  It took me back to my semester studying abroad in England eating fish n chips out of a paper cone  It didnt need anything fancy or unique to dress it up  it was great as it was  He was hugely satisfiedI was underwhelmed with my corned beef and cabbage  While I wont question the authenticity the overall effect was that the food was plain  Wellcooked and in a good portion but not really craveworthy  There were some vegetables on the side as well everything prepared with utter simplicity  I enjoyed the taste but after a few bites I wanted something more  It was a large portion so I took some home but we werent even motivated to reheat it  It didnt really do it for me   Apologies to Ireland if thats how this dish was meant to be prepared  if thats the case I suppose it just wasnt my thingWe started to leave just as a few musicians came in  I think Id enjoy coming back here for a drink and an appetizer during some live Irish music  Service was a bit slow but if I was there to relax and unwind for a few hours I wouldnt mind at allI have numerous bad experiences with Mullaneys Harp and Fiddle now  It is one block from where I work so I only go for the convenience  I usually get the steak salad which used to be good  The last 4 times getting it I have had issues  One time it will be a nice full meal and other times it looks like a kids salad and for 13 that isnt worth it  Last time I went for take out my bill was 13 and some change  I gave the bartender 15 and only received 1 back  She decided to keep the rest of my change and acted like it was owed to her  I didnt say anything but was bothered that she would assume that she could have my change  Today even though I said that I wouldnt go again I was craving a salad and have little time for lunch  I asked for medium cooked steak and it is BEYOND well done  It is actually crispy  The French fries on top are rock hard but are not burnt which seems to me to be recooked from yesterday  I cannot eat this  I will certainly walk the extra few blocks from now on to get food that is prepared properly   Never again for me"

    "review":"What happened  This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh and Ive been to them all  My favorite item was the tortilla soup and I used to drive my husband crazy because Id get incredible cravings for it and would just HAVE to go Cuzamil at least once a week  The last few times Ive been here though its just gotten worse and worse with my last visit the worst of all  I ordered my tortilla soup as usual and while it looked as delicious as always it was completely watered down and flavorless  So disappointing  I ordered one of the combination meals with a taco quesadilla and chili relleno  I am happy that the chili relleno is now an actual half green pepper with meat and cheese inside it used to just be a sliver of a pepper buried under a pile of meat and cheese so this is an improvement from the past  But everything else was just bad  My husband and friend complained that their meat was overly salty and burnt  The chips were stale the salsa bland and the pop was flat  My husband said there was something wrong with his Dos Equis  And every time for the past year whenever I request the fried ice cream dessert I am informed that they are out of the fried ice cream I dont usually complain about waitstaff  They are usually just overworked kids getting paid poorly to deal with stupid people  I dont really blame them for being unhappy or not very good at their jobs  But the one waiter here wow  I want to ask him if hes being held captive there or something because he looks and acts just so damn miserable like you are ruining his life by being there and he is disgusted by your existence  I have never seen a smile gotten a thank you a hint of small talk or anything remotely in the neighborhood of good service from him  This place used to be so great and I really dont know what happened  Considering that we were the only customers in the entire place I guess other people have realized its gone downhill toogreat food reviews on wwwbigtsreviewscomwwwbigtsreviewscomMy boyfriend and I come here all the time and the service is always friendly  One of my favorite things to get is the enchiladas con mole  I always get one chicken one bean and one cheese  All are great and the sauce is delicious  I have also recently been getting the fajitas which are different than the standard fajitas that Im used to  The filling is mixed with a tasty tomato sauce thats a nice change  Overall this is one of my favorite places to go to in Squirrel Hill and I heartily recommend itI cant say this place is bad because its not  Its just not that good either  We had the steak tacos and the chicken mole yesterday and it was just meh  Edible but thats about it   I will say that the medium Margarita was pretty big and tasty and the mohito I had was really good  The service was relatively good but the food was just uninspired  I dont think well go backWent for lunch as I was craving a taco The hard shell was stale and I wasnt impressed with the rest of it The salsa that comes out had no flavor it seemed to just tomatoes Booooring and tasteless I will probably not be going back to see if it was a bad day as stale hard taco shells and flavorless salsa at a Mexican joint seems like blasphemy This is sad face in the flesh :"

    "review":"Another average bagel place thats located on Murray in the heart of Squirrel Hill Ive stopped in here a few times while shopping in the neighborhood or beforeafter a movie at the Manor One thing I dont like is that they close pretty early from what I remember maybe 5 or so  Otherwise make sure to Grab a bag of day old bagels which I think are only 299I have had it with this location The staff are nice but I come here on occasion to get a bagel with cream cheese for late afternoon lunches and so many times after returning to my office in the neighborhood I open up my bagel wrapper to find a smear of butter on one half and a smear of cream cheese on the otherother times like today the barelythere smear of butter on one half cream cheese on the other half ended up in me eating basically just bread I shouldnt have to oversee the process just so I ensure Im not eating half butter bread Why is it so hardThey got my order and my girlfriends order wrong on the same day Do not expect to get what you orderThe food isnt bad but everything else is  The last two times theyve provided a dreadful experience  The time before we visited they gave us the wrong order which was marked on the bag correctly  When it was confirmed by us at the cashier it was looked at and confirmed only to be taken back and wrong  When we came back there was no apology but they did fix the order  I wrote it off as a fluke  Today after about a month went back and ordered two sandwiches  One was wrong again and the other for my child was not cut like normally and they forgot to toast it  Also there was three employees in front and at least one in the back that I could see and between my two sandwiches and the other two customers it took them over 10 minutes to prepare an incorrect orderI ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese the truest test  Fortunately for me mine was just out of the oven and tasted very good  It did appear that the more exotic bagels may not have been as fresh as mine so your experience may differIm always up for a tasty bagel in the morning I pop in this location after night shifts and grab a half dozen The staff is always so cheerful and polite kinda makes me want to hurl how can anybody be happy to be up before the sun fully rises My apologies as you can gather I am not a morning personBack to the reviewmy favorite bagels are the jalapeo cheddar rosemary olive oil onion eveything oh lets just say Ive never had a brueggers bagel I didnt like Dont leave without grabbing some fresh OJ"

    "review":"This isnt my favorite coffee spot just because its so close to my house Its my favorite coffee shop because of the coffee And the very nice baristas And the delicious brekkie sammies And the chocolate chip cookies And the outdoor seating And the nice people who work there Oops I said that alreadyWonderful Lovely Quaint One of the most refreshing cafes in pittsburgh My visit was a surprise from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate fine espresso I was instantly enamored with the setup inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadnt come to our senses I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well simply to die for and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer Now if that isnt representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States then I dont know what isin the top 3 coffee spots in pittsburgh  highland park is magicStill one of the best places to get soy capps but they no longer have an extensive tea list Whats left is not a bad selection but there are dramatically less choices so its no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by US Foods or the like nothing is local Itd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally Until then it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso with nice vibes and pleasant serviceI dont drink coffee so keep moving if thats what you care about Surprisingly quiet library quiet coffee shop which is nice unless youre hoping to have a conversation without the looming selfconsciousness of being overheard Surprisingly cheap icedchilled tea There was a large group of neighbors gathering at the outside tables and a fair amount of passing conversation which suggests this might be a community gathering spot for Highland Park residents Hoping to be inspired in future visitsFinally a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee The espresso is incredible which makes for an excellent cappuccino and the food is pretty good too Croissants muffins and other baked goods top the breakfast list while madetoorder paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menuThe crowd at Enricos is varied which I really enjoy My 65yearold neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks college students techies and other folks who are looking for a good brewNo frills no extras just nice people in a quaint coffee shop brewing up warm goodness"

    "review":"I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my coworkers I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly  I found Sapporo and was very pleased It is in an odd location but once you step inside you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style My party felt the staff was very friendlyI had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster filet and shrimp We all got started with the soup and salads which was a pretty good size I didnt want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner Our Chef was one of the most personable Chefs I have encountered He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent They make their fried rice from scratch Its not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places I can definitely tell the difference My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind Dan who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldnt even finish it Actually we all needed togo boxes The portion amount here is incredible You definitely get your moneys worth hereI would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate Thank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience I will be back for sureAnhThe food was alright Not good Not bad And considering the portion the prices werent bad either The service on the other hand was terrible Severely understaffed Three hours order to check Worst of all the chef put cooked lobster tail back into the raw shell to serve it Avoid at all costsBeen to many hibachis this one is very clean the building is a little older but the family that runs it does a wonderful job I came here and got the chicken Spot on I loved the beef stew it came with I always think the salad at hibachis are real alright but the sushi was delicious and the hibachi was wonderful with delicious noodles  veggies and rice best I have had in a while because it aint too salty many times for me its too extreme on the saltFree edamame with check in so that was a plus Reasonably priced delicious Japanese goodness seemed like it also had good drinksWill returnGreat prices huge portions and friendly environment Great placeWe decided on Sapporo after reading soso reviews on Ichiban and Benihanas  This was a nice surprise Yes it is not in the best looking area and yes the restaurant may not be as nice as a Benihana  But the food was quite good  We had our doubts at first  We went in the middle of a Sunday afterfoon and the place was empty  And service seemed to be a little disorganized and distracted  But once the chef came out and got to work it was great  The salad and soup were veyr good the soup being a little more beefy in flavor than what we were used to  We then had the fried rice and got a HUGE portion  We needed a little more soy sauce that what the chef used but he gladly provided more and the rice was delicious  Then we moved to the main entrees  Wife had the Chateaubriand and I had the Tenderloin and Scallops  The meat although cooked  just a tad past medium still melted in your mouthand the scallops were absolutely the best Ive ever had  Again huge portions of meat and vegetables plus a large portion of noodles Definitely a platefulWe did not get the requisite show you get at this kind of restaurant but weve seen it so many times its kinda boring to me  Instead we had a nice conservsation with the chef about the Pittsburgh area  All in all this was a very pleasant meal and Ill definitely go backSapporo is my favorite Japanese restaurant period Ive found other places that come close but for me this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine Sapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pikes hottest tourist attraction the Pittsburgh Motel But dont let the location fool you Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere Theres a bar at the front some tables to the right and the main dining area to the left Theres also that karaoke machine Ive never seen used in all the years Ive gone hereUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga great stuff and Ichiban the cooks at Sapporo arent all about giving an extensive show while cooking Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano etc but really its all about the food which is fine by me I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and its fun to look like a goofball while trying but thats neither here nor thereThe food here is excellent Theyve introduced a new look to their menu recently I dont know if they scaled it down as I often always order from the same section I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available They used to have a full sushi bar and you can still see that when you walk in but Im not sure if theyre using it for anything other than just whats on the main menu which would be a shame if so as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu Again this may be something they still have that Im not aware ofAt any rate the starter soup and salad is great I love the bits of onion in the soup Its a very strong broth but not overpowering The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant and here I really love it but I tend to like it everywhere Ive had it so Im not a real stickler when it comes to thatUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert Either way its a great dish Ive also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as wellNow my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce I call it the magic sauce Its of the light pink variety and thin consistency Im always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either dont have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker mayonnaisebased version which is OK but doesnt come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce Apparently its a secret as to just what goes into it On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik which one of the fellow diners at my table believedSo if you get the fried rice here dump some of the magic sauce on there Its amazing Use it for your steak or chicken as well I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies which are also top notch here Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli I dont care for broccoli personally but the rest is excellentSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didnt have them as well I think they were doing fine without them as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food but they are good if unnecessaryThe steak here is great Ive had the sirloin as well as the filet I always get mine cooked rare and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber The shrimp never taste fishy and the lobster tail is similarly excellent All around you get a great meal here for the priceIm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore Sapporos a funny place in that some weeknights youll drive by and its packed and then other nights it will be quiet Id suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds Yet even when it was packed Ive never had to wait long to be seated at a tableSo if you havent been give Sapporo a try Its been there forever The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit They dont do lunches anymore so its strictly dinner meals so be looking at spending at least 2030 dollars on up for adults and around 10 or so for kids meals Its not some place you would go frequently if youre on a budget but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go"

    "review":"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh The artichoke dip mussels fries and ice cream are what I usually get and every time I order them they continue to impress me However all the dishes are delicious There is also always a wonderful variety of beers I recommend going at odd hours since they do not take reservations and the line can be outthedoorIt was one of the first nice Spring days of the year and my girlfriend and I really got the itch to dine outside and enjoy the warm weather  Ive been wanting to scope the Point Brugge Cafe out for a while now and knowing that they offered outdoor seating I decided to finally take the drive down to Highland Park  I loved the location of the restaurant  Its in a quiet little neighborhood away from the busy streets and the interior has a cozy warm feel to it  I really liked store front windows that let a ton of light in  Unfortunately we were not able to get a seat outside but we were able to snag a table right beside the windows Anyways on to the food  We did not order separate entrees for ourselves but instead ordered a few plates to share  I couldnt come here without ordering the mussels so we ordered a pound and a half of that red curry style the Asian tofu sandwich and the Seasonal Cobb Salad   We had a few beers at the bar before we were seated and I didnt exactly have an empty stomach but the portion size of the mussels blew my mind  I could have thrown in the towel after that  They were incredible and met the expectations I had coming in after reading glowing comments about them here on Yelp  The Asian tofu sandwich was tasty too and something that would hit the spot for lunch  Unfortunately the Seasonal Cobb Salad was just  nasty  First I found a long hair in my salad  The waiter took it back and gave us a new one but he didnt even apologize  And the salad itself was drenched in an incredibly powerful vinaigrette that made me sick just smelling it  My girlfriend felt the exact same way I did and we took about a half a bite each before deciding to pitch it   It definitely makes me leery of ordering a salad from here again as most of the salads they have are vinaigrette based  Maybe I should have asked for less dressing but I definitely was not expecting it to be poured on so heartily In all though I really dug the place and will come back again  Other than the salad the food was great and like I mentioned above its a cool place to eat on a nice warm day  Very inviting and pleasant atmosphere  Plus they had Bells Oberon which is one of the better warm weather beers you can find in Pittsburgh  Brownie points for carrying itI had the mussels and gnocchi I dont understand what they did to it but Ive never had gnocchi that good in my life It won my heart And endless French bread so much French bread for the sauce the mussels came in They also have a pretty good beer selection This is definitely now a new goto spotUnfortunately Im not a fan of musselsso the talked about moules frites were off the table for mehowever I was wholly impressed with my choices The macaroni gratin and roasted yam arugula salad were as good as it gets I recommend arriving early during the dinner hour during springtime as the patio tables are quite lovely Overall it was a fantastic reasonably priced meal in a welcoming comfortable atmosphereReally fantastic place to enjoy good food and drinks  The staff are mostly friendly and the atmosphere is great although sometimes chilly temperaturewise  The food is consistently great as are the drinks  Highly recommendMy wife and I dined here for Sunday brunch fittingly after I performed at Bach Beethoven and Brunch at Mellon Park in Point Breeze  I had a mimosa and the crab cakes eggs benedict  The crab cakes were full of lump crab meat and delicious  The mimosa was the right combination of orange juice and champagne  My wife had a mimosa and frittata which she enjoyed as well  Overall a great experience  I would like to try this out for lunch some time"

    "review":"Came here for my 20th birthday on a monday night with my 3 other family members Were greeted with a super friendly host that quickly sat us He then proceeded to print out a specialized menu reading happy 20th birthday Which was an awesome touch Then he came over took a picture of us printed it out and gave us a pamphlet with the picture reading happy birthday from your friends at mortons The food was honestly some of the best Ive had in my entire life Filet mignon was done perfectly the bacon mac n cheese was insanely good They gave a free HUGE piece of chocolate cake Out server was a woman named Leanne and she was AWESOME Overall great experience especially for a birthdayMy family and I came here to celebrate my sisters graduation It doesnt have a grand entrance and looks kinda like a normal holeinthewall restaurant since you have to go through a couple doors to get to the actual restaurant Pros: The food service and ambience is great We ordered so much food and had a bunch of leftovers I personally ordered the cajun ribeye and it was cooked perfectly medium rare and FULL of flavor We also got many sides such as truffle fries hashbrowns mac and cheese mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts The truffle fries were yummy but the hashbrowns were soaked in oil I did like the mac and cheese though I didnt get to try the mashed potatoes or brussel sprouts We got the hot chocolate cake and the lemon souffle for dessert The hot chocolate cake was delicious It comes with raspberries on top caramel drizzle and a scoop of ice cream on the side Definitely WORTH The souffle was light and fluffy A big contrast to the chocolate cake Oh yeah and the bread they give you to start is AMAZING Its crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside That stuff is soo good Cons: It was noisier than expected since its a classy place youd expect there to be soft jazz and people having intimate quiet conversations However it was quite loud And of course the prices are very very steep but thats expected of a steakhouse Overall: This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion if youre willing to splurge The food is so great and flavorful Overall my experience at Mortons was awesome and I will be backWe ended up at Mortons for our anniversary dinner because Meat  Potatoes was overbooked and we didnt want to wait an hour for a table  What a great decision  The service was impeccable and the food was delicious  Yes it is expensive but we were able to split an appetizer soup steak and vegetable dish for a reasonable price and didnt have room for dessert  Their portions are certainly inline with the priceTheir Lobsterbisque is basically heaven in a bowl  Dont miss it  And the Balsamic reduction on their asparagus was amazingly flavorful and clearly a true reduction and not one of those lousy cornstarch reductions most restaurants are using nowOn my way out I slipped due to my own inability to walk and fell and the response from the staff was very caring and immediate  I was impressed from the moment I walked in until the moment I walked outI had the opportunity to try Mortons food through work My experience there was all right Compared to my dining experience at Ruths Steakhouse Mortons paled in comparison The filet mignon I ordered was not cooked to the medium rare I had requested However the waiting staff provided excellent service so I have no complaints about their service There are other steakhouses in Pittsburgh that offer a better steakhouse experienceAfter originally writing this review for Open Table and not until it was completed was I informed that it had to be trimmed to a brief highlight before it would be posted FAIL OPEN TABLE REVIEWSMortons The Steakhouse to the average joe is a special occasion treat Its prices are out of this world especially when everything is a la carte The restaurantgoing public at large has gotten used to dining where choosing an entree entitles you to choose soup or salad a vegetable and a starch Ive been here before so I know not to expect anything with my steak besides a plate and flatware Oh and a napkin and to be totally honest bread and a glass complete with waterHowever since the star of the show here is steak its almost sacrilege to choose anything else Cmon the speciality of the house is right there in the restaurants name I went with the Signature Cut New York Strip To be totally frank it is quite possibly the best steak on the face of the planet It comes with a beautiful char perfectly cooked to perfection with nary a blemish to be found You will be using your knife but never to cut away grizzle or fat How does a steak taste this good chew this well and not have any fat vein Not quite sure but Morty seems to have it down to a science My companion had the Center Cut Prime Ribeye and she agreed with my assessment of perfectionI saw many of the apps and sides being delivered to other tables but after a soup which I will describe in a moment and steak who could eat so much The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail app looked tantalizing oldschool style on a widerimmed glass complete with dryiced fog effects The mashed potatoes and mac  cheese looked tempting and were large enough to feed a group but I cant attest to the flavorWe started with a loaf of exceptional warm bread with flecks of toasted onion on the crust It had a wonderful crumb and Id buy it from a bakery in a heartbeat To begin I started with the Lobster Bisque and my companion began with a CenterCut Iceberg or wedge salad The wedge seemed perfectly adequate inspire of its Flintstones size We both agreed that the Lobster Bisque was sublime It had an incredible depth of lobster stock flavor Speaking only for myself though the bisque is the main attraction the lobster island usually found floating in the middle is akin to the cherry topping an ice cream sundae And I save it for the final sayonara spoonfuls And in this case it actually took down with it what went before It was so overcooked as to be inedible and rarely is ANYTHING inedible to moi It had the mouthfeel of an underdone sponge or perhaps soggy cotton balls What a disappointment I really couldnt tell if it was over or underdoneSo that last payoff combined with the waiters neverending push to inflate the bill with dining accoutrements were the only demerits from an otherwise exceptional mealHad dinner tonight with a friend and I have had excellent meals here in the past Tonight was a good meal I play the Landry game with promotion and points many generated from happy hours at Mortons and McCormick otherwise I am priced outSix ounce filet with scallops and shrimp cooked perfectly  Sixteen Oz NY Strip cooked perfectlyLyonnaise potatoes excellent one problemmore onions thanPotato Sauteed spinach with button mushrooms excellent Desserts excellent Service was very good with four different servers nearly no bumps in service I think Wine markup is now in the 3x to 35x category Things have changed under Landrys although I am still happy with my visits"

    "review":"A nice little place good food good prices service is great  Pancakes are different but good pecan french toast was great so was the western omeletThe best place for a filling delicious breakfast I love JTs the only way it could get better is if they were to move to a bigger location They always do a great job and Ive been there probably 20 timesI have been wanting to try this local diner for a while I have heard some very good things about it I knew the place was small and would be cramped Sadly I was very unimpressed with the food My wife had steak and eggs the eggs were not cooked all the way the steak was overcooked One daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich it was bland Other daughter had chocolate chip pancakes the pancakes are very heavy not fluffy I ordered the frittata which was okay A lot of good ingredients but very bland flavorWe left wishing we would have went to one of our normal breakfast places like Frank   Shirleys or Bobs DinerOverall this was a good experience I had 6 with french toast and bacon and my companion had the same except with pancakes We had coffee and split an order of potato pancakes  The eating area is small but in a cozy way  It isnt trendy like Thai Cottage but about the same size I really liked the setupThe coffee was very good as well I like it black so really appreciate good tasting coffee  The potato pancakes were tasty and especially the bacon  The french toast was fine and used good bread  The flavor was subtle  The only complaint was with the pancakes  They didnt appear to be done and my companion could not eat them  Odd since the pancakes are very thin and looked done on the outside  We didnt complain though so I didnt factor this into my rating of 4 starsFor a hole in the wall restaurant They get it You can feel the love they put into the food I had the 20 veggie burrito the use of real eggs in this dish and not liquid eggs makes this diner very happy My wife had strawberry French toast with fresh strawberries Needless we will return to this gemI was introduced to JTs last week by a good friend of mine I had the 5 and it was delicious All it needed was a little bit of hot sauce for kick The Mancini bread was a perfect addition to the food You definitely get your moneys worth as there was easily enough for two meals Highly recommended"

    "review":"Having the ability to order through the new mobile app is definitely not only a game changer but a life changer Ordering is a breeze and youre able to customize your order any way you want If you want a ChickfilA sandwich with no pickles but bacon and cheese instead go for it the app is your oyster One of the best features of the app is curbside pickup I can order my food when im still in a nearby store or leaving work and have it ready to be delivered to my car or pickup in store when I get there No more waiting in long lines in store or through the drivethru Does it get much better than thatIt also goes without saying the their customer service at this location is hands down one of the best experiences out there today Customer service is always consistently great and everyone is beyond friendly  I cant give them enough compliments on that aloneI like when the people at a fast food place are happy Knowing that the people making my spicy chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese on a golden wheat bun  and a side of chicken nuggets are working AND dont hate their life really makes it taste that much better Also it is a small inspiration that my job probably isnt all that bad either and you cant put that kind of mental high five on the menu If Im eating fast food chicken it better be ChickFilA and this location is one of the best aroundThis place provides exceptional courteous service The line could be out the door and the employees still treat you like you matter I really like their traditional breaded chicken but their chicken noodle soup and chicken salad sandwich is also tasty The peppermint milk shake is a great holiday treatYou cannot get a better fast food experience anywhere else  This is the place to be  The service in AMAZING  they always blow away any expectations I have and they are high expectations  The food is always hot fresh fast and reasonably priced  The staff is amazing and they will even come out to your tables to give further service if needed  Cant get this level of service at the most expensive restaurants downtown sometimes  I just love everything about Chickfila and especially this location  They are all about the customer service and the details  Way to goAmazing customer service Great food Very clean if you decide to eat in This fast food chain even puts some restaurants to shameDrove through for a milkshake  Fast and friendly service  Normal Chick Fil A menu"

    "review":"Very authentic and has a homely feel to the place I highly recommend this placeZero stars for this place I had to put one because it doesnt work that way They have no professionalism or manners Their customer service was so bad we didnt even stay to finish the food We got boxes packed up the food paid the bill and immediately left in protest Firstly my friends were embarrassed by the manager who rudely interrupted them in the middle of their prayer they are muslim After ordering food my friends had specially moved out side on to the dark and wet patio for the prayerit was after sundown it had just rained and no one was there to make sure that the guests inside would not be disturbed I saw the manager take a look at them and then walk into the kitchen A few seconds later he and another female employee interrupted my friends in the middle of the prayer and forced them to go inside saying:  You cannot pray out side this is not your country this is America The people on the table next to us started staring and we sat there in silence after getting publicly embarrassed thinking how it would be completely pointless to rationally argue with this person who obviously had no concept of freedom of religion expression or speechIf that wasnt enough already the waitress was super rude to us as wellThe waitress clumsily dropped the top bread of my kofte burger on the table in front of everyone put the rest of the burger in front of me didnt even stop to apologize in courtesy or pick up the bread and just walked away I was completely stunned at this nonprofessional attitude and downright rudeness I called the waitress back and she casually asked: what do you want and I asked for a replacement on the burger to that she said:I will bring you another top part of the bread and then walked away We immediately asked for boxes when she came back with the top bread They gave us boxes after making us wait for another ten minutes we paid the bill and we quickly leftCame here and got the babaganoush AMAZING Their pita is also fantastic: warm and slightly chewy Also got the Turkish Doner Gyro plate with rice It came with a cool and refreshing cucumber yogurt that balanced out the rougher texture and savory flavor of the lamb Be aware though that the plate ONLY comes with meat and rice Thats it So if youre looking for some veggies youll have to order that separatelyThis is a great hidden gem in Shadyside We arrived around 8pm for dinner and sat on their patiowhich is perfect for warm weather dining The service is very prompt and attentive We started out with the Mediterranean dip with warm pita It was a great mix of flavors however you must like tomatoes as the main ingredient is tomato paste We ordered the doner platter to share and it came with a large amount of shaved lamb rice cacik along with grilled tomatoes and peppers The ingredients were all very fresh and tasty Make sure to order turkish coffee at the end of your meal along with some baklava Also they are byob if you are in the mood to bring along some wineReally good cheap Mediterranean food After a lot of searching and a lot of disappointing meals I was so happy to finally find this in Pittsburgh Dont let the unassuming atmosphere fool you  the food is great I especially liked the chicken kebabs which were incredibly moist And you get a ton of food for the price BYOBI moved recently to Pittsburgh and im a huge fan of The Iskander i tried one the downtown and it wasnt good i saw this restaurant in yelp and i thought ill give it a try the Iskander and the Kunafa is the BOMB You really should try them both absolutely coming back"

    "review":"An amazing view of Pittsburgh  Its true  This was my first visit to Pittsburgh and a client suggested we try Monterey Bay  Located on top of what I guest is the Mount Washington section of Pittsburgh Monterey Bay is located in what appears to be an older high rise apartment building  At the entrance you take an elevator up to the main dining room on one floor or the bar on another floor or the wine cellar on another floor  The view of the downtown three river section of the city is really quite exceptional particularly as the sun goes down  By the way the seafood was as good as or better than the viewToo uptight Not my style I guess Should have had a better dish considering what my husband and I paid View is awesome  staff and service was ok Not personable at all Probably wont come backThere is no finer place for seafood in Pittsburgh I go with my wife every year and only expect it to get better as the new renovations are completed try the Ahi Tuna sesame style Good God It is however a bit expensive Expect to drop about 200 there but in my world its worth every pennyDisclaimer:  I like shellfish but not fish  I went rogue and ordered the special which was a rib eye with garlic fries  The steak was a little fatty but still very flavorful and tender  Good drink selection  The ambiance service and view make it a 4 star55 for view Get a window seat absolutely stunning views 55 for waitstaff friendly and professional We ordered a plate of oysters that my mother deemed not fresh enough and they they immediately took it off our check35 for food What do you expect from seafood this far inland The sauce on my halibut was a little too sweet for my liking and the oysters werent fresh but otherwise it was fine not amazingSomewhere between 3 and 4 stars This is one of the best locations if not simply the best for a restaurant in Pittsburgh and if you are lucky to be close enough from a window as we were you will impress your dinner guests Now not all tables are close to the windows and some tables dont benefit from the view at all I wonder how people are assigned to tablesThe food is based on fish and the menu is impressive with a beautiful list of fish We had various fish dishes but the clear winner was the sea bass with pineapple  usually I am not a fan of pineapple in my food but this dish was very successful The other fish were good but not nearly as tasty Some were a bit bland The risotto was good the lobster mac and cheese not impressiveThe desserts are decadent  in a good and bad way They are really very sweet and heavy too much for the taste of our table Id recommend to share a few we had 3 for 5 and this was too much including angel food grilled cheese sandwich and macadamia mousse Overall the food was decent but the prices  very high for Pittsburgh  call for something better and more interesting Too many fish dishes were good but a bit blandFinally our waiter was terrible She pushed to consumption insisting that we take some appetizers she lost track of our bottle and pretended it was empty while we had only drank half of it she put water on one of us"

    "review":"Kitchy place to check out especailly during holidays when they go crazy with decorations  Try Christmas and Halloween as these are the best  Very cheap drinks and friendly bartendersThis is a magical wonderland of lights alcohol cheer and karaoke connoisseurs The building most likely shines from space with the amount of lights on the outside Inside no less lights but just add popcorn strings wrapped beams bows bells ornaments santa paintings and people dressed as santa We sat at the cramped bar in awe with giddy smiles on our faces for most of the night Just try to avoid Nick at Night  hell try to take you to Vegas and marry you the same night or pawn you off to his undertaker friend Aside from some creepy lovebirds its cheap everyone is extra friendly and there were even a bunch of Christmas tunes thrown in to the karaoke  Everyone should go here at least once Its just so festive I was so happyI love this little bar for a couple of reasons Its a very friendly place full of unpretentious regulars mostly the 30 plus crowd Drinks are cheep Id almost call it a dive but not quite because the place is always decked out beyond belief from whatever the last holiday might have been When I say decked out beyond belief I seriously mean just that Ya wont believe it The bartenders are always nice and actually know how to make drinks The bar itself is cool its a rectangular shape  so everybody is facing one another The food is very top notch although regular bar fair The only knock Ive got on the place is that it gets a little too smokey for my taste and they sometimes have karaoke which Im not always in the mood to hear If youre driving through that part of town stop in for a drink Youll enjoy itI just love this place  I rather hate Christmas but since I have family that expects me to go through the motions this is the one thing that really helps me get in the holiday spirit  Yes I could live without the smoking but Christmas would just not be Christmas without a trip to Bobs Garage  And I happen to think the burgers are  really good  You just have to see this place at Christmas to believe it  Its awesomeBobs Garage is a small cozy bar in Blaw Nox Friendly and reasonably priced Bobs offers karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights from 9 to 1:30 The appetizers look delicious The place is always arrayed in dazzling lights inside and out and is thematically seasonal A great place to meet friends and sing till the cows come homeCozy place Christmas decorations year round and great karaoke"

    "review":"This caf is amazing The cold brew coffee the maple lattesWOW Im making this my everyday coffee spot Its just so greatI wanted to make sure I gave this coffee shop several chances before writing a review Ive gone there approximately 8 times and have always had the same type of experience Pros: OK coffee great cookies cute place Thats it The first time I went it was the first day they were opened I ordered a cappuccino The barista handed me my drink and said Whoops I wasnt paying attention and made a latte by accident I took it anyway but was shocked that she didnt even ask if that was OK Every time Ive gone in Ive felt like an inconvenience to the barista One sat on her phone while I stood there waiting Another said literally nothing and just stood there looking at me Ive gotten one friendly hello from one of the baristas but thats it Would it kill any of them to smile or say Hey hows it going Its not an inviting atmosphere and only one barista seems even remotely friendly Finally I went in one more time and was utterly disgusted at the smell It smelled as though a toilet overflowed and a pack of dead animals were piled up behind the counter I was so disgusted and dont even want to know how a coffee shop usually one of my favorite smells had the ability to smell that bad Id love a good coffee shop down this end of LV and would even take a mediocre one But the unpleasant baristas and unwelcoming atmosphere is enough to make me drive to 6th Ward for coffeeGreat coffee shop  Has everything that you would want  delicious coffee cozy space nice people good music  The kind of place that makes you happy that you live in PittsburghNot a bad place Has the Lawrenceville ambiance Small cool business Barista was quite nice and talkative Lots of cool tea options and support farmshares Almond milk availableSadly my impression was tarnished by the interaction of the baristaowner with two young black girls that walked in asking for ice She replied do you have a dollar Its a pretty expensive machine But you can help yourself to water its limitless I get its a business and not free drinks place stillWish I had offered them the I probably wont be coming backI loved this place when they opened but the hours kept changing and the chairs are really uncomfortable The coffee was really good I wish there was more consistency in hours and more space because I live close by Music was really great when I was thereI love trying out new coffee places so I was excited to give Caff dAmore a visit The shop itself is small but really cozy and quaint There is a bar with stools as well as some other seating so it would be great for catching up with a friend or doing some reading with a nice warm beverage in hand I decided on an Americano and was pleased It had the perfect espressotowater ratio so that the espresso flavor was still robust and not too watery I barely added anything to it just some cream to mellow things out which shows theyre using high quality espresso that can stand all on its own The guys working were both friendly and relaxed The whole atmosphere is calm and quiet and I can definitely see myself spending more time here in the future"

    "review":"Dinette is a new restaurant in the growing East End area  Red Room Red2 Richard Chen and Typhoon are all near by While Dinette is smaller than the rest it definitely holds its ownThe menu is small and local which is a plus it was difficult to pick what to get  While most of the menu is pizza all are gourmet and very tasty  We went on a Saturday night at around 8:30 thinking that it wouldnt be too long of a wait  While the wait ended up being about 30 min the initial 1545 minute wait time frame through us for a loop  We didnt mind much since the pagers they offer give you quite the range to have a drink we headed to Kellys Bar down the street and still got the pageThe wine list has a lot to offer and the ambiance is spectacular  The simple decor and floor to ceiling windows that let you look into the kitchen are all a plus  It you dont mind waiting and you shouldnt you need to check out DinetteI figured that a second visit would bump this place up to a 5 and I was definitely correct This time around I ordered the portobello soup and the sweet potato  chorizo pizza I cant decide which was the star of the meal they were both so amazing The portobello soup was full of flavor and had a rich but not heavy consistency Easily earning a spot on the best soups Ive ever tasted list and Im king of a soup nut And the pizzathe pizza was out of this world It helps that sweet potatoes are perhaps my favorite thing on earth however these were particularly well done even for my dining companion who isnt normally too wild about the tuber roasted in strips so that they came out almost looking like a softer veggie chip The chorizo was flavorfulspicy and the peppers added the perfect extra kick This was the perfect winter night mealI will probably bump this place to five stars but Id like to wait until Ive been more than once My first impression of this restaurant however was phenomenal New top 5 favorite restaurant in Pittsburghworthy My dining companion and I started off with a salad I cant remember what exactly was in it but it contained ingredients from the rooftop garden and had the most amazing goddess dressingnot too much as it should be and beef carpaccio oh my god heavenly and served with these incredible roasted chickpeas which I may have been tempted to run back to the kitchen and steal by the bagfull For the pizza course we shared a prosciutto pizza with rooftop arugula It was delectable and you can tell the ingredients are high quality And dear lordthat mozzarella Yum Ive been staying away from sweets a bit lately but I will definitely have to come back and try their pot de creme too A diner at a nearby table had it and it looked amazing Service was great Our waiter was very helpful with suggestions and knowledgable about the menu My only downside I would say for the restaurant  and this is more of a matter of personal taste on my end  was that I wasnt wild about the decor I tend to favor a cozier restaurant and this was definitely a trendymodernminimalist feel Again thats purely personal preference and who cares when this is the best gourmet pizza Ive had in the city and perhaps one of my favorites everDinette is one of my absolute favorite spots in the East End I bring friends and family here all the time and no one has ever been disappointed Its very unassuming in its decor and I like that Not at all pretentious just fresh local ingredients used to make delicious foodI love asking the wait staff about what is going on with the rooftop garden I love knowing that what I am eating often comes from the garden on top of the restaurant Obviously sustainability is a common trend in restaurants right now but I love that Pittsburgh is picking up on those trends Yay PittsburghThe menu changes all the time depending on what is fresh and in season Although you can always depend on the pepperoni fresh ricotta and prosciutto my favorite because they are always on the menu Because I know I can come in and get the prosciutto pizza topped with fresh arugula anytime I usually try to do something different The fresh corn pizza that was on the menu earlier in the fall was absolutely spectacular with its combination of crunchy salty bacon with sweet juicy corn In October my favorite was the salami pizza with sweet potato and fennel Always ask the wait staff for recommendations because they have tasted everything and have never steered me wrongThe starters change frequently as well but the shishito pepper with Marcona almonds and goat cheese dish is usually on the menu This starter is a must I love the wine list and if you ask they will let you sample a few before deciding You must must finish with the pot de creme I dont care if youre stuffed just do it One of my favorite desserts in the cityI had never heard of Dinette until a friend suggested we dine here on Friday night I knew that the restaurant was within walking distance of my friends house so I just assumed that was most of its appeal However this restaurant isnt just about convenience It definitely stands on its own and would be worth a drive to dine hereThe space is pretty small and probably seats around 50 or so people My friend was concerned that we might have a 30 minute wait for dinner on a Friday night but we were seated within a couple minutes The decor was cute and trendy and actually reminded me a bit of IKEA with modern style chairs and unique lightingThe group ordered three different pizzas among the four of us and I had the opportunity to try them all They were all delicious My favorite of the three was one that I believe was called Grilled Corn It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet My husband ordered the Toy Box Tomato Between the brie and various spices it had incredibly unique flavor Finally I had the Fresh Ricotta Though very simple the ricotta on top was delicious and really  as the name suggests  fresh Even though I dont live within walking distance I definitely want to come back to Dinette in the future There are a lot more pizzas on the menu that need to be triedFood here is awesome It can get crowded but its worth the waitNot great for large parties but awesome for catching up with a friend"

    "review":"Seeing that fall is in full swing I stopped by Donatos last week for their delicious Fall Harvest Salad with roasted pumpkin bourbonpoached pear and shaved red onion on a bed of arugula tossed in a house made pumpkinsage vinaigrette It was a nice big portion that was definitely big enough to satisfy two hungry people The bourbonpoached pears elevated the salad from standard to stellar and brought memories of the holiday season  Not only was the food great but the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable Donatos has a very nice extensive wine list with customized wine bottles from the Pittsburgh Winery I enjoyed my salad with a glass of Merlot from the Pittsburgh Winery  The fullbodied red wine complimented my salad beautifully Overall I enjoyed my experience and will be back againCame here on 517 with a large group Not knowing what to expect but with an open mind I noticed right away from the decor that this is a classy joint As far as ambience and service I really have no complaints However seating is extremely cramped OK I can look past that So the group orders the bone marrow for an appetizer as recommended by our waitress As it went around I decided to pass as did a few others as it did not appeal to me Those who did eat it were not impressed I did not hear anyone say Wow this is great For my meal I kept it simple A New York Strip medium with garlic butter A whopping 43 Now Ive been to my share of highend steakhouses so for 43 I had some pretty high expectations It came with a salad I had a choice between soup or salad The salad was bland and dry OK no big deal because the steak is coming right WRONG The steak arrived overcooked to the point where there was no pink center at all It was beyond well done It didnt taste much better either Im guessing the cook just threw a hunk of beef in the oven and then added garlic butter afterwards for some flavor No char at all on the outside and overcooked on the inside And I call him a cook because he or she is definitely not a chef This steak was on par with one you would get at Dennys This restaurant is very underwhelming for such a high price tag I felt like we paid for a Rolls Royce but received a Yugo They must not have much competition in Pittsburgh because this place wouldnt survive anywhere else One member of our group did not join us When I saw him the next day he said Ive been there before I wasnt impressed with their food I totally get that nowWe took our family here last night to celebrate Mothers Day  There were 4 people in our party that got Lobster Bisque with their entree  The waiter Andrew said it would be a slight upcharge for this soup versus the wedding soup  We said sure thats fine not thinking it would be 8 for a cup and 16 for a bowl  The most expensive steak houses in the US dont even charge that much  The service was very poor too  Our waiter rolled his eyes when we asked for more water and butter  To top off the night the pasta dinners were served cold  We were visiting from Michigan and wanted a nice evening with our family  Good thing the company was great because this place was awful  Overpriced and will not go backHad dinner here tonight to celebrate a graduation Menu had wide range of choices We had a big party so we tried steaks veal lamb pasta and everything else Not a single complaint from anyone in out me party of 11 Loved the stuffed hot pepper as well as the meatball appetizers I had the 8oz filet with truffle fries and sauce which was cooked to perfection but I think the marinated lamb chops may have been the favorite in our group Go here nowThis is a high end restaurant The food service is excellent Dinner is an enjoyable experience Along with the experience is a check to match Rarely do I get away for less than 120 for twotax and tip Thats one drink each and one desert But with a dozen raw oysters at 24 I tip 20 and tax is 7 hereI wish I could afford this more often if you have a special occasion or are in a higher tax bracket than I am you cant go wrong hereHad stopped going to Donatos about a year ago as food service and ambiance became mediocre at best When we heard there had been some major changes head chef Donato leaving we decided to give it another tryresult further dissapointmentSat at bar and was a good 15 minutes before even offered a menuthen we were asked if we wanted a small bread basket which we said yes please only for it to never materializefinally ordered and by then my wife was so annoyed she just orders a cup of soup and a zucchini appetizerher soup was SCALDING HOT and first wedding soup we have had that no meatballs at all were presentmy soup was very coldhow does that happenI ordered a half dozen oysters on half shell that like the bread basketNEVER SHOWED UPHad 2 8oz stuffed lobster tails which were just OK at bestonly highlight of dinner were the Margarita cocktails but they should have been at 13 eachnow to get the check became another mission as honestly we were totally ignored it seemedfinally paid check and headed outhostess at front stand could not have had a more miserable expression and attitude which both of us picked up on separatelyneedless to say we will NOT be back againmanagment take noteyour surviving only due to no other real higher end option in the areashame as could be a go to spot but that isnt happening"

    "review":"Very dirty  Ordered a salsad to go A fly came out of my salad Dont eat there you will be very sickShame on you MAcdonaldService is good food was okay Trashy people running around inside barking at employees But what do you expect from a McDonaldsI am s regular customer for breakfast  today I ordered my usual breakfast sandwich and a large half and half sweet tea with a little bit of ice What I got was a cup of ice a little bit of tea even though I repeated it several times the employee told me there was just a little bit of ice This was of course bullshit And these people Want 15 an hour Bring on the kiosksI was in there today at lunchtime and ordered the following:Ranch Wrap  Grilled ChickenFriesSodaWhoever rolled this thing doesnt know what the hell they were doingAre you the only person at this location who HASNT rolled a jointI know most of you are only working there so the welfare ppl dont take your bennies away but at least PRETEND like you give a damn about what you doThe wrap fell apart as soon as I opened the container  I did not go to the mgr as I was in a hurry  Suffice it to say I will not patronize this McDonalds ever againThis review is also going to McDonalds Corporate websiteIts a McDonaldsif you dont know what a McDonalds is please return to your home planetor at least do some research on ours  Do not entertain this location if you are looking for fast service  Im writing this review on a single visit as I am unlikely to return to this particular franchise  I was here on a Friday morning at 6:44 AM and the place was relatively slow for a downtown location there was approximately 5 patrons ahead of me at the time  I call that out to really highlight the next portion during this visit I ordered 2 Egg White Delight sandwiches  I then proceeded to wait for 14 minutes before they were ready there were several other patrons also waiting for the same sandwich for a similar extended period        Whoever is managing the kitchen at this particular location has done a poor job  It was clear that the runner at the front was doing her best to keep the anxiously waiting patrons happy as she stood there occasionally yelling the remaining items she was waiting on  This woman deserved praise for her attempt to help keep the customers happy as her kitchen failed her       This is a McDonalds and therefore is reviewed as such while I am not expecting 5 star dining I am expecting a quick in and out experience otherwise I would go to another establissme  especially with all the choices downtownThe food is the foodMcDonalds corporate standard The Big Mac could have been warmer and the Manager who waited on me could learn how to interact with customers Slow service and uncaring employees and management This coupled with the temperature of the food is enough to make me stay away"

    "review":"Worst place ever Went in for happy hour and the bartender got an attitude when we asked for the happy hour menu Then he proceeded to make a comment that the happy hour wine I just ordered was subpar The last thing I want after a long day is to deal with a rude waiter who thinks people ordering from a happy hour menu are not worth his time or general respect We left and called the manager who basically didnt care about the bartenders lack of professionalism Ill never go back particularly since there are plenty of other great places to go in Pittsburgh where the service is professional and respectfulMy family and I had the chefs tasting menu here which consisted of eight courses The decor was clean and modern and the service was very good It was nice that the executive chef or the pastry chef personally came out to present every dish of the tasting menu to usGenerally the food was always good and the presentation was nice though there was some variation in quality between courses Portion sizes were larger than expected By the time we were served the meat course we were all starting to get uncomfortably full So pace yourself and dont eat too much bread though the bread assortment is quite goodComments on the specific courses: The soup was poured tableside Tasted like a more refined less salty and fatty version of a french onion soup The best part was actually the simplicity of the fresh mushrooms and spring vegetables Roasted bone marrow was good but not great It wasnt as wonderfully fatty as I wanted it to be The onion marmalade made the dish for me adding a muchneeded sweetness to balance out everything The chef shaved fresh white truffle over the risotto tableside I really liked this course The risotto was creamy with a deep parmesan and truffle flavor It was also cooked perfectly Only comment is that it was a tad too salty  The scallops were beautifully seared I thought that the pea puree was a bit sweet I actually preferred to eat the scallop by itself Palate cleanser featured edible flowers Very interesting and unique The bitterness of the flowers were balanced nicely with the sweetness of the foam and the tapioca crumbles Job well done in terms of successfully cleansing our palates Duck was very good and seasoned well Skin was crispy and the ratio of meat to fat was nice I loved the beets and quinoa accompaniments as well Cheese course: Three different cheeses served with a jam macadamia nuts and crisp toast My favorite was the truffled asiago Dessert was indian spiced donuts served with some sort of berryrose sauce The donuts were not sweet at all and had a great texture perfectly fried It paired nicely with the sweetness of the sauce I thought that the presentation sort of lacked on this one since they used the same bowl and setup as that of the soupSo my family and I had a good meal here There were some interesting combinations of flavors some that worked for me and some that didnt But I liked the fact that the chef wasnt afraid to take some risksThis was a great eating experience Started with the fiox and the salad Foix is rich and tasty We then had the scallops and the steak Scallop dish might be the best Ive ever had The Swiss chard with the scallops is a great pairing and the sweet potato puree is like desert with your dinner the steak dish has a blue cheese hash that is ridiculously flavorful and pairs perfectly with the steak Service was fantastic Ali rocks And cam from the kitchen came out to provide a little personal touch along with JP Cool drink selections as well Very happy with our overall night and definitely suggest it for a romantic night outMy go to place when in Pittsburgh had been Eleven Over time it has deteriorated with both food and service I ate at Nine On Nine last week Food and service were superb I travel a lot and have eaten at the best restaurants in many cities and countries Nine on Nine ranks high among the bestWe sat outside it was lovelyGastronomy refinement and diversity are the words I would use to describe 9 on 9The Dinner menu has 3 sections Warm Cold and Entre  The warm consists of items that could be appetizers but are a bit large to just be that they would make a great bar meal mostly ranging from 1216The entres are a bit higher priced at 2530 but are well worth it I had the Barramundi 28 that came on a bed of potato risotto green beans and was garnished with basil caviar which was made using some food science trickery The fish was seared with a nice curst yet soft and flakey inside the potatoes were just right firm and packed with a stubble flavor The basil caviar was a fun and flavorful garnishMy coworker had the salmon served with seared bock choy  green beans and a mushroom corn sauce The portion looked huge and it was topped with a foam 26The ambiance matches the food dim modern yet luxurious Great for a date celebration meal or just a great meal outve only been once for happy hour but I loved it  Plus who has a SATURDAY happy hour  Nine on Nine does  We sat outside so I cannot speak for the interior but the little patio at 6 pm was perfect for people watching and enjoying the Pittsburgh summerI do wish the meters on the street were available during that time on weekdays but theyre not so parking is more than 2 wherever you park on a weekday  However on Saturday they areMy girlfriend and I had 3 items off the happy hour appetizer menu mussels ceviche and salmon pizza and I had two drinks  All of it was very good  The service was superbIm so glad that high end restaurants offer REAL happy hours not this 50 off well drinks crap with excellent deals so that I dont have to save the experience for an anniversary or something  Cheers to them"

    "review":"I went in today for lunch and was the only person in the restaurant around 2:30 pm  Since it was post lunch during the holidays I wasnt too surprised to see the place empty  I approached the gentleman at the register to place a takeout order  I ordered Pad Thai Spicy 5 and it was finished within 10 minutes which was nice  I took it back to my office to eat it and it was good but not spicy at all  The gentleman working even asked if Id like it extra spicy and I agreed  This was disappointing as there was no spice to my pad thai at allSince it was only their second day open it could have been an error  I am willing to try it again  The restaurant was very clean and the man working was very niceMy boyfriend was very pleased with the Pho and I was very pleased with the Tom Yum The Bubble Tea was on point We did pick up and though the restaurant was empty indicative of most restaurants as a bad sign it was still good service and good foodI love spicy food but the Penang curry was too spicy that even eating it with white rice wasnt enough The chicken spicy basil fried rice was flavorful The Thai iced tea was the right amount of sweetWent here for lunch today for the first time Not good I was hoping this would better in order to save some walking when I needed a Thai food fix  but looks like Ill be walking further to Nickys or Siam The prices were reasonable lunch crowd is sparse at least before noon and the place looks nice The places purely loses points for the food and that is what matters most They start you with an egg drop soup or an iceberg salad with some sort of spicy mayo salad dressing Neither sound traditional to me I got the salad and it was OK Next I went for the Pad Thai with a spice level 4 scale is 15 It was somewhat familiar to what I consider Pad Thai but the flavor seemed a little weak it was a bit dry and it was lacking the abundance of toppings I am used to from other local favorites Also the spice level wasnt quite hot enough for me but Im sure I couldve ask for some extra spice if I wanted but it wasnt a huge concern to me If the price was better Id be more ok with these things but it is the same as the aforementioned better Thai restaurants downtownThe service is terribly slower than a snail Been close to 30 mins and the only thing we have on our table a glass of water and empty salad bowls It took 10 mins to even order our food The waitresses are all new and dont have a clue on whats on the menu Will update the review once we have our foodUPDATE: After waiting for almost 75 mins we had to come out There was no point in waiting there for the food The restaurant was hardly packed and the cook has not even started on our order Pathetic service I wish I could give no stars at allStopped in to Irrawaddys for lunch today and I had a much different experience than Praveen  I got greeted quickly by a cheerful hostess got seated and my order was taken relatively quickly I choose the Mongolian Beef 3 out of 5 on the spice level and I had a choice of egg drop soup or salad to start with I choose the salad which was slightly bigger than what Ive gotten at Nicky Thais It came with lettuce red cabbage tomato and carrots The dressing was sweet creamyIt took less than 10 minutes for my Mongolian Beef to be served The beef was well done as I had requested and it was mixed with tomato scallions carrots and sliced peppers in a tangy brown sauce with a mound of white rice on the side Delicious My only complaint is that I thought the serving portion was a bit on the slight side I didnt walk away hungry but I would have welcomed moreNicky Thais is still the golden standard as far as Im concerned for Thai food in the Burgh But Irrawaddys with their varied menu to include sushi is a nice change of pace Im sure that Ill be backTotal bill for lunch excluding tip was 900"

    "review":"Cool little pizza shop run by some Greek fellas I believe  Dont let the looks of the place fool you their pizza is very good as well as their hoagies and other items  I eat here atleast once a week for lunch  Its right by my school  thumbs upGreat pizza and gyros at very reasonable prices I would highly recommend if youre looking for something simple and goodNot many pizza places left in this area but this one has managed to survive many eras Ive had it a few times and its OK Nothing special but not terrible Parking has become atrocious on the block in front of the placeThis pizza is good but not what Im used to If youre looking for a crispier crust this would not be the place for you I havent tried the hoagies and other menu items I might come back and try the hoagies and update my review Everyone has different tastes I think that the pizza could have been cooked a tad bit longer It was just a little bit doughy for meYum We just tried this place for something new and it was great I was glad to find that this place has its own unique style and it didnt disappointAs recommended by another reviewer we got a white pizza with feta and it was scrumptious Garlicky flavorful and creamy I also LOVED that the crust was kind of parbaked and doughy Give me more crustWhen we ordered we didnt have cash no online ordering the only minor let down but the guy on the phone said we could pay by card when it was delivered We did but the sweet delivery man left too quickly before we could tip We will be ordering again and tipping extraNikis is pretty decent The place needs a overhaul Its looking a little dated inside The two guys working there were pretty friendly and the food was OK The place is pretty conveniently located in the west end near some cool piano shops and not too far away from a park with a basketball court and some tennis courts"

    "review":"This is a great place to get standard Americanstyle Chinese food It is very inexpensive and they make the food when you order it instead of taking it from a pan thats been in a warmer all day Great lunch specialsThis was the worst Delivery was fast the quality  of food was  not anything to write home to We spent 40 dollars to dump it in the trash We order hot sour soup general tso and egg rollsVery good the delivery guy always gets to our house in Morningside within 30 minutes awesome serviceThis is my favorite Americanstyle Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh Ive eaten at quite a few and this place is cheap consistent and everything is freshly made right when you order it yes its frozen but they dont do that giant vat of crap simmering all night thing The family that runs the place is really nice and they are quick and efficient If youre looking for gourmet youre at the wrong place  but if you just want solid tasty cheap Chinese food China Lins the right placeAs a highlight  their lunch specials at 495 and you get a TON of food GREAT place for lunchGood prices big portions and a friendly staff Pickup for my takeout order was quick 10 minutes I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and it was really good Not too greasy My wife and kids ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and it was good also The chicken was fresh and tasted great however my wife thought the sauce was a little runny but still really good She prefers thicker sauce The egg rolls were also very tasty also not too greasyIts not fancy and in the middle of a somewhat junky shopping center but they have seating inside and do takeout They also do delivery I believe All in all its a great standard American style Chinese restaurant  Well definitely go backThey have a huge menu the prices are awesome and the bathrooms are always clean They do have a delivery charge but 99 of the time I pick up the order or have someone pick it up for me  They used to have a buffet but they stopped it a couple of years ago at one point they had the unit next door formerly Curves and tried to make it a larger dinein section but most people wanted delivery or takeout Not sure if the wonton soup is homemade or not doubt it and the eggrolls shrimp are frozen but what do you want for 135  If you are ordering any of the beef and broccoli or similar plates and you dont like a variety of vegetables carrots green peppers onion mushroom etc you have to tell them when you order  Even when I tell them no green pepper or no onion sometimes it gets added so call them and check the receipt to make sure the order was taken correctly I am giving them five stars for fast pick up service low prices and friendly wait staff if you are eating in The only con is they dont have fountain soda any more so if you order something thats hot or spicy you might have to get an extra bottle of soda"

    "review":"Interesting place the drinks are good one of the few lounges in pittsburgh  Cant go wrong  Ill be backI am visiting Pittsburgh for my sisters engagement party This place was just opening when I moved from Pittsburgh to Tampa My sister reserved an area for all of us and it was a nice set up Nice lounge feel and the food we had was unique and flavorful I really liked every thing that I tasted I heard for their happy hour they offer the food similar to what we ate for 1 each So you could order a whole tray for 20 When I glanced at the drinks they were very reasonable I dont drink alcohol but everyone seemed to think they were reasonably priced Not very strong though They waitress was able to give me coffee The only thing was the music was playing low and like 80s music at one point It was weird Kind of a boring crowd but nice for a pre game spot or the starting point for a celebration The balcony they have looked over market square and it is a nice scenery for pictures I also saw the have a back speak easy room with a flat screen tv I am not sure if everyone is allowed to go back there We ended up staying there until 11 and hitting up another spot I am pleasantly surprised at how much downtown Pittsburgh has improvedI was super surprised by this place It had good drinks but started off a little slow The music picked up and the place was awesome for dancing the crowd got more lively and the drinks were reasonably priced I thought bottle service was going to be crazy expensive but you can get the house champagne for about 35 and it makes the experience fun without breaking the bank Lots of bachelorette parties on the night we were there but I had a large group with me and everyone had a blast Totally planning a return tripEh Ill say first that Im a little biased Ive worked in Champagne lounges in NYC Paris and San Diego so my experience with bubble bars is probably a bit more extensive that the average person That being said I was a little disappointed to walk in on a Saturday afternoon and feel like I was imposing on a notyetstarted party Clearly this place does a good clubnightlife business but I didnt get the impression that it was really the spot for a casual coupe de champagne Id like to have more options that just hanging out at the bar as it was obvious they were gearing up the floor and DJ for the night The menu was ok being that I seek out more obscure bubblies I didnt really see much that peeked my interest I will say that for the average drinker Im sure their menu was well equipped to please I dont recommend this place for those looking for an indulgent cozy lounge to enjoy a little bubbly It was a little to clublike for thatDecor is fresh an fun plenty of space an seating I was part of a private party on a Saturday evening everyone was friendly a attentive Would have been a 5 star experience but the food wasnt that awesome Ordered the California  It was 34ths bread 3 shrimp an a dash of avocado The ingredients make for a tasty mix but the huge shell the wrap this way to huge for the tiny portion of ingredientOverall great place Ill just be sure to grab a bite to eat beforeWe went here last night after the super awesome Yelp event to have a cocktail  We were greeted by Shawn a very hospitable bartender  He was great  My friend and I were literally the only people there  The ambience was like a nightclub with neon lights and modern furniture strategically placed to leave enough for a dance floor It was a little too bright for my liking  We didnt try any of their food or their champagne cocktails I was in the mood for beer  I had a Southern Tier Pumking with a side of Fireball  Yum  Perfect ending to my evening  Would definitely go back to visit Shawn and try some of their menu"

    "review":"Ive lived in squirrel hill for two years and yet didnt know about this place until recently  if you go its in one of the stores between coffee tree roasters and the PNC bank but the restaurant itself is in the basement so all you see in a small sign i had the gyro platter which to be honest wasnt great  the three other people with me really liked their dishes though so maybe I just picked a bad menu choice  The hummus was fine as an appetizer but nothing great  I would probably rank this below aladdins which is just down the street closer to shady  BYOB corking fee is 2 i thinkA true hidden gem in pittsburgh The food is outstanding Must try the veggie grape leaves best I ever had The owner makes all of the food herself and orders food fresh daily The business is family owned and operated which makes for a nice family oriented environmentCame here for dinner on a Saturday night after we had already had appetizers in the Squirrel Hill night market Would definitely not come back First of all the tables were not clean and it was sticky The ambiance was a let down felt the place was so dull Coming to the food we were surprised to see the dinner portions so pricey It was about 1822 The waitress did tell us that 2 people can share one plate and we did that We ordered the shish tawouk which are marinated chicken breast on a rice pilaf The hot sauce they gave on the side tasted like straight up marinara sauce When we asked for some other hot sauce they didnt have any and gave us regular bottled hot sauce The chicken was grilled well but wasnt flavorful Finally the check was handed to us when we were through 75 of the meal We usually like to get a dessert in a Mediterranean place and felt we were being rushed out I agree with fellow yelper Jane regarding this point There are tons of good Mediterranean options in the area and I dont see what better this place has to offerFood was just ok Atmosphere not what I would consider very clean Service was terrible Only one other family in there No refills asked for pita bread for our appetizer of humus 3 separate times Brought our bill before we received the pita Then never came back to collect paymentJust left money on the table and plan on never returningIm giving this place 35 stars mainly because the stuffed grape leaves were amazing They came out and were surprisingly hot temperaturewise Id go back to have those grape leaves again We also got a shawarma wrap and a falafel wrap and they were ok but nothing special I wish they had better sauces The baklava was good super sweet but they give you a very small piece good or bad thing depending on your perspective so its not overwhelmingThe service was not that great We had to ask for lots of things and there was this feeling that we were being rushed out when we wanted to order dessertAmbiance was average It was kind of fun finding this restaurant though The underground location makes it feel more specialHands down this foodies favorite place to eat  I travel often for work and for as many of times I make attempts to try other Mediterranean restaurants I am always disappointed and return back to Pittsburgh and crave the flavors from here  Its always a treat and love being able to support locally owned small businessesMy favs are Mousaka with ground meat potatoes onions and zucchini  Schwarma shredded lamb wrapped in Pita with tahini grilled chicken rice green beans with tomato sauce those are just to name a few  The rice pudding and baklava to wrap things upIf your ever in the Shadyside area or are able to make the trip a definite must I travel 3040 minutes at least once every couple weeks to get my fix"

    "review":"Great place to get a fast healthy lunch  Their salad bar is amazing with so many options  I love the custom option that lets you add whatever you want for a set price with the exception of some premium items like the meats and shrimp that cost extra  I really like how they will chop the salad for you to your desired size and add in your desired amount of salad dressing so you can get it exactly the way you want it  I found the medium level salad dressing to be slightly heavy so Ill probably go for light in the future They also have some breakfast sandwiches probably not quite so healthy  There is a soda fountain machine offering an interesting selection of natural sodas  The line can get pretty long during peak weekday hours but it moves quickly but if you avoid peak lunch times then you can get in and out of there pretty fast  All the staff are friendly and the ingredients are really fresh  There is also a small seating areaHuge salad bar Fresh food to eat in and to go Vegetarians rescue in otherwise not too vegetarian neighborhood Quick service If you just want to grab a quick bite at a reasonable price this is the place to go Note: their salad servigs are huge Ask for a to go box and you probably have enough for a light dinnerCustom salads with all of the toppings you can think of including chickpeas quinoa and lentilsnot to mention over twenty dressing options They cost about 10 but the salads are large and very filling even if you dont pay extra for meat Add a soft drink and take in all of the delicious soda flavors This is a favorite spot of mine in case you cant tell I go after the gym for a healthy meal or during lunch hours at work They now allow you to order ahead of time online so theres no excuse not to goPerfect salads I went there for lunch and ordered the Caribbean shrimp salad I dont usually have salads but Ive gained some weight last two weeks so I decided to add salads on my diet this week And as a person who HATES greens I would highly recommend their salad to everyone The food tastes fantastic and the salad size is huge that anyone can be satisfiedI was very happy with my experience here They were very accommodating when I asked about vegan options They asked nearly the entire staff to figure out if the veggie burger was vegan which was incredibly nice its vegan by the way without the mustard They were also knowledgeable about what is vegan or not It was good I just wish there was more lettucegreens or tomatoes in the burger My friends the nonvegans also enjoyed their meals and they liked the plates they came onFrom the outside looking in this place does not give you a burger joint aura if you know what I mean but I was definitely surprised The fries are pretty good as well"

    "review":"First time in PA Pittsburgh Came in to relax awesome place Awesome customer service friendly crowd booom hookah flavor lasted for ever we left and the flavor was still good over all loved it and the leather comfy coaches was perfectid only turn up the music louderPretty good and chill Was kinda in a sketchy neighborhood but you felt safe inside The people are nice enough but not rude They play lots a rap but not too loud Lots of Arabs in there but its all goodThis place is pretty cool to hangout with friends and smoke a hookah with Food is okay not like its a 5 star restaurant but not like chucke cheese pizza You have to be 18 and they have a lot of flavors to smoke can be a little rough on the treat the first couple of times but yeah Its not badIt is very easy to find I came on a monday night and the place wasnt to busy It has a nice relaxed vibe to it There is a decent selection of tabacco Mostly Starbuzz and Al Faker The staff was very friendly and even made some great suggestions for flavors Only 5 to try a different flavor after the initial price Free wifi and its pretty cleanThe only down side would be the seating The seats arent really that comfortable when compared to other Hookah bars that I have been to Also it was a little warm in the store So that is my reason for 4 stars todayWorst place everHookah sucksssService is terrible The guy literally told me not to come back if I was not happy Seriously  not okay Lack of professionalism Best hookah in Pittsburgh  Great service and atmosphere which varies depending on when you go  Weekday nights are more chill and relaxed with Friday and Saturday nights having more of a party atmosphere with a live DJ  Like I said by far best tasting and longest lasting hookah in Pittsburgh  Great service means getting coals regularly to keep it going  The hookahs themselves are of the highest quality keeping the tobacco going much longer with a much better taste It is also BYOB so stop in at the nearby bars or distributor and they will stash your beer for you  Prices are also really reasonable  We cant stay away"

    "review":"Pittsburghs worst restaurant   I will not bore you with all the details that go along with a bad review because it is obvious that is all related to poor service food and pricing  In which Dorothy Six rises to failure in epic proportions  First of all dont kid yourself homestead 8th Ave is not even close to being the  next Lawrenceville  renovation   This by no means is a safe area not by day  and most definitely not by night  THIS IS ONE RESTAURANT TO AVOID   I would expect all the good reviews are from friends and family  Cross this place off your listFood excellent atmosphere is really neat but 23 times Ive been there service was extremely slow An hour or more to get foodIf youre like me you are looking through the reviews for Dorothy 6 seeing the mix of 12s and 45s and wondering why there is such a mix of opinions  After taking my boyfriend Dale to Dorothy 6 for his birthday last night here is my insight:Food  drinks:  5 starsValueAffordability:  5 starsAtmosphere:  4 starsService:  1 starThe food and cocktails were wonderful  We started with the Spinach  Artichoke Bruschetta which was fantastic  topped with goat cheese balsamic baconmmm bacon is a key ingredient at Dorothy 6  We followed the appetizer with the Crispy Chicken Parmesan for me Dorothy Flat Iron Steak for him  The breading on the chicken was delicious as was the marinara sauce and pasta  Dale ordered his steak rare and it came out perfectly done  He subbed in the brussel sprouts for the veggies that typically come with the flat iron steak and what a great decision that was  topped with bacon and deliciousness  To accompany our food we each had an Old Fashioned which were well made  Dale also had a draft the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout  a great beer from the restaurants reasonably diverse offering of drafts and I had a Smokestack Martini dessert in a glass to round out our eveningThe atmosphere is good  It seems like the restaurant hasnt fully decided what it is yet as there is a little bit of a clash between the cool brick walls and art the fun chandeliers and the kind of cheap banquet hallstyle chairs and tables  I suspect that as the restaurant develops the style and atmosphere will evolve furtherThe pricing is very affordable  Our bill came to about 75  for an appetizer two entrees three craft cocktails and a decent beer it doesnt get much better than thatHeres why you see the 12 star reviews:  The service is abysmal  The restaurant was not busy while we were there but the wait staff was not attentive  It took a long time just to get water after we were seated  When our food eventually came out we ultimately grabbed sets of silverware from a nearby table as we did not have any and our waitress didnt return to our table for another 10 minutes or so Asking for additional water for another drink throughout our meal was a challenge as our waitress returned our table very infrequently and spent a lot of time with her back turned to us talking to the bartender  I think next time we will sit at the bar in hopes of better service  If you are not in a hurry  perhaps youre looking for a place to relax and eat a good meal or have some cocktails after some time in the Waterfront I would highly recommend Dorothy 6  However if you have a deadline eg if you are planning to see a movie within the next hour at the theater I would probably choose another place  Overall though  lets revisit how awesome the food and drinks were  The food truly was outstanding the cocktails were well made and the prices were very affordable  If Dorothy 6 improves on service this could easily be a 5 star restaurant  It is a great addition to Homestead and I am looking forward to returningMy salmon sandwich was decent nothing special Our food came out way before our appetizer which was odd The waitress apologized and asked if we still wanted it Uhh yes I still want it haha For the appetizer we got the spinach artichoke brucshetta and it was very good Didnt try any drinks The decor and ambiance were niceHorrible service Had to beg for water refills which came in a carafe without ice No ice refills Food might have been good if served when it was freshly cooked Plates were super hot but food wasnt leading me to believe that they had sat under a heat tray for awhile End result was dried out bland food Prices were high for what we got We will not be backI had a blast at Dorothys its very sophisticated I also enjoyed my food my bartender  my Carmel apple martini Im currently putting a gathering together just to get back for that meatloaf thats described to die forI mean this hidden jewel in the middle of homestead which Ive visited there frequently never stumbled across this well lit extremely clean setting Looking forward to my next visit"

    "review":"The service is a little gruff here at least in my experience but the pizza is deliciousand cheap  Eight bucks and some change for a large cheese pizza with a perfect cheesetosauce ratio and a nice thin crust  And cheese cuts are one buckWorkers were really nice and the pizza was great Would definitely order from againPizza Italia is one of the best pizza joints around Their sauce is the best part but you can tell the ingredients are fresh A real solid piePizza I has always been a staple in our household When you walk in youre greeted as if youre family The pizza is decently priced and they always have something cold to drink My absolute favorite is extra cheesepepperoniwelldoneThis is the best pizza in Pittsburgh They use only the freshest ingredients and are reasonably priced I love the combination of freshly grated cheeses and homemade pizza sauce  The owners are friendly and have been in the business for a long time The service is spectacularI recommend mushroom pepperoni or sausage toppings and steak or Italian subs  Grew up in Pittsburgh always going to this pizza shop and anytime I came home from college and hometown visits even now we always get pizza and subs from Pizza Italia  Definitely a hidden gemPepperoni pizza is great and I love the steak hoggies with extra steak Mmm   The food does not cost the earth Pizza and the rest of the food is the Best you will find in this area Other places cost more but there not as good  The staff are always on the ball "

    "review":"I dont know what happened but this location has gone from the fastest service to the slowest With only one person in line ahead of you you can still expect to wait five minutes to get out of thereNext time Im going to the McDonalds next door Egg and bacon were heated up in a microwave Egg was greenish bacon was fatty and chewyThe people at this Brueggers were much friendlier than the ones Im used to visiting in the Philadelphia areaMy food was served quickly and tasted fine You wont be disappointed but its nothing spectacularThe friendly employees and the good food are two reasons why you should definitely give this place a tryIm obsessed with Brueggers As a New Yorker this is the best a girl in Pittsburgh is getting to a real bagel I think everyone who works at this location is so friendly Especially with the amount of students that come through and sometimes the long lines they always have a smile on their faces and a positive attitude It is also clean which is surprising with the amount of people coming through Its the best place to sit read a book or studyI have an obsession for the Chai Tea which I find to be priced pretty well I really cant get enoughI just hopped in this place while exploring my new area although its a little far from my actual hood to get an iced tea and replenish those bagel carbs I missed so desperately in China I guess timing was a little off since it was around 2 pm because there werent a whole lot of choices and what I ended up with didnt taste incredibly fresh I would definitely try this place again at a more normal feeding time to prove myself wrong  In terms of sandwiches they had some variety but those were a little priceyFirst of all the place is smelly  It smells like feet and wet cardboradI bought a plain bagel with cream cheese turkey and tomatoe It was decent However I bought chocolate milk and I did not notice it was expired until I tasted it It was gross They asked if I wanted to exchange it but I noticed all the milk cartoons were expired Then my friend ordered a cinnamon bagel and he wanted it toasted and they said no because it would catch on  fire cos it has sugar on top Instead they microwaved it which left it slimy and gross He returned it and the women seemed quiet annoyed"

    "review":"Ive been to a few different Jimmy Johns locations but this is my favorite Maybe because its very close to my work but also maybe because its very clean and the service is always friendly I get the same thing every time the beach club and Ill continue to get this item every time The bread is soft and addicting and Ive never received a bad order Even when my order is delivered I still get delicious sandwiches in a freaky fast amount of time Great job guysI know this location has been open for a while now but let me start out my review by saying that my coworkers and I were PUMPED when we heard that JJ was opening up across from our office  Since then Ive visited many many times and I love how solid JJ is  You know its going to be fast and delicious every time Even if there is a long line you get through pretty quickly  The cashiers are helpful too  Theres plenty of seating inside and out  JJ chips are super delicious too so dont make the same mistake I just made add them to your order  Lastly I love the building this location is in the Union Trust Building thankfully its undergoing renovations and will be back to its old glory very soon  There is scaffolding in front of JJ but dont let that deter you its no big dealNot sure what the fascination with this place is  I got the Vito Sub  It was an italian sub  The bread was hard and not great and I do like French Bread so that wasnt the problem  Saw them make it it was just preportioned meat that they slapped on the bread then added some lettuce tomato cheese and dressing  I would say this place is about on par with Speedway the gas station subs  But Speedways subs are 4 for 12 so Ill pick speedway for price  If you want really good subs try Penn Station East Coast Subs Firehouse Subs or Dibellas Subs  Theyre all a lot better than this place  Even Subway is better and its cheaperFast Very fast Line was outside the door I started to kind of panic but it went down very quickly  We were at the counter ordering in under 10 minutes This company is opening up new locations everyday I can see why Always a good experience at Jimmy JohnsThis is the first time I stopped in to eat here The service is very fast and the sandwiches are great The sandwiches are made to order and are worth the costThis is my favorite Jimmy Johns in Pittsburgh I work nearby so its easy to stop here and grab a quick lunch Though the lines are enormous at lunch time during the week the lines do move quickly There is ample space inside as there is a lower level as wellThe veggie club is my absolute favorite Im sad that they have done away with the alfalfa sprouts but at least the avocado spread is delicious and adds more to the sandwich than just an assortment of raw veggies I enjoy getting the wheat bread instead of the usual roll which is also delicious The wheat bread is dense and has a delicious crunch to it because it is so stuffed with grainsCome early during the week for lunch or else after 1:30 This will ensure that you get a seat if youd like to sit down rather than carry lunch back to the office"

    "review":"I first heard of this place through their mailer ad  Their menu is very large pasta to gyros to salads not to mention their actual pizzas which I think hurts them a bit  I read a review on a different site that gave them a low rating based on their soups but I dont think this should be representative of their pizza  Come on people  If youre going to order out to a pizza place get the freakin pizza  Which brings me to my next point: their pizza is absolutely delicious  The best part is their fantastic crust which is just the right amount of chewiness and crispiness and taste  Some people prefer a really thick or thin crust so I should mention that theirs is a little bit on the thick side but its always cooked perfectly no doughiness  Ive tried their specialty Seafood Pizza as well as their Artichoke Pizza and both were loaded with toppings and tasted sooooo good  I also have tasted their plain cheese pizza which was tasty also  Their prices are incredibly reasonable especially for the specialty pizzas and keep in mind that their medium pizza is like a large at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns  I have had the pizza delivered as well as chosen to pick it up  They might be a little slow when delivering because they offer to deliver to such a huge area so the smart thing to do might be to call in for pick up  So in closing skip all the fluff on their menu and try one of their specialty pizzas    You wont be disappointedDecent pizza baked a conveyorbelt oven Rarely have slices just whole pies and walkins arent really welcome Almost no sitting room and the atmosphere isnt something youd want to spend time in anyway Staff always seems surprised and unready when I come to pick up my orderlove the pizza here wings not so much but the pizzas are def worth tryingI am only speaking to having Little Nippers delivered I have never been in the restaurant  The wings are really good and are typically what my husband and I order  Pizza is also good although extremely greasy and with delivery they dont necessarily slice it all the way through  Also issues with a pizza showing up on which all the toppings had slid to one side  I assume it was dropped by delivery person or kitchen staffThere are SO many good reviews of this place on both Grubhub and Yelpso I decided to use my weekly caloriesplurge night on their specialty Steak Pie and Chicken Salad The salad was what I expected really nothing great at alla little bit of iceberg lettuce onion 2 grape tomatoes chicken and a few steak fries essentially what you would expect ordering a salad from a pizza place Think of this one Family Guy episode haha But the pizza was equally unappetizing Not only was is lukewarm upon arrival but the toppings werent properly cooked It was a bunch of raw green peppers mushrooms and some other barelycooked veggies with very little steak on top of thin undercooked dough I am genuinely disappointed right now It looked really good when I opened it but I knew after the first bite it was a bust Perhaps this was just a bad day for them but they wont be getting any business from me ever againthere are too many other great pizza places in Pittsburgh to waste my money on one that can produce such an underwhelming and frankly offputting productOrdered the mediterranean calzone its too oilygreasy and the crust is soft Nice service though"

    "review":"Ordered a pizza for the super bowl after recieving a letter in the mail   Order arrived on time  The Pizza was very good   Along with the Pizza we ordered A steak deluxe Italian hoagie and some wings  The Hoagies were some of the best that Ive ever had   Especially the deluxe Italian  Wings weere very good also  We got the Buffalo garlic parmesam and dry rub   A bit pricey why we only gave 4 stars  but we will definatly be ordering againMediocre hoagies Couldnt pay me to eat the pizza We order because we live literally within walking distance of the place so its convenient Today we were tired from work and ordered 2 hoagiesit look FIFTY minutes and both hoagies were coldi can see your store from my house yet your delivery boy callaled to tell me hes coming from dormont and cant remember our address Never ever againWe received a letter in the mail that stated we should come give their pizza a try So I took them up on the offer it seemed like a little man trying to compete with big business We received a large pizza a salad breadstix and a 2 L for 1600 Now I know why it was so cheapWhen you walked into this location there was a woman who was cooking and who was the cashier who had no teeth or manners she took her flour covered hands and used my credit card then went back to making pizzasWe received the food took it back to our place and it tasted awful The sauce cheese and dough had no flavors what so ever The pizza was bland The cheese was most likely a single blend that just honestly tasted like plastic The breadstix included a garlic butter and a red sauce however they also lacked flavor which in turn made you want to douse them in sauce which was also flavorlessThe salad was a really good salad which included a bunch of veggies however only included one packet of dressingHey at least the 2L was goodI will probably not ever go back unless I was shown that something had been done to make the pizza taste better maybe add some herbs and a blend of moz and brick cheeseNobbys pizza was great I really like their pizza and the staff was so friendly Also the pizza was bigI dont generally expect much when I order delivery from a restaurant mostly Im just hoping for edible food Nobbys hits it out of the park with their pizza and their bread sticks as well The bread sticks were light and slightly spongey incredible texture the included marinara was sweet with enough tanginess from tomatoes to make the sweetness light a pleasant rather than overpowering The pizza I got traditional pepperoni was delicious the crust looked thinner than I typically like on a pizza there was a thicker crust option but I wanted to try the standard first but I was pleasantly surprised with the crust and I would definitely order it standard again the sauce was nicely sweet and tangy and the crust around the end wasnt hard as a rock like Im used to with most pizza orders cheese was melted perfect also Lastly the delivery driver was really polite and professional even though my house is a pain to find so that was awesome Overall I give the meal in particular a 55 as well as Nobbys a 55 First impressions are everything for me when it comes to food and Nobbys really knocked it out of the park for me so I definitely look forward to ordering again and trying something else on their menuIm from New York so of course Im picky about the pizza I eat I have high standards Nobbys makes some of the best pizzas Ive had in Pittsburgh They deliver which is nice and they usually have some kind of coupon deal going on There was only one time something went wrong with the delivery but they fixed it lightening fast This is my preferred pizza place in Pittsburgh"

    "review":"It is an average Italian restaurant The view of Pittsburgh is nice but that is all this place is Food and decor is not exciting the service is not special I was here with a large group and everybodys impression was the same 3 star food in a 3 star establishment They have a full barThe staff was very cordial the food was delicious and of course the view was amazing If you want a quaint casual fine dining experience this is the place to be Family owned and very intimate The beef wellington and chicken Rockefeller was very goodI went here for a special occasion with a date  The reviews had me a bit skeptical not to mention the notveryfriendlyguyonthephone through whom I made the reservation  But Im happy to say we not only loved the view the lady who served our table was particularly friendly and the food was quite good though a bit low quality for the price  The one complaint I have is that our table was frustratingly close to a fairly loud family but this kind of tight seating certainly isnt unique to this establishment  All in all not the best meal Ive ever had but Id call it a solid spot for a romantic or special occasionWe didnt have food We just had a drink there before dinner Prices are reasonable for such a wonderful view Definitely recommendThe views cant be beat the food was Amazing  the triple Chocolate cake best chocolate cake Ive ever had Service was prompt zero complaintsAmazing views and food The service was great on a busy Saturday evening I had the Chicken Rockefeller and my date had the Chicken Parmesan Delish The atmosphere is lovely and intimate Id highly recommend this We drove over from Cleveland Totally worth the trip"

    "review":"Ah Decent sheesha in Pittsburgh Finally The service is amazing too Unlike the other hookah places it is spacious and the ambiance is great too You know where to find me when I am lostSeems to be a popular hookah lounge Many places to sit along with plenty of staff to keep your hookah fresh Seems to be a very chill environment with hipster music that isnt too loud Definitely a cool place to smoke if you are up for itIve read a lot of notsogreat reviews on here and Im kind of surprised because I had a really good time here If I had to complain about anything its that I didnt find out that their card readers were down and I had to get cash out of a charge ATM Other than that though I really enjoyed my experience here The atmosphere was relaxing but it also made me feel like I was somewhere fun at the same time I  liked the hookah I smoked and the guy who was our server was really nice and quick to get us anything we needed I was able to get my hookah in a relatively short amount of time and I stayed for quite a while too Check it out if you get the chance Just make sure to get there relatively early so you can find parkingWorst hookah bar ever Hookah is subpar No music 5 byob which is not displayed on the front door Colorful chairs that look nice but are hard plastic that are uncomfortable Only good thing is that the waiter cant remember her name is very nice So yelps folks if ur looking for hookah look elsewhere because this isnt it 1  star for SphinxAfter my prior review I went to purchase a new Khalil Mamoon hookah from the Sphinx The entire experience left me feeling insulted and extremely frustrated If anyone knows anything about hookah towers its that Khalils are easily the best on the market With quality however comes a price Your average 34 foot KM goes for anything from 100200 depending on customization size etc I was lead to the front of the room where they had an open display of all their hookahs that I was told were brand new and unused I noticed a few were clearly not brand new and were obviously owned by prior hookah smokers I searched until I found a gold and black inlay Khalil with a grand design to it It looked to be spotless I was willing to shell out the 125 as proper treatmentcare of a Khalil will allow you to use it for literally your entire life After the girl waiting on me took it off the shelf she said they didnt have a box for it After 20 minutes of waiting while my girlfriend was growing impatient outside she returned with what was essentially a few pieces of long cardboard duct taped together Clearly they didnt have the original box I was told with my purchase comes a free shisha bowl and 100 grams of their own house mix The bowl itself was way too small cracked then a hack job of a repair was done to it and ultimately useless for this hookah On the back of the kitchen is a whiteboard where management encourages employees to sell shisha that isnt selling too well The two on the list AppleCinnamon What mix did I get with my hookah 100 grams of clearly stale applecinnamon Wonderful I took my hookah to another hookah bar in South Side where I smoke with friends and then the st really hit the fan The weld of the tip of the hookah where the bowl goes clearly broke off at some point and was poorly welded back on ruining the fine and ornate design where the ash tray would lay The ash tray itself was not Khalil but some dented piece of sheet metal made by a Neanderthal The tower itself had no valve and ball where you can blow out smoke because it was completely snapped off and missing The tower was also NOT the right size for the base and would not properly fit into it meaning it wobbled around which is a huge strike for the fact that the coals could easily be knocked off The base itself is where I was most infuriated The beautiful ornate designs that Khalil is known for was clearly scratched off at some point and repainted by someone with mere wall paint I rubbed it all off with a DRY paper towel and now theres nothing on it Plain as can be Ive never felt so cheated and insulted that a place would try something as snakeish as this The owner gave me the typical no returns policy was incredibly rude and wouldnt even see my hookah for me to explain my case For my final recommendation Head to Sahara Hookah 1205 East Carson Street The Sphinx is TRASHI gave two stars just because the atmosphere was nice and the chairs were cool because they lit up Anyways I am extremely appalled at what kind of business sucks you dry for your money like that Scammed into VIP for 2 per person because the service is better yet we waited 45 mins to get our hookah Not to mention they did not touch the coals once after the initial setting of them Barely saw the guy working but when I did he made sure to try to nonchalantly add something to my bill Did not mention anything would be extra just asked if you would LIKE to add this this this this and that As casual as he could into conversation not to mention bottled water was 250you must buy drinks with your hookah not sure what kind of rule that is but hey whatever gets your money All drinks averaging from about 4506 each Terrible service and terrible rip off Recommend going to south side opposed to this cheap place"

    "review":"I had a hot dog and a coke for 5 bucks There arent too many places down town where you can get lunch for 5 I didnt have any complaints about the food and the place was clean Service was fast and friendlyThe food is good enough Split a 2 natural casing hotdog combo and cheese fries HOWEVER this place is cash only and Im pretty sure the onsite ATM has a skimmer Although they were good the hot dogs are definitely NOT worth the hassle of the fraud claim you will have to file with your bank if you use their ATMWould give 3 stars for the foodservice but since I just spent the whole morning dealing with the multiple fraudulent charges on my account I wasnt feeling too generousI am not a big fan of hot dogs but as I was walking past one day I saw a sign for 4 chili on Wednesdays I stopped in and got the chili and have been a regular visitor every Wednesday since The man who works there who I believe is the owner is extremely nice and even remembers me I would definitely recommend the chiliProbably some of the nicest people youll ever meet making fast tasty food 14 pound sausage with chili and cheese hit the spotThis is exactly what you would expect from a hot dog shop  There are a few different types of dogs here some popular condiments and a soda fountain    All in all the dogs are better than Sheetz but there are a few other places downtown that do hot dogs better   If you are nearby it is worth popping in and grabbing a hot dog to eat standing at the counter but I wouldnt go out of my way for a tripI love a good hot dog and this is a good hot dog place  The people working were incredibly nice and helpful people  The inside as others have said just has a standing bar against a wall and thats it  The hot dogs were full and plump and had good flavor  They have plenty of options for toppings on the dogs  I also got fries and a malt  The malt was very good and the fries were just your standard average fries  All in all if you like hot dogs you should try this hot dog joint"

    "review":"Love the lunch thalis here Nice and spicy with a solid selection of south indian fare Also good for lunch on the weekends though all they typically have is the buffet and no menu items I enjoy their dosas and kormas When the indian food craving hits youthis is the place though not for north indian dishes Dont plan any meetings right after lunch because the savory aromas stick with you and you sort of smell like the place for a bit Its kid friendly too they dont have crayons or anything but you dont get any dirty looks eitherI love the intricate spices and heat of the food Most restaurants here dumb down for the Pittsburgh palateThe womens bathroom doesnt lock out of towels and the restaurant floor looks to be never cleaned Buffet was sloppy looking and dark entry and dark interior only looks like they are hiding dirtI have enjoyed the foodThere are too many family types with children eating here Children here tend to be fussy and annoying  Parents do not monitor their spawnthey are unruly and noisyThis place keeps me yearning for moreAfter hearing my friends talk about this place and after sampling their lunch specials at the local Indian grocery store Manpasand I decided to give this place a try I have been here for a sit down dinner as well as ordered food to goLet me start by saying that the food is on the spicier side so order a level down than what you usually do For our sit down meal we ordered Chicken Sangrilla a new dish for me This was tasty but SPICY we ordered a 7 but could have done well with a 6 I could not really pinpoint all the herbs an spices in this however for a dish I never tried before I found myself cleaning the plate We also got the Chicken 65 which is fried marinated chicken strips small pieces While great in flavor this dish did not taste as I expected it to be an overdose of spices that numbed my mouth The two appetizers were however sufficient enough for our table of 4 BTW they do serve Papad once you place your order so you can munch on something till your appetizers arrive and they also have a full barWe then proceeded to get a plate of the Malai Kabab and Boti Kabab Both of these were delicious  chicken was tender lamb was perfectly cooked and both the meats were marinated well In my opinion the size of the kababs were small For entrees we ordered Kadai Chicken Saag Paneer and Dal Fry I am usually very picky about eating spinach at Indian restaurants but did not have any aftereffects so I give the spinach here an allclear Since all the entrees came with rice we supplemented our food with only two Garlic Naans and by the end of the night we were stuffed haha maybe because of the sheer amount of food we ordered I cannot remember if we ate any dessertOur server was attentive food prices were in line for a 3 star Indian restaurant and the food was good not overly oily or greasy During my second experience takeout I ordered a Garlic Naan Sheekh Kabab and Tandoori Chicken I felt like I was eating a health conscious chicken as the pieces were not very meaty However my major let down was the Sheekh Kabab  the meat felt dry though still perfectly marinatedSumming both my experiences I would happily give it a 35 stars but to err on the side of caution a 3 for Yelp will be good for nowI have tried every indian buffet in Pittsburgh and Tamarind is the BEST The food is fresh and hot the restaurant is clean and well lit The food in the buffet is spicier and there is so much more to choose from as apposed to other buffets They included different types of meat not just chicken but also goat which was my favorite dish None of the dishes were watered down nothing looked old they never ran out of naan bread The buffet included mango lassi that was refreshing and just a wonderful I was in heaven I am definitely going back soon So far Tamarind Savoring India is my favorite place to goI called them at 11:00am on a Thursday and asked if I could order lunch for 10 to go which is not something they normally do  The waiter checked with the chef and they were able to accommodate me and it was ready by noon  I left a huge tip and was so thankful that they were able to help me out  I ordered saag paneer chicken tikka masala naan and rice  The people who ate the food said it was the best Indian they have had in the city  I will defiantly be backThe two star is for the extensive buffet menu Other than that its a one star Absolutely tasteless Im from Dallas TX and I have been enough Indian restaurants in Texas New York NJ and many places This probably ranks at the lower end Rubbery naan the egg plant curry was absolutely the worst Sambar was never refilled and service was below expected the only thing for service at a buffet is taking the plates out and serving water that too they failed My suggestion: have some other cuisine or at least try a different one"

    "review":"Amazing Every bite is just so very good Be prepared to spend some money  portions are astoundingly tiny in my experience the pasta dishes give you slightly more mass for your dollar but totally worth itA lovely birthday dinner we had tonight We came in around 6 and the place was half full So no wait and we picked a nice table with couch We brought our 2yr old kid and found out the restaurant is not really interested in kids No high chair and kids menu Which for us is totally not a big deal The music was loud so if she was having difficult time not all guests would be bothered  Our waiter i think his name was Tony was really nice Very clear and on point We started with some breads and spreads lovely Also the goatcheese spread was really delicious After that lamb meat balls and peach with ricotta in flatbread Both dishes very fresh with a lot of flavor Another course with veal tagliatelle and buckwheat tart I didnt try the tagliatelle and my husband was actually not hungry anymore Our kid loved it The tart was so so some pieces of fennel where very sour Overall a great experience and Im happy that we went hereThe ambiance is nice  although a bit dark  and as a side note the background music was awful I feel like Spork is trying a little too hard to be cool but Ill forgive them for the cocktails and food Im also a huge fan of the fact that Spork is No Wait appfriendly  we walked right in were greeted by name and seated immediatelyWe started with cocktails I had the herbal vodka watercress mint st germain which was one of the best drinks Ive ever had anywhere and my husband had the daisy honeydew mezcal smoked chiles which he said was very different from what his normal choice of an IPA but appropriate for the feast we hadWe started with the charcuterie board which rivaled my favorite in town at the Allegheny Wine Mixer We followed with some gnosh:Goat cheese balsamiceggplant biscotti  Warm lovely and served on the most perfectly grilled bread if I could have bought a jar to take home I would haveArugula pancetta soft egg tomato  I wanted to love this salad but just didnt The arugula was missing with spinach in its place and the pancetta was hard to findWe then had a few items from the vario section:Grilled lamb sausage brie mustard flatbread  The ingredients each on their own were very yummy but the dish fell flat on composition it was quite messy almost thrown togetherPork cheeks cider jus tempura apple polenta  By far my favorite dish of the night due to the meaty tart creamy little bit of everything quality of the flavorsWe finished with some pasta: Pasta rags mint ricotta peas duck soppressata  I could have eaten this twice over for sure as the pasta was delicate the mintricottapeas combo a palette pleaser and the duck soppressata perfectly cookedWe obviously had a huge meal but I dont feel like it was overly expensive for the quality and quantity of what we ordered The only downside to this specific experience was that we had awful excruciatingly slow service which can ruin even the best tapas meal Again Ill forgive the service for the food I think Spork is still having growing pains as they are relatively new to the Pittsburgh food scene  so Id like to go back again and see if Im still willing to forgive the shortcomings Id also like to sit at the bar so I can watch the kitchenCame here for our anniversary Started with a fine cocktail well designed gin with fresh dehydrated ginger called a Muddle a great open First it should be noted that a very drunk panhandler entered the restaurant and led the house in a chant of Lets Go Pens before being showed to the door It made me well aware of the economic divide that is part of the Penn Avenue neighborhood transition We waited for 20 minutes at the bar where people graciously made room for us and we were perfectly seated in a great window table for dinner I was already in a good place having discovered a great drink and was eager for an amazing meal Ordering at Spork is participatory by checking a paper menu with a pencil it was a fun way to order For the record sporks are on the table with forks knifes and spoons We put ourselves in the hands of the waitstaff and ordered what they recommended with the exception of two of our calls: Ceviche and an order of lentil meatballs We loved the recommended goat cheese in a jar and the grilled romaine salad to start Our first OK dish arrived in the form of the lentil meatballs They were dry luke warm fried and edible but not great Next we had the recommended Chestnut Gnocchithese were better than the meatballs but not worth the big fuss that the staff made Unfortunately  although we had not been served all we ordered we were approach about desserts and only when we inquired about our missing dish did it arriveThe final dish of our meal was a coffee crusted steak which was also highly recommended by the wait staff This dish was a bright spot of our dinner and ended everything on a super high note Although the staff was nice I did not feel like they cared about making our evening special they did write on the check Happy Anniversary but nothing more  a simple something would have been appropriate  the real slight came as the chef who was working the tables didnt even check in on our table Over all the cocktail was a plus the food is very good and the ambiance is nice The food was creatively prepared and carefully presented right down to the the edible chive blossom  I am looking forward to coming back and trying other dishes I have a strange positive feeling that our next meal will be better than our first My expectations were just too high the service was not dead on for our special night and we picked a couple of near misses to offset three spectacular home runsThis is a lovely addition to the Pittsburgh scene The ambience is very Lower East Side circa 2010 which at least for me was a great timeplace to get a bite Its cozy and well designed Now we went on a Monday night near closing time so it wasnt particularly crowded but I remember thinking wow this place has wonderful sound design in that the ceilings were relatively high and the space quite open and yet I could hear my dinner companions without them having to raise their voices Seems like a silly observation but many times I have to pop in an ear plug to reduce the surrounding noise at restaurants Anyway even though we arrived later the staff was wonderful Many times you can see the look of horroranguishhate in their eyes when you come towards the end of the shift and risk staying slightly after hours I get it Ive done it but everyone who helped us was so nice I ended up going with some sort of gin drink and loved it my companions went with wine and equally enjoyed their selections We then ordered a sampling of land and sea Some things were amazing and some were fine Having read yelp reviews before arriving I noticed a pattern of people recommending the breads and spreads Trust the hype and do it Theyre awesome The bolognese on the other hand did not blow my socks off One of my fellow diners was in love with it but Im Italian and found it to be no better than the homemade pasta and sauce my gram makes every weekend The mussels tasted extremely fresh which is not the norm for the Pittsburghseafood pairing so I very much appreciated it Overall I was very satisfied and excited to return again Note: as so many other people have before I will point out that the portions are quite small and require quite the sampling for you and your party to be completely full That can get pricey in this case Plan accordingly and ask your server for hisher recommendations the staff seems very knowledgable and happy to assist Its not standard Pittsburgh fair which makes it a lovely treat so make sure you are prepared to enjoy itFood was really good however the wait for each plate was extremely long About a 4050 minute wait for the food upon seating"

    "review":"This is THE LOUDEST restaurantbar I have ever been in We were seated at a 2person booth leaning across the table and I still had to yell in my loudest voice to be heard Albeit it was a Saturday night halfoff food and after the first Pitt football game of the season but still This is definitely not the place to go if you want to have any sort of intelligible conversation However if you want a place where you can belt out Eddie Money songs at the top of your voice Hemingways is the place to be PS Food was soso but for half off its hard to complainGreat place to go before Pitt basketball game  Great bar food and pricesPlace is decent if youre looking to grab some quick food on Pitt game day They have good sandwiches and wraps and is affordableI wouldnt recommend this place if youre looking for a quiet clean atmosphere It does have a frat basement smell to it but that should come as no surpriseMy roommate and I were trying to catch a late lunch and it just came to me that I had never been to the quintessential college bar on campus We split an entree that was half off and called it a meal because we both werent that hungry We got the drunken chicken and for bar food it was pretty good The chicken was tender but the sweet potato fries that it was served on was mushy and not appetizing The vegetables were the kind that you get from the freezer aisle in Giant Eagle and you microwave on those sad lonely nights that you eat over your kitchen sink Also heads up: they charge for water during half offStopped here around 10 on a Saturday night and the crowd was just rolling in The atmosphere is definitely college based but wasnt over the top rowdy The service was excellent and the food was exactly as expected if not a little better I was really blown away when I was told the majority of food was half off not sure about the details but it was certain times and days we had a party of 3 who all got burgers as well as spinach artichoke dip and the bill was barely over 20 This place rocks and I will definitely go back if Im ever looking for a quick cheap meal that is above average for a dive barGood beer selection and friendly wait staff We were the first ones here before going on to a party Apparently I blinked because the place was suddenly packed and loud We had a couple beers at the O next door waiting for this place to open  They should open a little earlier on the weekend"

    "review":"I hate vegetables and am super sensitive to spices That being said I love eating at Istanbul Grille The owner serves the food and if its your first time youd better come hungry He will give you everything that you dont have an allergy to and doesnt take no for an answer Think a friendly Soup Nazi Usually only cash but you can always pay your next time A Pittsburgh gemI had a lamb wrap and baba ganoush and it came with some salad Portions are a good size and everything was seasoned well and tasty except the salad 1 This is a prepped meal place so everything is laid out in front of you to choose from For 8 I had a wonderful lunchSimply put this is the best lunch spot in Pittsburgh You could eat here every day and not get sick of the food Istanbul Grille uses the freshest ingredients and everything is made from scratchAside from the impeccable quality of the food the staff is extremely friendly and helpful especially if it is your first time The owner Josh is incredibly generous and will make sure that you want to come back again and againThey are cash only but there are PNC ATMs upstairs so hit them before you go down the escalatorStopped in for lunch today after reading so many good reviews I was not disappointed I really had no idea what to get so I ordered the Meal 2 option which was salad bulgerrice and choice of three vegetable I got the bulger with eggplant spinach and lentils It was fantastic I added hummus for an extra 1 and the flavors were all exactly what I was craving Everything looked so good I had a hard time deciding what to order I will absolutely be back to experiment with some of the other offerings Plus the servings are large so Ill be able to stretch it into two lunchesa total winwinIve wanted to try the Istanbul grill for quite some time since it had so many great reviews  Unfortunately  I was duped by the common misperception by Pittsburghers that large portions means the same thing as high quality  I ordered a lamb pita to eat out on the plaza with a Jazz band playing  Atmosphere  A  They were out of salad  Seriously  You cant send someone downstairs to the indoor location to get more  At least they comped a drink fine  The pita comes overstuffed with meat  A very hearty portion fir 8  The guy serving it ia quite pleasant so I sit down and bite into it with anticipation of the flavors I read about in the reviews  Thats when it becomes a disappointment  It wasnt bad per se  Id actually eat it again if I were with people who wanted to eat there   But it wasnt actually good either  Specifically  the meat was cut way too thick  And then after I asked for light onions and light hot sauce he simply drenched it in what I assume is yogurt sauce without asking  Way to much yechIm not expecting world class cuisine at a stand in Steel Plaza but this is on par with an exceeding average gyro you can get all over the place  There are at least a dozen places in the city that are much better for this type of food  though this may be as good as it gets downtown If you want a very large portion of decent food for a reasonable price this is your restaurant   If you want above average great tasting food dont bother with this placeHands down my FAVORITE place to eat lunch downtownI go to Istanbul Grille for lunch at least twice a week and I have never had a bad meal They also give you plenty of food so it is more than worth the price"

    "review":"I love Kaya  This place just exudes a fun and friendly atmosphere and is the only place I know of where you can order Tapas in Pittsburgh  Theyre all delicious and if youve never tried alligator you can do that here tooThe food was very very good but I dropped the ranking two stars based on service  My wife 2 year old son and I visited tonight for my Birthday  While we werent ready to order immediately first visit our server seemed very friendly and relaxedready to go  But once we ordered everything took way too long  Our drink order took 510 minutes and when we placed our full order apps and entrees with a rush on sweet potato fries everything showed up around 25 minutes later our entrees came out 23 minutes after the apps  I told the server countless times to bring out a side order of sweet potato fries as my kid was melting down and she kept saying they ran out and were making more meanwhile said kiddo was pointing out all the fries every other table was receiving as everyone around us received their food  I also asked if the kitchen was in the weeds I dont want to blame the service unnecessarily and she said no and looked at me like I was crazy  Service was absolutely pitiful yes I served tables back in the day so I know bad service  Ultimately although their food was absolutely fantastic they are too dysfunctional as a kitchen and wait staff for me to risk bringing my family back there again  I truly love Casbah and Mad Mex but this restaurant just hasnt figured out how to make people comfortable  I really hate writing such a harsh review about a restaurant with such wonderful food but from a family stand point I am definitely not their target customer and that is aok I just know I wont be back for a long timeSide Note: the bar tenders are great  When the service hit rock bottom I bussed most my dishes to them asked for extra silverware drinks etc and they were very coolAs a vegetarian I was really excited about the food here I got the Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos as well as black bean dip as an appetizer  The tacos were delicious but missing a little something Put the black bean dip into them and OMG even better Really impressed and my mouths watering just thinking about it Hope to return soon :I stopped in for 2 beers as I had eaten a late lunch so this review is for that onlypros:  interesting and unique atmosphere including decor and music diverse yet not a overwhelming selection of drafts and liquorlows:  quite simply rude curt and unacceptable service from the 2 bartenders lets call them the richard cabezas to keep with the theme  Ask them a question and get a one word answer unless they were correcting me about something and that was combined with an eye rollJust didnt feel welcomed and  comfortable which is super rare for me anymore and lets just say I WILL NOT be returningGreat brunch even better happy hour and always a pleasant experience Ive probably gone here 3040 times might have a problem and its consistently great The avocado tempura tacos fish tacos salmon salad and grapefuit marg are my gotosMy coworkers and I visit Kaya for happy hour occasionally  I love the ambiance  Brick faced walls mixed with a nontacky tropical vibe  Its warm and inviting  a great place to goIve only nibbled on a couple appetizers  Conch fritters were tasty and the black bean dip was not too bad either  However their drinks I have a favoriteIve tried the Graduate which is sage liquor limoncello lemon sparkling wine  Its very fresh but a tad bit sweet  I asked my bartender his favorite and he said the Pisco Sour  Barsol Pisco lime egg white Angostura bitters  Frothy yet tart  I love it  We have a winner :If youre looking for a great happy hour venue try Kaya and have a Pisco Sour  Ill be there too so say hello"

    "review":"In short bartender steph selectively provides very terrible customer service to some customers but the managers are understanding if you have an issue Heres why I go to this bar very infrequently and generally have an okay experience but the above rating is due to very terrible customer service we received from two of the bartenders Steph specifically on the same night Started with ordering a shandy The drink tasted nothing like shandy but my friend drank it anyway just to not cause any trouble only to find out later from another employee steph that they actually dont have shandys Rather than simply saying they dont have the it they proceeded to give us something that tastes like it without even letting us know Bartenders response when I confronted him was its the closest we got while rolling his eyes Since when is this acceptableLong story short I calmly requested a refund for that drink since they clearly knowingly gave us the wrong drink In return I get zero apologies an angry bartender steph starting to scream asking me if I wanted a shot and telling me to bring the drink back if I wanted a refund I tried to deescalate her incivility and she immediately started to not acknowledge that I was even there or that there was an issue At this point I asked her name which she lied about and told me was samantha I spoke to the manager who seemed understanding of the ridiculousness of the situation and terrible customer service provided by his employees and refunded my drinks Otherwise the atmosphere is just ok Lots of smoking etc I probably will not be going back for a whileNice deck but not all that cheap  Also Id prefer a dj to the music videos but the screens are needed for tv showmovie nights and football season I understand  This used to be New York New York so its nice to see that the establishment is still around and its nice to run in to some familiar faces from Pegasus True etc  I dont know if its the same owners or notI dont really care  The food is good and Ive met some fun people there :Beautiful deck great bartenders fun atmosphere  loved itI love the patio here Always a nice crowd good music and friendly Pittsburgh locals hanging out Its my favorite of the gay bars in the area and they often have theme nights and friendly regulars around that love to chat up a friendly California girl Make this your stop to get acquainted with the local gay scene in Pittsburgh and know that the venue is friendly for gays and non gays in any caseI went here the other night and the only positive part is that I left there not smelling like a cigarette The drinks are ENTIRELY overpriced Hello 750 Cranberry and Absolute Correction splash of Absolute The beers too were overpriced And please allow me to mention that if you are not a well dressed man male bartenders seem to overlook youIf you are looking for a gay friendly place with outdoor seating I suggest going down the block to Harris Grill for better service and cheaper drinks OH and parking in this area is awfulAwesome bar  one of my favs in the midwest I always stop by when Im passing through Pittsburgh nice mixture of soaked locals and curious travelers Great location  average drinks"

    "review":"Nice on the inside and full of comfortable couches  When my friends and I went they were out of soup so we wound up just sitting in their seats for 20mins while waiting for burgatory  I just wish they wouldve has that soupGreat location  great food Im not usually a chain fan but this one is consistently good enough to make me a regular We like to pick up croissants and bagels here all the time since its so convenient Surprisingly for a franchise the breads can be quite good No its not as exquisite as a home or boutiquebaked bread experience but its fast and almost as good Great place to have an informal meeting since there are so many booths theres even a conference room available if you have a larger party In general we use it for a bit of web surfing while grabbing a quick bite They list the calories on each order so you can know what you are orderingAllinall a good healthy value and convenient for people who might be in a rush on some daysI want to give credit to the hard working staff at this place and note that the young girls working at the front were helpful and great However the reason for this negative review is in regard to the manager on duty who was preparing the food when I ordered breakfast sandwiches First off he was rude and distracted and when I asked a simple question about the rest of my order he barked at me that sandwiches and pastries  are picked up at two different locations Without being informed by either a written sign or verbalization how the heck are customers to know Also I got my food to go and left Upon arriving at my location I discovered that one of the sandwiches was burnt to a crisp and it had paper in it melted into the cheese On what planet is it ok to wrap this up and give it to a customer to eat Unfortunately I did not take it back based on being on the road This is in my neighborhood and a place I frequent in order to work and study But there are other coffee shops with better service and professional staff I highly recommend passing this one byIf you want healthy food that tastes good in a place which does not hassle you about taking to long too eat while visiting with friends then this is the place for you  I love the black bean soupPerfect place to work on a project with a group  They have a closed off glass room to practice presentations or really lame practice runs of Steven Martin monologuesPerfect place to work on a project with a group  They have a closed off glass room to practice presentationsPitch presentations or group meetings"

    "review":"OK my Pittsburgh friends pick this place for good chinese food and I see the reviews and wonder why  But it turns out that we didnt order chinese dumplings but vegetarian dishes and lo and behold they are pretty good  Eggplant with garlic was just right  The vegetarian paradise was a huge plate and excellent  The vegetarian yellow bird was big tofu wrapped mushrooms although it was a bit too salty  The ma po tofu was silken tofu and nicely hot  The hot and sour soup was neither hot or sour enough and needed green onions  Overall we thought the food was goodGreat for vegetarians and sushi lovers We really enjoy this place every time we go to Pittsburgh and we have both of those in our family They have something on the menu for everyone including my picky son We recently discovered the salt and pepper green beans absolutely love the vegetable dumplings Their vegetarian entrees are great too I even enjoyed the Szechuan shrimp The waitstaff is always friendly and doesnt mind that they sometimes have to accommodate our large groups and even joke around when the kids order the Sprint typo for Sprite off of the menuI am really picky and I live this place The staff are friendly and the food is good and they deliverWent here for dinner with my family excited to try many different dumplings didnt look at the menu online first Sat looked at the menu kinda wondered to go elsewhere but stayed instead Just three type of dumplings only three and they were green dont know if that is authentic but definitely not what Im used to Ordered the veg dumplings chicken lomein and chicken hot pot all of these dishes were terrible terrible in the sense no taste no flavour below mediocre Chinese food My two year old could probably do a better job cooking flavourful Chinese fare service was ok but not attentive we caught her eating in the back not doing her job My opinion just skip this place much better Chinese food in sq hillI dont know how they do it but this place has some of the fastest delivery times  Even living in greenfield it would still get there in 30 Love their vegetarian options and Im not even a vegetarian anymore ha  Crab rangoons are the best ever and the fake orange beef is amazingIve been to the New Dumpling House several times in the past and recently went with a friend on a Sunday early evening The restaurant was completely empty other than those working there and one guy who came in to pick up takeout as we were on our way out  The atmosphere in the restaurant is underwhelming and actually makes the overall experience a bit unappetizing as does the fact that there are bowls of crispy wonton strips and uncovered containers of duck sauce and hot mustard out on every every table which made me question how fresh and sanitary that is  My friend ordered green beans with brown sauce which was tasty but she ordered it medium spicy and it had no kick to it whatsoever  I ordered vegetable pad thai but asked if I could also add tofu and the server said yes  I also ordered it medium spicy  My dish was bland and the noodles were undercooked  The only vegetables in it were some shredded carrots and a small handful of what appeared to be canned mushrooms which I picked out  Overall the experience was just okay  I would return if I was in the neighborhood and someone suggested it but will not make a special trip to eat there again  My rating is actually more like 25 stars but Im feeling generous"

    "review":"By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in theWorld You can pretty much rest assured that after your long wait in the drive thru your order will most definitely be wrong  Calls to the owner go ignored Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills  They have all gone down hill in quality service and cleanliness  The owner has to be the problemHit or miss Was there today and everything was good They even checked what happy meal toys they had for my daughter Went a few tines before and sometimes it was decent sometimes they had order wrong When order was wrong they fixed it quickly however and most of the staff is helpful Will go here rather than waterfront location anyday Also very nice sitting areaWorst McDonalds ever Waited 16 min in drive thru finally drove through without even ordering HorrificA group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive We where the only normal people in this place The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it Must I say more bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for youYou know its bad when a McDonalds gets a 1 star reviewI mean seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonalds The whole point of going to McDonalds is indulging in some notgoodforyou food on the go in your busy life In my case I just wanted a small mealsnack that wouldnt cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would I hadnt even eaten at a McDonalds in about eight years or so And I quickly remembered whyForget the fact that McDonalds food isnt great We all know its not great The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food For starters I quickly discovered that the drivethru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth You certainly wont be getting any fast food here Then once I FINALLY placed my order and finally got to the window to pay because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders a young woman took my card swiped itand didnt say another word I waited thinking she was printing a receipt  nope Eventually  after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two  she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food Whatever I figured forget the receipt by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldnt print my receipt anyway On to the next window where I was given my food and drinkand I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason layered my Big Mac as such: bread bread patty patty bread seriously how does one even mess that up I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty goodbut they were not worth the wait or troubleI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place Completely Just keep driving Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money and the people here are so slow that youll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it"

    "review":"I really cant speak highly enough of this place and to know its in North Oakland is even greater The ambiance here is remarkable trendy yet laid back Its classy without being snotty The best part I can bring my fiance here just to grab a night cap Its a little more expensive than the Oakland dives yes but  I guarantee that you will not find a better Manhattan in Oakland And the happy hours Youve gotta check them outI have been to Butterjoint twice now and both times were above average I visited last evening to catch up with a friend and grab burgers and they were cooked to perfection We both got the same thing: burger with caramelized onions bacon and cheese I indulged in an Italian Greyhound cocktail  light and refreshing You cannot go wrong with this place for a casual yet trendy atmosphere with high quality food and drinksHands down the best burger Ive ever had in the burgh Hubby said longhorn has better burger but Im skeptical Even the bread was flavorful with the juice from the meat They sell out like crazy and we were lucky to get the last piece Ive read positive reviews so the expectations already there but when I tasted it I knew all the raving about that burger is true Other items on the menu were ok but next time I would just get the burger and skip thoseThis place is tiny so seating is difficult to say the least For that and the long wait I deducted a star Thats where my disappointment ends We were in town for a few days and I was craving a good burger something awful so what do I do I pull up my trusty Yelp app My hubby makes fun of me for my dependence on Yelp but he was thanking me yesterday The menu is very small mostly consisting of burgers and pierogi I ordered the burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and my hubby got the same First I tried the fries which I had with the aioli How awesome They were flavorful and fresh and everything that tries should be Impressed and hopeful I moved on to the burger Holy Burgervana Batman That burger was good The patty was clearly freshly ground onsite the meatfat ratio was perfect And the flavoroh the flavor It was wellseasoned but not overly so as to take away from the flavor of the beef itself While eating a good meal I hum When eating a really good meal I tend to rock from side to side I did both last nightI had the fancy burger with fries a Ward 8 to drink and some figpanna cotta contraption It was all super delicious and the bartender was very friendlyI would say that this place is sophisticated without being stuffy or pretentiousExcellent food atmosphere and service  We went on a nonprofit fundraising night which they hold the first Tuesday of every month and was created by the staff  The place was packed wall to wall It was good to see people getting out to enjoy some great food and support their communities The servers donated all of their cash tips to a designated nonprofit in the area Amizade was the nonprofit selection last night Amizade helps connect people throughout the world with community projects to enhance education health fair trade and other services Overall if you enjoy a fine craft beer selection with a menu infused with fresh options daily then Butterjoint is a great spot to try"

    "review":"I went here during a recent trip to Pittsburgh to watch a fight Its a restaurant and sports bar that also serves as a club on weekends Spacious dining room and large flat screen TVs everywhere I heard they have a great brunch Steelers players were there the night I went so I could tell this is the cities hot spotAs we walk in Savoy for Sunday brunch Im immediately struck by the atmosphere and decor Did I some how just jump through space and time into a swanky Vegas night club The girls agreed this place was unusual Silly us we forgot to make reservations No worries as the restaurant was almost empty more people filed in as we were eating A few minutes after we were seated our waitress came over to take our drink order We casually eyed up the buffet in the back of the room and asked our server what was on it Fat kids paradise they should have called it Bacon eggs potatoes ribs pepper steak mac and cheese lasagna french toast casserole grits dessert and a salad if you were looking for something green Yep Who could pass up that spread I eagerly dug in and tried just about all of it Our server also brought over their homemade biscuits and cornbread muffins Delic My favorite part of the buffet was the buffalo mac and cheese Creamy smooth and a hint of spice All in all a great ladies brunch My only criticism is that our server took an extremely long time to bring our drinks or at least it felt that way as we all tried not to stare at the buffet She said that the coffee was brewed fresh but then mentioned that she would be out with the decaf when my friend ordered regular However service was very good despite that small set backWe went with very dear friends last night and found Savoy to be fabulous We dine out quite often but it was our first time here The atmosphere is very chic intimate and unique I ordered the butternut squash chocolate raviolis with lobster claw cream sauce and my husband had the veal meatloaf They were outstanding Desserts were perfection as well The chef came out to make sure we were satisfied with everything and treated us like old friends Everyone seemed to take pride in their jobs I would recommend Savoy to anyone for an incredible dining experience  A real asset to the Burgh dining experience    Joel and Sue FryeVery impressed I had the opportunity to make reservations for about 30 people for my sisters 30th birthday party  Let me say from hosts to waiterswaitresses everything was excellent and in order  The atmosphere was wonderful the staff was very sweet and helpful and made out celebration intimate  Special shout out to Gary whom coordinated everything with me  He was down to earth welcoming and very on point  The food was great Although I understand when it comes to exquisite dining that plates at each table comes all out at once however the host table of 10 people waited a while  When the food came out some entres were cold  The only thing I would suggest to the restaurant is bring food out hot  We like hot : The turkey lasagna was delicious but lukewarmOther than that WONDERFUL TIME I would go backIncredible food and spectacular serviceAs someone who frequents some of the best restaurants Pittsburgh has to offer including: Sonoma Grille The Grand Concourse The Hyeholde Il Pizzaiolo Eleven Ruth Chris Steakhouse and Gaucho Parilla Argentina to name a few I can say that my experience at Savoy was by far one of the bestFrom the moment we arrived for my birthday celebration it was clear there were good things in store The restaurants chic vibe transported me from Pittsburgh to the food scenes of New York and Chicagos finest loungesFor an appetizer my boyfriend and I shared the award winning Savoy Satays chicken skewers with peanut sauce The sauce was incredibly flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection For the main course I enjoyed the stuffed salmon The salmon melted in my mouth and the stuffing crabmeat and shrimp complimented the fish beautifully The sides of sauted spinach and Yukon whipped potatoes added that comfort food touch that is signature to Savoy What I tried of my boyfriends NY strip steak was everything a steak should be flavorful and simple We finished off the evening with the Inside Out Tart a brown butter pear and blueberry filling with a thyme caramel and brown butter dust topped off with a vanilla thyme milkshake Our server was kind enough to bring two small milkshakes since we opted to share dessert which was divine The service here is wonderful and extremely personal My water glass was never empty and I never felt rushed to put in my order Our server made insightful recommendations and was very honest about his opinions The staff was also very accommodating when we asked if they could contact a cab company to pick us upThe experience that took this night out to the next level was when the head chef came out after the meal to ensure we had enjoyed the experience and our dinner he even offered us a tour of the kitchen and other areas of the restaurant including the private VIP lounge Overall a wonderful highclass experience I will certainly be returning in the futureGreat service amazing food and nice atmosphere  Love the white leather furniture and the decor   Waiter was professional and accommodating We will be back"

    "review":"So I just wrote a review on the Thai food truck that sits right beside this one on Bigelow The Indian truck is actually quite popular and people I know absolutely love the food I think that as food truck quality goes the food is good While its great that the owner who is very nice cooks the food in front of you it does tend to take a while to get your food  and this is particularly rough when the weather is not so good Since my first few visits Ive actually have their number programed into my phone so I can call ahead  which I highly recommend In regards to the food I typically get curried veggies and rice The curry is great veggies are just ok They ask how spicy you want your dish from 1 to 10 and their spiciness tends to be a little higher than typical  so adjust your desired level of spiciness accordingly And the dishes are cheap too I believe a small dish is 450 medium 500 and large 550 paired with a soda if you want for 50Overall good food that takes a bit more time than next door but worth the waitI had the Lamb Vindaloo spiced at a level of 75 on a scale of 110 I was warned that 10 was very spicy and that most Americans could not handle it In retrospect I felt the dish was not spicy enough for me  and that a 10 may have been underwhelming as well The flavor of the dish was okay It was balanced and I couldnt pick up on any of the other spices The lamb itself was a little tough I would have liked for it to have been softer and for it to have fallen apart easier There also wasnt enough sauce to cover all of the rice so I had a few bland bites of basmatiAs a final note I think the portion size and quality are fair for the priceLove love love this little Indian truck near Soldier and Sailors  Yes it looks somewhat suspect but the Allegheny County Health Department blessed it with a green sticker of approval so youre good to goYou can get a decent sized curry dish and rice or two pieces of naan if you ask for 450  Seriously cant beat that with a stick  I love the daal which changes daily and the chana saag  This truck is VERY veggie friendly I usually come here once per week more than that if they weathers nice  Definitely give it a try if youre in the areaGreat food  My goto truck for Indian food  I recommend their chicken Korma and butter chicken to anyone who makes a visit to soldiers memorialGreat food sometimes comes from notsogreatlooking places This truck is a prime example I got a large vegetarian curry at mildmedium spice The flavor was well balanced followed by a solid wave of heat at the end It definitely included enough for two meals but make sure you have cashDelicious  and cheap indian food Uncle makes amazing mutter paneer Free soda if you are a regular customer :"

    "review":"I visited Bobs on a recommendation from PA Beauty Supply where I was way too early for my class I was attending It was Sunday at noontime and the place was hopping The service was quick and friendly The coffee was hot but nothing fantastic I had the banana pecan pancakes which I warn you are massive and delicious Very fresh The prices are reasonable Its worth checking out The tables are a little close together for my liking but I managed ok All in all a nice experienceThis is my 4th trip to this diner  Food has always been good but the service isnt worth it My husband and I went on a Saturday a little after lunch There were probably 10 other people in the place and quite a few employees With the amount of employees at the time there is no reason we shouldnt have had refills or things done in a timely manner No one seemed to want to be there and it showed We wont be going back Gab and eat is right around the corner with great food and serviceWeve tried Bobs a few times wanting so much to like it Its just not good Greasy undercooked food And its dirty Dirty tables dirty chairs dirty menus YuckFour of us went to Bobs about 5:30 last night Walked in to an almost empty restaurantbad sign One person ordered a Belgian waffle after being told that breakfast was served all day The waitress returned to tell us that the waffle iron had been turned off at 2:00 Another person ordered a fish sandwich Again the waitress returned to say that no one had bothered to bread the fish that day So there was no fishI ordered a Rachelturkey Russian dressing cole slaw The sandwich was so soggy that it could have floated away I did not eat even half of itThe pickle on the side had seen better days My husband ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich The tomato slice on the sandwich was face down When it was turned over it was black and not edible The meals are not inexpensive Our bill for two sandwiches amounted to 20 plus a tip It will be a long time before we return Fortunately Carnegie patrons have some new restaurants from which to chooseIm in here all the time for lunch as its convenient to my office  The food is reliably good soups are excellent and the service never lets me down  Cup of soup and a half grilled cheese is my goto but the patty melt is also great  Its clear from watching the waitstaff all like each other and work together as a team  Highly recommendedSolid Breakfast I had an egg white omelette with mushrooms ham and Swiss: the eggs were fluffy and the cheese melted perfectly into the juicy ham and mushrooms My Husband enjoyed the Dads Double Breakfast with scrambled eggs bacon  sausage wheat toast and two Banana Pecan pancakes Again the eggs were fluffy and the pancakes were cooked perfectly and loaded with bananas and pecansBoth meals came with Homefries which were just ok: some of the potatoes werent cooked all the way through and some tasted of old greaseThe service was prompt and very friendly and the coffee was hot and fresh We will definitely go back with our children who Im sure will love it"

    "review":"In the past I have not really been much of a fan of Rons as another reviewer has said that the food was inconsistent But I have tried it 3 times in the last 34 months because a neighbor told me that they had gotten rid of a cook and replaced him These three times have been a pleasant surprise The Pizza was well put together and cooked right wings are hot and also cooked well I have had the Italian hoagy 2 times and both times the meat was plentiful and the veggies fresh I dont agree with the other reviewer that it was all that cheap but maybe the increase in cost is reflected in the better quality of the food I have tried many pizza joints on the northside and I think this is one of the best This is take out and delivery only No seatingInconsistent again The last 2 hoagies Ive gotten here is again only mediocre The meat doesnt have much flavor and the hoagie sauce tastes like a little olive oil with nothing else again very plain  The bread is the best part which is really sad  I still like their buffalo pizza better than Franks but who knows what its going to be like if quality is slipping  I guess I will have to go to the deli and pick up the stuff for a homemade hoagie when I feel like having one For 9 bucks I think I can make a pretty good hoagie for myself and familyWas going to try the buffalo pizza Tried to call about 9:15 pm Saturday night and they didnt even pick up the phone Theyer menu says that they are open til 10pm  Disappointed again No longer going to tryWe ate here often when there were on East Ohio before the road restructure We have adopted a new life style and try to eat healthier and though they offer salads I am too tempted by the unhealthy selections Tonight we dined on one of our favorites and it was just as delicious as I remembera steak wedgie Dough as fresh as always Large was enough for 2 with enough left over for tomorrow I was as satisfied as I had been in the past Thanks RonsIf you ever wanted to eat in a palace well then get back in line because they only do takeout Rons is good pizza Nothing spectacular I never expect spectacular out of my pizza just my PrimantisRons Pizza Palace is cheap If the only requirement for your meal is that it costs less than 10 Rons still wouldnt be your best optionToday I ordered an antipasta sic salad that came with wilted lettuce thinly sliced low quality deli meat rotting carrots and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese The entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came inOn multiple occasions in the past I have ordered hoagies from Rons While I have had enjoyable hoagies from Rons that is not the standard experience The hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality occasionally good frequently bad If you get a hoagie I dont recommend one with produce on it The produce in their hoagies is as bad as their saladsI wont be ordering from Rons again despite the inexpensive menu Im all for a cheap meal but only if a certain standard of quality is met With Rons you are better off considering fast food"

    "review":"Ill agree with the reviewer who said that Food for Thought has good sandwiches but Im not going to ding them for having prices that arent cheap but not unreasonable If you want dirt cheap food in a cramped questionably clean storefront on Craig you can go right next door to Pizza Prima Food for thought on the other hand has plenty of seating and is very clean and comfortable The people behind the counter were friendly and accommodating as I was fumbling through what I wanted I still prefer Smallmans when Im in Squirrel Hill but Food for Thought is my new favorite deli near Pitts campusI am really picky when it comes to eating out but I absolutely adore this place  Best corned beef sandwiches EVER  I always get the triple decker 4 without the chopped liver with a side order of latkas with apple sauce and sour cream  Delicious  However I wished that they would have kept their old latka recipe  I have been away from Pittsburgh for years now and I truly miss their foodSince this is right down the street from my apartment I mainly go here for deli meat or a quick sammich and matzo ball soup for lunch when I am in the mood Although their deli prices are a little more than Giant Eagle the quality is much better The customer service Ive had so far is excellent and everyone is very friendly If you havent tried this place I would highly recommend making a stop hereI love this placeSandwiches and soups are cooked in a homestyle cooking with heart And the taste definitely worth this price without mentioning their prices are inexpensive alreadyGreat lunch and breakfast sandwiches and they have an interesting in a good way selection of bottled and canned drinks Really clean and service is great Seems family ownedThis is a nice deli to drop by for a sandwich during lunch The Deli is located further away than many other delissandwich shops in Oakland so the Deli is not packed with college students during lunch hour rather it has a mixture of older professionals and some studentsThere is a television located in the dinein section so you can catch up on the days news"

    "review":"Excellent service and fresh sushi made to order  You are welcomed like family the moment you walk in the door  My only regret is that my lunches arent longer  I work down the street and only have enough time to pick up a roll or two due to shortened lunch period not the service but would love a leisure lunch sampling their delightful sushiSimple fresh delicious sushi  Great for takeout but eatin for some warm conversation  Stop in say Hi and enjoyThis is a great lunch spot I wish I worked closer so I could go more oftenThe place is quite small but it seems that they do a lot of their business with takeout lunch orders so we didnt have any trouble getting a table The man and woman working there were SO incredibly kind and welcoming I felt like I was being served lunch in their home I witnessed their interactions with a few people who came and went while we were there and was very pleased They seems to have a great relationship with their regulars and it is no wonder people keep coming backThey have a great special which includes 2 rolls and a soup or salad We ordered 4 rolls a soup salad and 2 drinks and it came out to just around 20 They do not have any special rolls just the basic Spicy Tuna California Shrimp Tempura Salmon etc but everything was fresh and made to order If you are in the strip and craving some sushi check it out"

    "review":"I like going here for a fairly priced sit down dinner if I happen to be in the Oakland area  My two favorite dishes there are the fish tacos and the Pittsburgh chichen salad buffalo style  The waffle fries that they use on there are amazingI had one of the burgers It was cooked very close to perfection and was very juicy It came with a side of a spicy mustard that was truly exceptional It would be great on pretzels The burger while pleasing was unexceptional The waffle fries were nicely spiced with just the right texture crunchy on the outside soft on the inside I was pleased with my meal but certainly wont wake up tomorrow craving it againI really like the Union Grill for lunch  The turkey burger is one of the best turkey burgers Ive ever had  Its a huge burger weighing in at a half pound  The fish taco is good but its really big and hard to pick up still delish  The pierogies are great  My husband has really enjoyed the turkey devonshire  trout almondine and the burgers  I also like that they usually have a hard cider availableRolled into Pittsburgh for the Carnegie Mellon graduation the hotel recommended this place for a nosh that was within walking distance of the hotel A great selection of local beers on tap AND PEROGIES Traditional and pot roast YUM Theres a menu item to scratch any itch Portions are ample What you see is what you get This is a straight out drink and stuffyourface kinda placeGreat location near Pitt Relaxing atmosphere older professor and professional crowd Good beer selectionandsmores at your table Yes I said smores No I did not partake though patrons were The perogies were GREAT The burgers are cooked to order and could feed two people Portions are generous service is adequatestaff is very nice Easy street parking via meter Very nice range on the menu and cheap wine for those who partake Give it a shot worth your dollarEh  all of my experiences here have been pretty average Its not bad  but Ive had better and the dinner wait is not worth itThe two times Ive been here for dinner Ive come in large groups  around 810 people Because they dont take reservations you have to wait around an hour to actually get a table Then once you get a table and order it takes at least another 3040 minutes to get your food I know service is generally longer for larger groups but this place is particularly slowThe first time I got the pot roast and the second time I got the six grain veggie I thought the pot roast was good at first but then after the sauce ran out I realized it was actually quite dry The veggie sandwich was good  but it didnt taste as good as the description sounded My boyfriend got the steak burger and turkey Devonshire  the turkey entree was okay and the burger was pretty good Ive also gotten the French onion soup as a starter which I likedI also did come once for lunch  this time only in a group of 2 While we were seated immediately it still took awhile to get our food  not ideal for lunch I got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries The turkey burger was good the sweet potato fries  eh Ive had better The one good thing I will say is that the portions here are pretty big  you will probably take home some leftovers Some of the food at this place is good  but I dont think its worth all the waiting If youre in a large group go somewhere else"

    "review":"Ive been to a lot of Korean restaurants including ones in New York City I visited Nak Won Garden twice Once I had Budae Jungol which was good but didnt settle with my stomach too well I also had one of my favorites jjambbong and it was the most unimpressive jjambbong Ive had There was a lot of squid but only one clam and one shrimp The soup was not as rich as many other places Service:The first time I was there the restaurant was really busy but the service was good The waitress came to check on us often The second time was during midafternoon when it wasnt busy at all But the waitress came only in the beginning to take my order and then at the end to give me a check It was like she was waiting for me to leave It didnt feel very welcomingI never write reviews but this was one legit meal The carpaccio was to die for and the service was outstanding I will definitely be going back soonWent with a group of friends yesterday at 6pm crowd started soon after we were sitted The food was very good: the thickness of the seafood pancake was just right and tasted very good and bibimbap was normal My friends shared a set of grilled meat I did not try hence no comment about the tasteThe service was another matter Restaurant was very short of staff and there were only 2 servers on the floor one presumably the owner As one can imagine the service was pretty erratic we asked for ban chan refills thrice and they came only around 1520min later water refills had to be asked and reminded as well And it was a disaster at the cashier as partly our fault we did not inform the server we wanted to pay with more than 1 cards before bill was printed did not realised it was an auto gratuity of 20 for a party of 6 and more which did not justify the level of service we received and the presumed owner had a problem with the program they used for cashier The experience was really stressed and I am not keen on returning However do go there if youre looking for a jobBeyond excellent  Get there early this place gets crowdedThis is the best Korean food Ive had anywhere on the planetand boy does it get crowded The staff is charming and friendly so perhaps go outside of peak hours when theyre more relaxed Not a ton of seating so not the best for big groupsWonderfullymarinated galbi hot supercrunchy bibimbap deeply flavored yukgaejang bright and rich soybean stew extraordinary jap chae Absolutely stellar food very highly recommendedWe came in on a Saturday night the place was packed but after 25 minutes or so we were seated Right away our waitress offered us hot tea and gave us menus My husband ordered the LA Galbi and I ordered dosolt bibimbap When my husbands dish came out we were surprised at the small potion of meat I remember saying 18 bucks for that The meat was chewy and the marinade was not as flavorful as we hoped My bibimbap was good and I enjoyed it I have found that no matter where you go you cant go wrong with ordering bibimbap When our bill came out we were surprised when we saw that we were being charged 2999 for the galbi We were sure we had seen 1799 When we asked our waitress she quickly apologized and said we had been served the large portion Problem was that when our order was taken we were never informed there was a small and large portion The large portion is not listed on the same page its on either the next page or one after that If we had seen that we would have specified It was their mistake and they were very apologetic but I cant see us going back It was just way too expensive I understand they they are a new restaurant but for the quality and portions its just not worth it for us to pay that much"

    "review":"Really big restaurant with traditional and classic decorations The atmosphere is quite relaxing The number of kinds of food is not big enough but the dishes are quite tasty The amount of food is not very big while the price is fair The time of food being prepared and served is way too long but the waiters and the boss are very friendly and niceI come to downtown Pittsburgh annually for a convention and I eat here at least once per trip Ive ordered from the regular menu in previous years and only noticed this year that they were also having a dinner buffet The buffet part of this restaurant is actually fairly mundane The selection is smaller than most Chinese buffets Ive been to From the regular menu on the other hand the pan fried noodles are pretty decentI had previously came here with a friend during lunch We went to the second floor for buffet But boy was I disappointed The food did not taste good at all the selection was very limited and the place did not look like it was clean enough I decided not to ever come back but decided to give it another try to see if the food that was to order was better We went to the first floor to check it out To our surprise they had a Chinese menu limited dishes I ordered one of my favorite dishes which was thick noodles with beef The food came 15 minutes later The serving amount was little and it didnt look like they had put much on it It was supposed to have things like carrots bean sprouts broccoli or veggies but it didnt have much The noodles tasted like nothing it had no flavor and it didnt look too appetizing  On top of that it was over 10 for that dish Overall did not enjoy the food thereAbsolutely the worst Chinese food Ive ever had I will never set foot in this place ever again I had to throw away more than half the dish because it was inedibleA well deserved one starI headed here with a few of my friends and ate on the first floor because the buffet was closed I ordered the curry squid rice and our food arrived relatively quicklyThe squid rice was dull kind of undercooked and tasteless The squid was definitely just chewy curled in sliced fish and was identified as tilapia by my culinary major friend The curry was in big yellow clumps tucked into the rice My friends got chewy general tsos and teriyaki vegetable beef where the sauce looked better than the actual foodOur leftovers have sat in our fridge for three weeks and we feel bad for wasting but its almost inedible Too expensive for something so lacklusterI have indeed experienced better  I usually eat upstairs which I would rate at 3 or 4 stars however this time I decided to try their first floor takeout menu and that was a mistake  I ordered General Tso with Fried Rice to go I expected a 10 to 15 minute wait  I waited 4 minutes  That should have been my first warning flag  I walked back to my office and opened it the smell seemed a little off  A couple bites into the meal I simply had to stop eating  At first I just thought I was being picky  but then a couple coworkers confirmed the food smelled funky  So  yeah  onestar until proven otherwise"

    "review":"Not only is the food delicious but the chief cookbottle washer and charming host Alex is a real treasure to his community He supports the local neighborhood gardens and helps hold that little corner of the universe together Vicki ChapmanIs this place out of business I called and left messages multiple times to make an appointment with no return callWe had a wonderful time and great food and plenty of it Plan to take my family ther the next time they are in townI decided on Joszas corner for a big family dinner to celebrate my grandmothers birthday She does not like going out to fancyexpensive places so after reading the reviews and finding out that after some research on ancestrycom she may be at least 50 Hungarian I called Alex to make reservations for a Sunday 12 people When I read the reviews I thought that I had a good idea of what it would be like but to be honest I was taken aback when we arrived To say that building was old would be the understatement of the century My family was surprised and a little worried after seeing the outside of the building This is not your typical chain restaurant set up This is what I would consider authentic If you went to visit your long lost relatives in Hungary and great grandma welcomed you to her home to serve you a big meal this is probably what her house would look like The fact that the restaurant shows its age and its use made it more real for me But dont expect frills and thrills Thats the foods job You have to walk through the small kitchen to get to the back room where three long tables are set up The tables are covered in plastic table cloths and there are plastic utensils and styrofoam plates in the middle The room is filled with pictures knick knacks and other memorabilia Alex also turned on some authentic music for ambienceWe opened the wine we brought and loosened our belts Then the food started Served family style Appetizers were first Amazing flat bread cabbage salad and a tomatopepper soupy concoction that blew me away Next course: peasant soup Think the warm flavorful chicken soup grandma would make you from scratch when you were sick Warms the soul Next up: cabbage and noodles My favorite with a few spices for a little kick on the classic Then the entrees came Transylvanian pork with cabbage and served with bread Then a chicken dish with noodles After all of the food was served Alex came out with a plate of dessertcrepetortilla type bread with chocolate chips and dates Alex then answered our questions about history and culture All of this for 20 a person We added a little extra for an extra tip All in all my family embraced the experience and had a wonderful time leaving full happy and with an appreciation for all the wonderful things we have todayI started off going to write a really bad review because I really didnt like the food And as for atmosphere this place is a hole in the wall literally There is a hole punched through the wall from the entrance which looks like an old bar to the room where you eat  You have to squeeze through the kitchen area also to get to the room with the tablesOur party of 3 were the only customers in the place for Saturday at lunchtime so Im not sure if that affected the food that was served I have to say that the bread that was served was great chewy crusty and warm The second serving was a homemade chicken soup that was also great tasting but was full of bones If you have children dont let them have the soup unless you check it first and carefully Some of the bones were very small The next was halushki which was ok but very greasy Then some kind of potato dish with paprika and vinegarI didnt like this sour dish at all then came pork and sauerkraut chicken and noodles both of which I had to ask what it was because the meat was just a condiment in these There was no meat pieces bigger than your fingernailSomewhere in the mix a cucumber salad was served and it was wonderful  Nothing was served fresh except the bread everything was pre made and heated up for our meal  For this meal we were charged 20 each and mostly our food was cabbage noodles not homemade and canned sauerkraut flavored with meat bits and paprika but there was lots of it I admit that I dont know much about Hungarian food so I looked up multiple web sites  for Hungarian recipes and what was made seems authentic and Im sure that his grandmother had to use little meat to make ends meet but I would have liked it better   to have less food with better quality foodOld world hungary meets mid century Pittsburgh via your host AlexHe shares with you stores of how his Hungarian grandmother made the dishes and he strives to keep the dishes traditional We learned how he keeps his crepes fluffy and bread soft and seasons his dishes to savory perfection The atmosphere is homey with embroidered Hungarian wall hangings and old world kitchen and a Victorian couch I dubbed the fainting couch because we were all so full I was sure I needed to lay down before the last courseThe food is savory and peasant style this means meat sauce or juice lots of spices and egg noodles Seems to be a balance of salty cabbage maybe paprika and cumin chicken and i believe beef were in the main dishes Lots of homemade bread for dunking A cucumber salty almost pickled salad with dill and sour cream Crepes and cookies for desert mm and a very sweet traditional toast to our birthday girlTips: if you run out of food ask for more he is happy to bring out more bowls full park around the back on the other side of train tracks youll see what I mean when you get thereBYOB red or white wine go well with these dishesPlan for at least two hours or three hours ever eaten a course meal in FranceIt is kind of like that no Then just plan for 3 hours youll need to pace yourself and he cooks as you eatWe paid 20 per person this included the tipEvery time I had driven by this place I had thought it was closed what a pleasant surprise to find its not"

    "review":"Tako  Even the name is cool  If you havent yet make an effort to try this place  The outdoor bar seats right at the kitchen counter are absolutely the way to go and well worth the wait to nab  So tacos  I mean they have other food  But tacos  For glutensensitive peeps they are more than willing to sub out a corn tortilla for flour if you request itlet them know youre glutenfree  The only taco thats permanently gluteny is the breaded fish taco  Bummer but so many other delicious choices like the mushroom taco  So yum  Meaty perfect maitake shrooms with a garlic aioli truffle huitlacoche salsa and brussel sprout salad  It makes my mouth so happy  Also the guac is really really good  Its fresh and quality and thick and they do this thing where you choose your funky addins that make it even more awesome  Dont be afraid to try that weird combo  You know you wanna  Aaand the gin fizz was pretty cool  I loved the addition of avocado and rose water and making it with Jarritos was a good choice as wellGreat atmosphere good vibe  a cooland cool ambience Great place to take a date The food is super fresh and cocktails are also Might be the best tacos you will have tasted I would definitely go backErica our server was awesome The octopus was done well but somewhat lacking on flavor Korean taco was amazing Guacamole was also fresh Great atmosphere A mustBelieve the hypeWeve been wanted to eat here for a while but often our plans are last minute and this place is always packed  We were lucky early last Saturday night and scored a table outside  It wasnt too cold yet and they had heaters set up  I love the guacamole  they start with a base and then have a list of items to mix in sort of like you find at ice cream shops  We tried blue cheese and mango  While it was good the blue cheese was a bit strong for the guac but thats really our fault for selecting it  I definitely want to try new combinations  We had a Poke which is raw sushi tuna with delicious lime foam on crispy rice crackers  A couple of the rice crackers had stuck together and were a tad oily but it didnt detract from the dish  At the recommendation of our server we had Korean Beef Tacos  All I can say is Yum  The Neville Island Ice Tea was a nice twist on the drinks and I also had a seasonal pumpkin margarita  While it was good there wasnt much pumpkin flavor  Pittsburgh needs more places like this  Great food great atmosphere and reasonable prices  I cant wait to bring some out of town visitors so they can taste the new Pittsburgh restaurant scene    Taking in to account atmosphere quality and price this could be the best restaurant in the cityIf there is a downside its only that the food is so good its always packed  Be sure to make reservationsI have only been here twice but Im in love Ive sat both outside and inside I did prefer inside because of the atmosphere but outside was still fun for people watching Both times I got the Bistec taco it is amazing Im a pretty picky person and I didnt change anything about this The food is so fresh and smells amazing I wish there was more food to an order 2 tacos per order but thats only because of how good it is I do get full from the 2 tacos because they are pretty loaded up so wanting more is just me being greedy : I am not able to drink tequila but I still wanted  a Margarita and the staff was super nice and accommodating about which ones would be best to replace with vodka The staff is amazing everyone Ive experienced so far has been really friendly I cant wait to go back and try the guacamole menu and some different tacosGreat food and service Both time i dined at Tako i sat at the outside bar and service was great food excellent and drinks amazing Prices are very reasonable two tacos for 1214 I would suggest you cehck this place out while in town Its small and very busy so get there before the dinner rush or after"

    "review":"Typical dive bar during the week with an expected tasting lunchdinner menu nothing too special but it hits the spot Different specials go on every day but if youve never gone to Cappyoke on Friday nights 9:30pm2am youre missing out on my favorite weekly tradition Place is small but service is always quick try to get there early to grab a table or seat or you will be left standing all night as they fill up fast  Drinks are priced average so no complaint there eitherHow does this place survive in the middle of Walnut Street  I understand how people like to wait in line for hours for breakfast on a Sunday but I WOULD NOT do it for a place like this  Given our first mistake was going for breakfast at a place labeled a dive bar on yelpbut still  Perhaps the wait wasnt meant to be an hour but our waitress definitely FORGOT OUR ORDER and we sat there wondering what could be so tricky about some eggs and toast  one hour and one complaint laterThe food arrives  Hot sauce was more difficult took two requests before it came  Of course I arrived last and ordered 30 min after everyone else but my food came first  The food is basic and inexpensive you get what you pay for  In summary my Shadyside friends unless its a beautiful day and you just want to sit outside their only plus is they have a few outside tables keep on going down Walnut for some better optionsAvg food too saltyGreat dive atmosphere but not dive prices  Not necessarily GROSSLY overpriced but just enough that it doesnt make sense  700 for a craft beer in a dive  CmonCappys We went here for karaoke night and stayed til close We didnt try any food but ordered plenty of drinks We sat at a table and the waitress was super attentive and checked back often to see if we needed another drink It was a full house but not too full where you cant move The Karaoke was good and you could tell there were some regulars hitting the stage There were a few times they didnt have songs someone in our group requested which we thought was a little weird because they were top 40I cameHere for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place I was  Starters food is nothing outta the ordinaryone funny thing that stood out was when we asked our server if they served any other meats aside from pork based meats she responded BACON And no not turkey bacon So clearly lil off there  Other then that we order common breakfast  Which was ok I had the western omelette with turkey sausage  The peppers and the onions were not sliced small enough and were overpoweringly huge  Lil less On that lil more on the egg Which I wonder if the eggs were made from liquid base out of a carton  Yeah so place was ok if u wanna eat in desperation "

    "review":"Average food at high priceLet me begin by saying that I have a loyalty to Starwood properties  I seem to always experience the best and have enjoyed food from the very best of the chefs from Luxury Collection properties all the way down to amazing food at Sheraton properties  I have also worked in the food industry and while I know I am critical of service I am very understanding when service or food does not meet expectationsFrom start to finish this meal was definitely in the top for being the worst ever all around And I say this not because the food was bad but the service was awful  Let me start with the very beginning  When we walked in there were only three tables in the restaurant and it took a while for someone to even come to the hostess desk  In the meantime I saw another couple seat themselves because they too had been waiting before our group for who knows how long  Finally a polite gentleman came up and asked if  we would be dining with them this evening and when I said yes he said okay one moment and walked away  He went to fix our table and came back and got us  Upon sitting a sweet girl came over immediately and filled our waters and we waited for our server to come by  We ordered our cocktails and some of us ordered a glass of wine  The waitress then proceeded to ask about what our second choices were in case they did not have it  I was definitely surprised by this After some time she brought out our drinks We were sitting and enjoying our company and ordered our first courses  She never described anything about the menu or made any recommendations Someone at the table ordered the onion soup and stated that it was way too salty and tasted like it had been in the pot cooking for days and had reduced to something that was not edible The waitress finally came back to check on us about 35 minutes later after someone in the group went and got her  We had been waiting to reorder our drinks for a long time and our plates were just sitting  She pulled the firstcourse plates and when she came across pulling the soup she said oh I am sorry I took your soup The friend replied that she did not like the soup and could not eat it because it did not taste well the server said nothing more and walked away  We were finally able to order both our meals and drinks at this time  The drinks came ten minutes later half delivered by another server The food came out 45 minutes later Mind you nothing was prepared more than medium rare at the table and there were still only 5 other tables in the restaurant  The waitstaff appeared to be invisible almost the entire time  The only person really working was the sweet girl who delivered our water as she was cleaning the tables and refilling waters Our food came out and was actually tasty Everyone really enjoyed their food  However no one ever came by to ask how it was  It is such a pity for a chef to have to have their food serviced from a staff like this  Unfortunately it ruins the experience  We had to get up to ask for the check because we could not see our server anywhere and when we got the check with the soup still charged that was not even eaten and clearly stated that it was not enjoyable it took a long time to even get back Sadly this experience was so awful I had to write about it Usually I never really feel the need to say anything about it  But this was different I can guarantee that none of us will ever return hereI probably like this place more than others  If youre lucky you get a nice view of the city and river  Try the potato pancake  youll like it  The steak will surprise you  It is better than most  I like this place than most of the upper tier chain steak places in PittsburghThis restaurant sits inside the Sheraton hotel atrium  It has a beautiful view of the city from across the Mon River  A train will pass along every 30 minutes  This is a pricy steak restuarant so I expected Capital Grille or Mortons quality  Service was awkward and slow on the Saturday night I was there  My steak ordered medium was closer to well done  A side is included with each entree but none of the choices were anything to write home about  My friends like the lobster bisque and the cotton candy they serve as a complimentary treat after the meal   Pittsburgh Rare was kind of unimpressive for the priceWent with a party of 8 for my friends Bachelor Party  Well start with the good: Had the Pittsburgh Potato Pancake  It was pretty good  I wouldnt have known there was bacon on it had the menu not mentioned it but pretty much everyone at the table enjoyed it and there was enough that 8 guys were all able to have a bit of itThe entres were fantastic Since I dont think cows are all that tasty I had and enjoyed the crabcakes  A good amount of crab not too much breading at all  The roasted corn ancho chile sauce was a great compliment to themEveryone else had steak and all loved it  The only complaint was the coffee and cocoa crusted flat iron steak was incredibly small  Temperatures ordered ranged from medium rare to medium well  It looked to me like everything was cooked less than requested but no one was upset at doneness  They looked delicious  Its a joy to see a well cooked steak  Made me wish i liked eating themThe cotton candy after the meal  Awesome  Would have skipped the underwhelming dessert had I know it was comingThe bad: Wed heard about how before ordering the meats were presented and explained  We did not get this service but did see it other tables getting itOur groups wine snob described the wine list as terrible  Nobody likes him though  Our waitress didnt seem to know what beers they had  The draft selection was limited to Buds finest  When asked what they had in bottles she replied almost everything before shooting down several requests Dogfish Head Stella Artois and Newcastle are a few I remember off the top of my headThe guys that ordered the french onion soup thought it was delicious but were upset that it was barely warm to the point it was hard to break through the cheeseDessert looked fantastic but wasnt so good to eat  The chocolate cake is incredibly rich but merely ok  The warmed apple tart came coldThey apparently dont believe in serving coffee with dessert either as it came out a good 15 minutes after and they neglected to offer milk or sugar If youre just going for dinner and arent concerned about the extras like service the steaks were considered fantastic by all  If you want a full restaurant experience as you should be entitled to for their prices you might be better off finding another place in the cityWe have eaten twice now at Pittsburgh Rare Both times the restaurant was not packed but we had bad service both timesLast night we went for a nice New Years Eve dinner They had a special menu for New Years Eve No they didnt add items they removed all side dishes and many of the entrees At least the filet mignon was still on the menuWe waited almost 10 minutes to order and the service went downhill from there Slow drink refills very long time between courses As far as we could figure out our waitress was waiting on us and a couple of other tables and she was working the reception in the ballroom next to the restaurantWe may go back but I doubt it The great tasting food doesnt make up for the horrible service 4 stars for the food 1 for the service"

    "review":"I ate from their food stand and its one of the best gyros Ive had in Pittsburgh The meat and onions were really juicy and flavorful and the tzatziki was really garlicky The grape leaves were also juicy and flavorful Highly recommendedThis gyro stand has the best gyros I have ever eaten hands down  The portion sizes is huge enough for two people but you are gonna want your own Served on a crisp pita tons of flavorful meat fresh vegetables on top and they will grill you onions if prefer all served with a cool delicious taziki sauce that tops it off perfectly This gyro is as authentic as youre going to get and for a really great priceThey also have some really good vegetarian options and they also have a platter that serves almost every item you can get at the stand  The owner  cook is a very nice guy very attentive to the quality of the food and always makes sure his customers leave with a smile and a full belly Its definitely worth a drive down the Main Street in Braddock on Saturdays to pick up a gyro at the Brew Gentlemens Brewery I have seen the stand at other events and locations too Follow them on Facebook and Instagram to find out if the are adding additional days and locations and get some crazy delicious gyrosIF you like gyros this is by far the one to try Absolutely   the best cant say enough good things about Gyros and natTry it you will love itBest Gyros Ever Make sure you ask for grilled onions that is key Also give a try to the hummus and pitas as well as the baklava You wont be disapointed Priced right for the mounds of food you getDownright the best Gyro Ive ever had Great value  7 for a pound of deliciously roasted Greek Goodness The pita is warm and fluffy and delicious Grilled onions for no extra charge Thats what Im talking about I waiting in line for 45 minutes in 40 degree weather and dont regret a thing"

    "review":"Waited over 2hrs for my order Fine a busy Friday night It was nothing that I had ordered I get being late but I didnt pay 20 for stuff I dont even eat Thanks for the refund grubhubPlease save your money and time and DONT order from this place I ordered almost 70 worth of food and it took them 2 hours to deliver it After the first hour i called and was told that my food was on the way and had just left An hour later there was still no food I called again and the employee who answered the phone was extremely rude He said Well its Saturday and we are busy I understand that weekends are busy but then they shouldnt have said my food would only be 40 minutes When the food finally came it was cold and TERRIBLE I called to speak with a manager and for 2 days in a row they told me he wasnt there Finally i got in touch with someone and they were just as rude He said The best i can do for you is give yiu 10 off of your next order I explained to him that i would NEVER be ordering from them again So his response was Well then i dont need to do anything for yo And hung up Never had such bad food or service in my lifeGinos has great pizza at an affordable price  Their staff is quality and they keep the rif raf from the night clubs moving  Definitely a stop for after the barsAffordable pizza quality slices and pretty damn good strombolis The guys that work the counter are friendly and make this place a viable option when it comes to craving pizzaUnfortunately though Id have to agree with Darrenits time for new pizza recipes We already have a huge pizza presence in South Side and everyone makes pretty much the same pizza After a night out on East Carson however it doesnt really matter how many of the same pizza joints are around because theyre all full and all of them provide you with the same wonderful hazy memory the next morningIll miss Blue Grotto but I also wont complain because this place still satisfiesWe have been trying new pizza places recently and decided to give Ginos a go since we somehow received a flyer from them with some pretty good coupons Everything is great We ordered wings pizza and a hoagie and everything was definitely above average Im over the commercialized pizza that places like Pizza Hut and Dominos offer and this was nothing like that Another positive was the fact that when the food was delivered it was still hot and even steaming They have a great menu selection as well We will definitely be ordering againNot really that great Sub par pizza The people are nice but the place is dirty and not worth the money"

    "review":"Chipotle goes Greek My boyfriend and I decided to explore Mount Lebanon but by the time we arrived it was way past lunchtime After looking through some menus on windows we decided to go here for a quick casual meal Around 2:30 on the weekend the store is not too busy The staff were very friendly and helpfulthey patiently explained how to order what the toppings were and how our choices affected the pricing The setup is very much like Chipotle You pick a pita whole wheat or white small or regular or bowl rice or salad a meat a variety of options include gyro and chicken and stack on the toppings There are also sides and desserts There are several tables in the store which is brightly lit We walked down the block to Clearview Commons to enjoy our lunch I ordered a whole wheat regular pita They brush the pita with oil and toss it on a grill to warm for a few minutes I added gyro meat which is freshly shaved from the spit Then I was faced with the toppings Rice: lemon rice brown rice with lentils or lentils Beans: green beans navy beans or green beans with potatoes in tomato sauce I always considered green beans more of a vegetable but this is cool too Sauce: Greek yogurt tzatziki or sour cream tzatziki Cold toppings: lettuce tomato chickpeas several types of olives peppers And they add whatever you want carefully piling the toppings onto the pita I got a little nervous at the height of my pita and limited myself but Ill go all out next time Then they wrap it up and you have a delicious warm pita ready to be devouredThe pita was a little messy to eat All the toppings mashed together into a medley of flavors Between bites I noticed the gyro was well seasoned the pita was warm and soft something the green beans was buttery the Greek yogurt tzatziki lent just the right amount of moisture and everything tasted fresh and delicious My boyfriend and I agreed that it was a hearty yummy meal for a reasonable price I hope to return soonI had a short bit of time before an appointment and ran in here for the first time I like that its not a sit down restaurant so we were in and out with some delicious food I got a big salad with gyro meat and was happy that they could customize it so I didnt have to get the feta cheese It was a fantastic salad The atmosphere is cute and clean and the service was great Im happy to know there is a second location in Market Square and plan on visiting there soonIf I could give this place 10 stars I would Having recently moved to Pittsburgh I have been rather disappointed in the lack of quality restaurants  lots of greasy mom and pop joints using very lowquality ingredients There seems to be pizza and gyro shops on every corner and I had been unimpressed with all of them Then I found The Simple Greek This is a Chipotlestyle buildyourown gyro shop Excellent quality ingredients actual spring greens instead of shredded iceburg etc but I was most happy to see they had a great selection of addon ingredients Finally a gyro shop that offers actual Mediterranean ingredients like kalamata olives and feta PLUS lots of other items like lentils or rice green beans tomatoes onions cukes and on and on Whole wheat pita and yogurt tatziki sauce make healthy substitutesI order the bowl and it is HUGE Seriously I could make a meal out of just the meat portion alone  they do not skimp And you can choose chicken or steak in addition to traditional lamb The rice pudding and baklava are super yummy also Please please come check this place out  you wont regret itThe menu is ok not stellar  The best thing is their Lemon rice  Incredible  The rest was mehFood was ok servers were good but nothing authentic about the taste  Grape leaves were nasty and had uncooked hard rice  A little too pricey for a 8 gyro sandwich that i can get for half the price everywhere elseVery friendly staffI have been there twice  Very fresh food   You can choose rice ricelentils mix or lentils as base for bowl Chicken had excellent flavor  There are 2 versions of green beans  both very tastey  There is a variety of fresh topping  cucumbers feta olives tomatoes  onions lettuce etc  Saucesdressings available  I liked their signature sour cream one although the yogurt one was good tooI have tried both the side orders of vegetarian grape leaves and meat ones  both very goodThink of it like a Greek version of Chipotle but betterVery filling and tasty   The only reason I gave it 4 stars street parking is limited The parking garage is right  near by  and you can get 1 hr free validated parking  It was just takes time to find parkingwalk  weekdays especially lunch time during week and SaturdaysStaff is 5 starsThey take credit cards and have takeout"

    "review":"Ate here this evening with my son and father  They both had gnocchi and said it was very good with a wonderful tomato sauce  I had rigatoni with hot sausage  Sauce was very goodcould have drained pasta first but delicious nonetheless  Sausage was good   For an app we had stuffed hot peppers that were to die for   Only gripe is pop in cans that each of us paid for 2cans each  Finally a real Italian restaurant in a predominantly Italian neighborhoodLets start with the positive as there was a lot  This is a cute Italian BYOB in a great location on Brookline Boulevard It is a welcome addition to the neighbor after the closing of the previous Italian restaurant that located this store front  We made reservations for a Saturday night and were greeted warmly by the owners when we arrived as they were just cleaning up from a large party The menu is not huge but enough items that everyone will be able to find something  The prices are very reasonable with entrees from 89 and specials which include a salad from  1314 Our wine bottles were quickly opened and the service the entire night was fantastic  I love a small local place where you get to meet the owners  We started off ordering the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer It was delicious but I was a little put off by the paper plates it was served on  Also the napkins were what you would buy at Target and have in your own home  Anyway once I got over that our orders came out quickly I went with the spaghetti and 2 meatballs which you also could have gotten with penne Honestly it was not fantastic and a mediocre pasta dishthe sauce was a bit watery  My fianc ordered one of the casseroles and I was expecting something similar to lasagna Instead it was a bowl of your choice of noodles and meat with a ton of cheese melted on top  They had way too much cheese on top which was overpowering  Others in our party ordered a salad and lasagna which got good reviews  The cork fee was 5 and they were nice enough to let us relax after dinner and enjoy the evening We were not rushed out which is rare these days  I really would like to go back and try the Sicilian pizza on the menu  They do have takeout and another family shared a large pizza and it looked tremendous It is hard to fine Sicilian style pizza in Pittsburgh  The place is very small but the owner said it is very kid friendly which is a plusStreet parking right on Brookline Boulevard dont forget to feed the meter My friend and I stopped in to this place around 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday wed skipped lunch but were hungry so we figured wed have lunner I was craving pasta and we saw this place as we were driving by and decided to give it a tryThis is a BYOB establishment with a reasonable 200 corkage fee compared to other restaurants in the area Ive experienced  NOTE:  There is a Wine and Spirits store 2 doors down  We werent in the mood to have an alcoholic beverage with our meal so we didnt take advantage of this perk at this time though Im certain I will in the future The menu is one page there are only about 30 items listed  The dining area is small but clean and quaint We were the only customers there again: it was 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday and there were two gentleman working one who said he was the owner and I guess the cook  They both greeted us warmly and both took turns serving us in chatting with them we learned that the special of the day was gnocci that their sauce and meatballs were the best and that they had only opened about 2 weeks agoWe ordered a Sprite water a tossed salad 495 a 7 Garlic Bread 300 spaghetti and meatballs 875 and rigatoni with tomato sauce 700  Each pasta dish came with plain bread and butter but we wanted garlic bread too we were both craving starchesThe food really hit the spot  The salad seemed fresh the pasta dishes were yummy the bread was goodThe bill came to 2750 for the two of us  I tipped 20 even though we werent technically served by a server I wanted to make certain I showed my appreciationThe only criticisms I have is that I asked for a glass of water and was brought a bottle of water which I was charged for and a glass of ice they dont have any dessert options and I didnt notice any kids menu optionsThey also offer hoagies and thick square Sicilian pizzas I plan to go back and try that the next time Im in the area and craving pizzaIts not fine dining  If youre a foodie who needs ambiance in your restaurant flair in your service andor a lot of pomp and circumstance in the preparation or presentation of your food you might not enjoy this place If you want a good wellprepared reasonably priced nofrills meal while experiencing some honest simple friendly service youll be very happy patronizing this establishmentWe stopped in for a bite to eat looking for some pasta for take out  The restaurant is small with about 6 or 7 tables some for 2 or 3 and a couple for 4 It use to be another restaurant that we had been to once years agoFound out it is BYOB for 5  YeaI had the rigatoni with hot sausage and tomato sauce  The rigatoni was cooked al dente and the hot sausage were very good  I thought the tomato sauce was OK could use a little more seasoning for my taste Received some warm buttered bread with the meal  We were talking to the owner and he grew up in the neighborhood and had a shop on the Northside but closed that and then found this spaceWill have to stop back and try the pizza"

    "review":"I hate to post anything negative  but seriously this place was one of the worst  We werent expecting top of the line anythingbut everything about this place was bad  The place was pretty dirty the coffee was like water we waited close to an hour for our food apparently the cook decided to leave for about 45 minutes the waitressowner was more interested in drinking beers with another set of customers at 9:30 in the morning than checking on us  The food was beyond badohand ice cold  The waitress the one time she came over literally spilleda good amount of coffee on our table and just walked back to her drinking buddies  It was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive barDive may be an understatement but the breakfast soars Huge portions served quickly and piping hot And prices consistent with the ambiance Two blocks from the bike trail is a plusAwesome place Have been having weekly breakfast with my daughter for 10 years now Huge omelets awesome coffee and one of the better cheese burgers around for that price range I know every time I walk in that I will have a great mealWe went to Mullins for breakfast on a day they were having a large party for a separate group so I think the staff were not sure how to handle the rest of the customersSo we entered the waitress made eye contact and did not say seat yourself or anything  That was really just awkward  A few minutes latter we just sat downThankfully a fellow irishman who I assume owns the place saw that we had sat down and directed a waitress to take our order and he seemed to have to remind her to take care of our stuff  I dont think they would have bothered otherwise so thats the 1 star Maybe thats normal Maybe its because they had a large groupHowever since we were taken care of the food came out quickly Let me tell you it is worth it  The food is cheap hot good and plenty of it  I mean this is the best breakfast I have had locallyI got the big breakfast option  Awesome  Hot cakes eggs sausage all done just rightand CHEAP I mean I had a weeks worth of calories for two people for under 25 bucks with tipThe decor is not shale we say nice or even matching and has an odd irish theme but serves no irish themed food  Who care  Just go get yourself a big plate of hashAh Mullins No not Mullens which is something I always have to clarify when someone asks if I want to meet them for lunch at one of these places while Im at work This isnt the bar and grill located near PNC Park its a little diner that stands alone on a corner as you drive past the Warhol and continue towards the David McCullough Bridge Its easy to miss or just drive on by which is kind of a shame because this is a pretty nice spot to eat I think It can admittedly be a little offputting to walk in if youre not expecting their seating arrangement which consists of a mix of booths regular tables and foldup tables along with chairs that youre more likely to find in a school than a diner But food wise this is definitely the place to go for cheap greasy diner eats They make breakfast as well as lunch and I have to say their breakfasts look pretty good three egg omelets with a side dish Holy crap Ive mostly ordered their sandwiches and burgers and thought they were pretty good overall As long as you come in expecting diner food and nothing else I think youll like what you findA note  this place charges a fee for using a creditdebit card when you spend under 10 and their food is so cheap that you can spend less than 10 very easily So bring cashOff the beaten path but a delightful little hole in the wall place Breakfast was huge and tasty Eggs over easy almost perfect and the pancakes were quite good   Free parking and breakfast under 20 for two makes this an excellent value"

    "review":"Pretty good little Mexican place at the Waterfront   The chips and salsa were subpar fajitas were good and the drinks were all made very strong  Overall a good restaurant I would return to but nothing to get excited aboutGood food served quickly and accurately and fast to bootWe love going here and I really enjoy it every single timeThe only reason I drop one star is that it lacks any sort of options that might even be considered  okay for you  The food while delicious is pretty bad for you  If youre counting calories head elsewhere  Looking for a great way to cheat and get your pants sized worth  You can do worse than herePrices are also very reasonableI was so pleased to find out that in that fake little village that is the Homestead Waterfront there is an actual familyownedandoperated restaurant among all the corporates  Its right next to The Improv and as far as Im concerned its the best place to have a meal before the show  Ive been there twice now and even though Ive been to some of the best Mexican restaurants in Southern California this place made me smile  Want a BIG margarita  Theyve gotm  BIGGER  Theyve gotm  A PITCHER OF MARGARITAS  Yep theyve gotm  Great service an incredible selection of Tequilas that youve never heard of and yes really good margaritas on the rocks  not frozenMy experience with the food has been mixed  The stuffed pablano peppers are awesome  The fish tacos are superb  The Carnitas Verde is THE BEST thing Ive tried on the menu  They came up short on their enchiladas  I would have to say that either somebody blew it in the kitchen the night I had an enchilada or they just dont know that there is more than just a change of tortilla that differentiates a burrito from an enchilada  I was a little disappointed but not surprised to find out that the beef in the burritos and enchiladas is ground beef and there didnt seem to be an option for shredded beef  I will definitely be back to this place to explore more of the menuDo Not Go Here I walked past here this morning 9:33am and their was Dirty Plates cups and other  items left on multiple tables near the window the ones near East Bridge Street RoadI liked Gran Agave a little more than Darren did but was still disappointed since Id been wanting to come here for a while The best thing I had was the black bean soup with rice which was very hearty Darrens churros with ice cream were also decent My combo 8 came with an enchilada blah they use something to stretch out the ground meat in some way and it tasted funny a tamale not bad Mexican rice soso and fried beans one bite was enough The decor was cute though and our server was really nice and helpful I dont think Id want to returnAs an avid lover of Mexican cuisine I would not classify this restaurant as serving Mexican cuisine but rather a cheap watereddown version of American Mexican The food at Gran Agave was bland tasted like ingredients from a can and removed the essence of what makes Mexican cuisine one of the most vibrant and enjoyable I had a lunch special with a taco and enchilada The enchilada was soggy and the prevalent flavor was grease despite the generous amount of sauce included in the plate The taco was American style with lettuce and cheese and again very greasy ground beef in a hard shell There was nothing authentic about the food and it was an extremely underwhelming experience overall The lasting impact of the food was found in the terrible heartburn I experienced I have never eaten at a restaurant before that deserved zero stars but this one surely did"

    "review":"Its the only life in a dead mall directly downtown in PburghIts got that 60s bomb shelter chic to it and its just weird walking in because there is NO LIFE hereA mall downtown where you have to pay to park at itCompared to the Galleria you can find a parking meter and throw a buck in and enjoy SOME life in a downtown mallworst place  do not even tryppl working in Allegheny center do not have many options and i believe this is the last hope to eat before they die thats when they do business i go well prepared for lunch or try to drive a bit to get something better eat here only if you have no ither optionWowza some of these other reviews are just harsh and I feel unwarranted I typically wouldnt take the time to review a place like this but I felt obligated Its an upscale cafeteria style set up owned by the EatnPark Group with cafeteria pricing I find the pricing is reasonable The special sandwich today was turkey bacon and Brie is 799 and includes a side and drink  They serve salads sandwiches pizza and a have a griddle Not sure what people are expecting for 7 dollars They mix it up with specials each day and I have found the staff to be accommodating and friendlyEco Bistro is a decent placeThey are part of Parkhurst Dining Services which is part of Eat N Park They offer breakfast from 7am to 9:30 am and lunch from 11am to 2pm Monday through Friday Eco Bistro is broken up into three cooking stations Pizza n At that offers different types of pizzas everyday Sequoia Grill which offers breakfast items such as pancakes sausage eggs omelets home fries and breakfast sandwiches during breakfast time and burgers hot dogs and fries during lunch time  Between the Bread makes made to order sandwiches and wraps with different types of deli meats cheeses and toppings There is also a salad bar in the middle of the space were you can make what ever type of salad you want There are also pre made sandwiches and salads in the cooler if you are in a hurry and dont want to wait There is a Smoothie Station as wellWhen Eco Bistro first opened the food was really good and the prices were more than fair now to the food is average and the prices are high Example 6 for a grilled chicken sandwich Eco Bistro was added to the building for all of the PNC employees at the other end so I guess its better than the alternative Cool Beans which is absolutely grossThose of us who work in Allegheny Center and get 30 minute lunches dont have many options Eco Bistro takes advantage of that A few years ago the food was decent and prices soso Somewhere along the line the food quality tanked and prices kept increasing Pizza was my goto for when I didnt have time to pack my lunch It was good and only 5 for 2 big slices However they changed their sauce recipe and its way too sweet now and just gross The cheese is sparse now and half of the time its burnt or stale The chicken ranch pizza is about the only acceptable pizza option left And FYI never NEVER order the BBQ pizza Their homemade BBQ is heavy on the ketchup taste NastyThe cooksservers can be a tad ornery and seem to not care at all Reviewer Ken A is right about getting attitude when ordering something specialwhich is odd at a place seemingly designed to cater to MTO style food And god forbid they do something wrong which will be looked upon as your fault for making them do it again instead of just eating your cold panini that is missing cheese on a mozzarella basil paninithe special for that day The salad bar is priceyexpect to shell out 7 minimum for a small container with no heavy items in itThe cashiers are nice but dont expect any favors like telling you that something is going to be an additional charge Or if you get a premade wrap that has barely anything in itwell thats just how things are they measure that stuff DealThe lines are SLOW If there is more than two people in line for food and you are in a hurry forget it 1015 minutes easy to get a burger or wrap at peak lunch times Overall this place is all phoney facade The environment and prices suggest highend you know BISTRO food but instead you get the equivalent of some crappy food stand at a state park I guess I should thank them though because they have saved me a lot of moneyI always remember my lunch nowAwful and expensive Dont even want to waste my time writing a review on this place"

    "review":"After my 5 th time it never seems to fade The want for moreWas excited to see a food truck downtown  I parked in the strip and walked about 15 minutes to get to it  The pricing was a little high in my opinion  8 for a burger  It was pretty meaty but still 8 is a lot  That being said I dont like massive meat patties on burgers  All I could taste was the beef and not the toppings  I know some people like that but its not for me  I always order a little burger at 5 guys too because I like to taste toppings in addition to the burger  Like I said some people will like that but its not for me  They have interesting burgers of the day  Mine had pot roast and onion rings on it  I thought it was pretty unique and had a good taste  Overall Id say if you like the kind of burgers they serve its definitely worth a trySo I finally got to visit the BRGR truck I walked outside at work downtown and followed my nose to right outside of the Oxford Center Building where the truck resides They offer a slimmed down version of their restaurant menu which includes beef veggie or turkey burgersyour choice and various sides The burgers are 7 and the sides are typically 3 I got the steak burger very pink and it was delicious Its not as good as the competitions steak house burgerBurgatory but it still satisfied The staff are friendly and very quick I waited less than 5 minutes for my burger It was as I ordered it very pink and and presented well with a wooden holder to hold it together They also offer shakes as well just like the competition I still say if you want just a plain cheeseburger that Tessaros has the best tasting beef in Pittsburgh But if you work downtown and you want a delicious burger with multiple options then this truck is for you I will be going back again soon as it was pretty good for a food truckI had a turkey burger with cheese and milkshake that made me want to immediately pack up all my things at my desk and leave work It was that great In fact it was the highlight of my eight hour workday I dont eat beef or pork and was ecstatic that turkey was even an option It was cooked just right and boy it was juicy I wanted to finish all of it but my stomach was all girl youre full The milkshake wasnt watery it was thick and packed with flavor and I just cant wait to spot this truck again It gets five stars I would give it six but for obvious reasons I cannot Ive been to the restaurant BRGR and Im excited it now comes to youThe BRGR truck is now parked at the parking lot across from the courthouseForbes  Grant MF 11a3p This is a nice addition to the downtown lunch scene especially in light of Wingharts closing for renovations The truck has a pareddown menu consisting of about 5 beefveggieturkey burgersAll around 8 3 sides3 basic shakes4 and a few daily specials Interestingly the truck has brought back BRGRs old Add Foie Gras to anything policy  12 extra gets you a slice of guilty decadence The service on the truck is pretty quick our burgers were ready in under 10 minutes from ordering served to us in paper boat trays wrapped in tin foil There isnt really anywhere to sit in the parking lot of the truck so youll need to have somewhere else to eat especially in the cold Additionally we went around 1pm and there was a short line of about 3 people For more about the burgers you can read any one of the numerous reviews at the restaurant The food here is identical definitely not my favorite burgers in town My burger tasted like it got an excessive salt rub  big crunchy hunks of salt were charred to the bottom of my burger and while I like salty food it was way too much and overpowered the tiny bit of chipotle mayo Moreso than its food though the BRGR TRCKha is important politically Pittsburghs laws on food trucks are arcane and are inhibiting a lot of great businesses that are now operating only at events You can read more about the effort to get Pittsburghs laws changed here: http:pghmobilefoodcom  In the meantime though BRGRs truck is getting the word out that trucks can provide quick affordable lunches and increase the diversity of available food to downtown workers that would be otherwise unaware of these issuesSo go out and grab a burger and help Pittsburgh catch up to other cities with great and vibrant food truck communities Additional note: You can get the truck at your eventbusiness for a minimum food purchase of 500 for the first 2 hours More info on the website Cards accepted tooThis is my first time eating a burger that came off of a food truck and this will probably be my last timeI got the Average Joe and it was just okay   Ive definitely had better burgers     It wasnt an awful tasting burger but it was incredibly mediocre and boringThe reason why I will never eat here again is because I got violently sick immediately after eating this burger    It has been hours since Ive eaten this devil and it is still wreaking havoc on my digestive tract    Taste  just okayCleanliness  sanitation  very poor  stay away"

    "review":"Chef Wes is down right the most amazing caterer for everything He has skills and an ethic beyond any expectation If he created it made it or suggested itId be game If you havent dropped by his delimake it a point ASAP He wont disappoint thats for sureThe food is great and the customer service when Wesley is behind the register is top notch  Service like that is so hard to find nowadays  Everything I have ordered off the menu is fresh and delicious  The bacon is like none Ive ever had which makes the Polish Hill my favorite  The only downfall here is the younger guy who sometimes handles the register subbing in for Wesley  Hes usually doing the cooking when not behind the register and his attitude comes off like he doesnt want to be there and can be a little combative with customers  The customer is always right even when they are wrong  I get annoyed by people from time to time my wife would probably say thats an understatement but when youre in the service industry you have to hide your personal feelings and suck it up for the good of the business   Anything customers ask Wesley does it without hesitation  Thats pretty much the only negative when dining here  Dont let it deter you from trying it because if you get Wesley hell make sure youre leaving in a better mood than when you came in  Everybody else in the place is consistently friendly  And one more timedont leave without trying the baconI noticed this place a while ago mainly because they sell Boars Heads meats by the pound as well as serve breakfast and lunch so I stopped in one day strictly to buy some deli stuff for the BF The corned beef was wonderful which is not a surprise because its Boars Head but besides that they were so NICE They asked me if I had been there before and when I responded no they gave me a free soup to tasteit was delicious and a cookie and offered me a sodaThey really were wonderful I cant wait to go back for breakfast or lunch which looked amazing They have a pretty diverse menu as well Over all what I have tried was really good and REASONABLE not always the case in Downtown and the staff was over the top nice not usually the caseTiny deli with big taste They have a pretty great menu I always go for a Reuben sandwich when its offered and the one from Wesleys didnt disappoint The man behind the register Wes who I assume is the owner was very polite and friendly with all of the guests who came up Let them know of their options and of toppings they could change on the sandwiches thanked everyone for coming in and trying it out There were 3 other people working behind the counter a grill guy a sandwich builder and the QCorder completion gal who got whatever side you had ordered and handed you your bag of foodThe Reuben was good overall Bread was grilled but not too dry and rough also not soggy The sauerkraut was plentiful on top of the corned beef held together with swiss and thousand islands dressing  traditional Reuben style The redskin potato salad was the unhealthy side I chose and was a good addition to the sandwich They do have a small counter by the window with about 5 bar stools but we took ours to go When you check in on Yelp you get a coupon for a free cookie too Overall it was a great experience and I will be backThe soups are great here and so is Wes Friendly fast service Wes makes a point to introduce himself to new customers and gives them a free cookie which are quite good  The soups are hearty and choices change daily Personal favorite so far is lentil  vegetables They use Boars Head meat in the sandwiches which is high quality  also sell it by the pound They have great sandwich choices and I like how they are named after different areas of PittsburghToday wasnt my first stop at Wesleys Deli but it may be my last  And only because there are several good sandwich locations nearby and closer to me and what I got was not what I was expectingI phoned first to order what their menu calls the POINT PARK sandwich described in their menu as follows: Marinated portabella mushroom topped with roasted red peppers melted picante provolone cheese served with lettuce and tomato on 7 grain breadWhen I arrived and paid the gentleman at the register named on my receipt as owner Wesley calls out to the counter person who answers back that my sandwich  is not in fact prepared or ready  For my inconvenience Wesley says that I can pick out a cookie or brownieWhen the counter man calls out POINT PARK I went to retrieve my sandwichAnd what I got was some sort of quinoa looking goo topped with two tomato slices on a brioche bun  And the quinoa goo was coldThere is certainly a chance that the wrong sandwich was made or picked up but I will say that a there was only myself and one other person waiting for a sandwich and b when counterman called out POINT PARK this was the sandwich bag in his hand  so you decideIve posted pictures of what I picked up today  Total cost for this bland mistake was 1264 including tip which as I said before I paid before pick up and certainly before returning to my officeThey are probably nice people but with other options in this area I wont be returning"

    "review":"Overall a splendid experience  Excellent very tasty and wellpresented dishes and a very personable host to boot  Go and enjoyUnfortunately Sukhothai has gone downhill in the past year and food quality is well below par   The pad thai was completely uninspired  a blob of brownish noodles on a plate and not much else   The curry was reasonably flavorful but the sauce had broken due to overcooking and it wound up an oily mess   Even the water tasted off  tap water with no filter to speak of    There are much better options for Thai in Pittsburgh including Bangkok Balcony and Silk Elephant both less than one block away    Pass on this oneI really enjoyed this restaurant when it first opened The food is fairly good and the BYOB policy no corkage fee was very appealing I was going to Sukhothai on an almost weekly basis but then I had a very negative experience that has kept me from going backI ordered my usual dish and I noticed that it was 4 higher on the bill than on the menu I figured that it was an honest mistake and pointed it out to the server who was also the owner He pretended not to understand what I was talking about I asked him to bring the menu back so I could show him the listed price of the dish He said he would fix it I gave him my card and then he brought my bill back  and he had still overcharged me by 2 I never returnedThis may seem like a strong reaction to a small overcharge but there are so many Thai restaurants in Squirrel Hill that I refuse to eat at a restaurant with bad customer serviceThe food here is closer to 4 stars Ive eaten there twice and the first was a little more impressive than the second though thats likely partially due to dish choice the second dish was a red curry which tasted good but unremarkable The reason I m docking them a star is that the service while friendly was excessively slow on the second visitit took me 10 minutes of being very obviously finished and ready for the check to get the checkOrdered at 8:12pm  It is now 10:02pm and no food Awful Do not order  Unless you want to wait for 2 hours and not get your foodFOOD:We started with the dumplings as appetizers and they were very flavorful We continued onto sharing a small bowl of Tom Yum  we asked for Thai spicy and the kitchen didnt disappointI had the Panang Curry which was excellent and a pretty big portion for the price My better half had the Eggplant dish which he gave two big thumbs upOnly downside: they serve tap water which in Pittsburgh tastes like your local swimming poolSERVICEService was great Server was pleasant and quick No complaints VERDICTBill came to 37 for two meat entrees one app and one soup Would definitely come back  great taste and value"

    "review":"one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends good place to chill eat drink and watch the game and maybe some pool afterwards the food is not bad they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget dollar burger night where you build your own burger is fun but the patties can be dry sometimes so remember to get them sauced iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have the wings arent as good as you would like i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water but overall its a nice place to go because its cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as wellMy friends and I went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table He immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks Only another 30 minutes until he brought ONE martini over We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out He didnt get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part We werent the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset I hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second dayI absolutely love the ambiance of this place The bar area is very large and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot A solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back It doesnt generally get very crowded even on Friday and Saturday nights so dont expect a South Side type of environment All that being said there is a reason why this is a twostar review Even though this place doesnt get crowded it takes a very long time to get served I have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty barWell its 9pm on a Tuesday and no tater tots Dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature Not very happy Will try the station square bar Louie next timeI wanna love Bar Louie I do It seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes 20 minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us The food is good but the past 3 or 4 times Ive come theyve been out of tater tots by 9 PM and Im always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides its now time to tell the wait staff theyre out of something It may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the WaterfrontGood drink new old fashionedFood was so so shrimp tempura app but service was NOT good and I think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen Food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer  approx 20 mins with zero acknowledgment from my bartender  Shrimp were cooked well but sauces were extremely salty  sweet to be paired with tempura batter  The bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change Im not staying for a main course"

    "review":"We found ourselves here for the NL playoff game between the Pirates and the Cubs We had a group of 10 and got a nice table in the bar downstairs right under a tv for the perfect viewing experience My husband and I shared the chicken nacho appetizer and it was  great We will definitely be back for entrees and the good beer selection Our dining companions all got entrees and everything looked appropriately portioned and delicious The fish sandwich in particular looked really goodAlso I really like the old bar that was salvaged from the previous establishmentAbsolutely terrible service No chicken no fish and no turkey available after we ordered Took 15 minutes to get our alcoholic drinks and never got our waters Our entrees came 45 minutes later and the appetizer came after that with the nachos dried out and cold from sitting Will not go backService was pretty good Food was good Just wish appetizer was brought out before the actual entrees Others or good experience with a good atmosphere Thank youThis is a quite promising venue   I think its new enough that theyre still getting into the swing of things  I think there was a miscommunication between the hostess and server  After being seated we waited about 15 minutes before flagging somebody down as we hadnt even been served water yet  Our server was very apologetic about the mixup and took some off of the tab to make up for it which was quite niceA few tips for the owner:  The upstairs is pretty loud  There are a couple of small black soundabsorbing blocks but they need much more  Window treatments would do wonders to help but I still think itd need more  I got the city chicken sandwich which was good  But was lacking in dimension a bit  I think mostly because it had no sauce   I think it was supposed to have a mustard sauce  I was thinking that something sour andor spicy would go great with the cutlet  My girlfriend got the pork chop which was tasty  But she had mentioned that shed have preferred a doublecut chop as opposed to two singles  The apple brine was good but not very noticeable  If the apple brine is intended to be a focus then maybe some apple slices w cinnamon on top as a garnish would really bring it homeIts currently got some growing pains it seems  But well definitely be returning to see how it goesFor a casual relaxed atmosphere great food and friendly folks this is the place  The 3 guys that own it are always there to say Hi and the wings are the best I have ever tasted My husband had the turkey club and it was fabulous  And oh by the way great choices in beer  A vintage decor complete with tin ceiling and gorgeous wooden bar set the tone for a fun evening  Karen BLove the old school feel the place ia drafty and was chilly so we moved up stairs Staff was great and attentive place was clean Food was good the bacon appetizers were burning my mouth but I just kept eating it was so good My fish sandwich was good but a bit greasy But the french fries are to die for if in the area we definitely will go back Would have liked to see more on tap specifically more local brews we have many around to choose from"

    "review":"I go here probably two to five times a month and I love it every time My boyfriend lives two blocks down so pretty much everytime we are on a walk I make him stop for at least a macaron So I have probably tried 50 of the desserts and 25 of the macarons My favorites are the pistachio cappuccino and nutella macarons I really like the opera cake and the Parisbrest desserts If you are in squirrel hill you must stop by its so deliciousI got the raspberry and white chocolate basil macarons 225 each The raspberry was great but not any better than the 175 raspberry macarons I have had before DO NOT GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE BASIL I was trying to be adventurous with this flavor pick and it totally backfired White chocolate and basil are not meant to be together and I am a lover of both Overall I probably would not recommend because of the priceEverything Ive had from Gaby Et Jules is fantastic From their macarons to their lemon tartalette to their croissants and pains au chocolate everything is delicious and flawlessly executed The folks at the counter are also very courteous and the decor is beautiful A wonderful addition to Squirrel HillBest macarons in Pittsburgh Actually best macarons Ive tried so far in the whole countryGreat ambiance  beautiful decor gorgeous pastries great staff and sparkling clean Our favorite desert today was the Pina Colada My favorite desert place Worth the drive from the South HillsAs soon as my mom and I walked in we were greeted by a cheery Bonjour The shop is clean and bright We were overwhelmed by the number of different pastries and had trouble choosng just one to share wed just had a very filling dinner One of the girls behind the counter was extremely patient and helpful as we tried to chooseWe ended up with Le croustillant aux 3 chocolats and enjoyed it a lot The chocolate was rich and delicious and the presentation was great The outdoor seating was a great place to enjoy dessert on a warm evening Unfortunately the price here is not something a college student can afford daily but Ill definitely remember this place for a treat in the future"

    "review":"Awesome local Italian restaurant  Great food and even better staff did exactly what all the other reviews said and were friendly and easy to talk withA little pricey but what Italian restaurant is notThanks YELPTCThe service is spotty  Water and bread appeared shortly after we were seated  But we waited for more than 5 minutes before the waitress asked for drink orders  The food is good not outstanding  I ordered a vodka martini  I was charged extra for the brand of vodka I requested which can be standard for some restaurants but I was really annoyed to pay 250 for blue cheese olives  I have ordered martinis in many restaurants Pittsburgh as well as other cities and have never been charged for blue cheese olives  Little extras like cheese on your salad blue cheese olives etc should be built into the cost of the entree  I really hate to be nickeled and dimedScoglio continues to be one of the finest restaurants in the area which I enjoy often but I have a bone to pick with it  Unlike restaurants like Atrias Scoglio offers specials whose prices are kept secret until one receives the check  Not announcing the prices places the diner in the awkward position of having to ask which is uncomfortable  Diners would not order from a menu that did not include prices so why should the tariff for specials be kept under wraps  On my most recent visit the special ordered by my wife was a whopping 34 3 more than the most expensive item on the regular menu an unpleasant surpriseGreat food fast service  Best Italian soon I the west end I have ordered their fries zucchini and fried calamari both of which are unmatched in Pittsburgh Their salads awesome also Definitely a great place to eatGreat service Always willing to go above and beyond to help their guests Food is amazing and quick Great place for business meetings Very great dining experience80s is right and full of suits on lunch break That said it was good service and I was in and out in about 50 minutes I would come here again"

    "review":"This is the spot you hit before you go to Heinz hall for the symphony  Ive only ever eaten one entree here but thats only because I kept getting it every time I came here  I forget the name but its trout thats stuffed with lump crabmeat on one side oysters Rockafeller on the other and all topped off with a white wine cream sauce  That plus 2 glasses of wine and you may fall asleep during your RachmanonovI recently went here with a group of friends The atmosphere feels like somewhere you would go with your grandparents and hasnt been updated in 20 years The waitress was very kind at first and gladly offered to do separate checks At the end of our dinner she gave us separate checks with an attitude and said she would never do that again Well why did you gladly offer in the first place I felt like our presence their was an annoyance to the employees which made a bad experience for me I got the Chicken Romano and it was the worst chicken Ive had in a very long time It had no flavor and tasted like they took chicken breast put flour on it and fried it without a single seasoning The green beans I got were hard and half were overgrown with the pods popping out I understand youre going to pay higher prices downtown but for 1999 I couldve gone to KFC and had a better experience and better meal It was so bland and gross that I couldnt finish the chicken and I went to McDonalds after and I wont be going backVery unfriendly hostess  Tables are placed too close together  They really cram people in like sardines before shows  Food isnt memorable in fact downright horrible at times  Ive had to endure this place on several occasions for work lunches and friends whove wanted to try it before seeing a show  From the outside it looks like a great bustling place but once youre in and seated you quickly regret itWhere do I start Well there is good and notsogood at Bravo Franco RistoranteThe location is perfectly situated in the cultural district and very convenient They seem to have squeezed in as many tables as is physically possible so it is cramped and noisy The tables on either side of us were so close that waitress couldnt get to them and was passing food around Normalsized people had difficulty passing tables to head to the restroom The decor is a bit dated and it has an oldschool feel to it but that is not a big deal  Two stars for the restaurantThe service Well first is that they take your coat whether you want them to or not Our waitress was a bit grumpy impatient and seemed like she really needed a change of career She was almost combative when the wife asked about which she could eat with her gluten allergy and it was only when she handed me the check that she made an effort to be friendly She also kept putting her hand on my shoulder and calling me hon which seemed really awkward being that she was so grumpy They seemed a bit understaffed  Two stars for serviceNow to the food There were a lot of selections although none were vegetarian The salad greens were perfect and the clam chowder was well prepared and not overly salty as is common at many places My linguini with red clam sauce was wonderful but a bit overpriced at 1895 The wife had glutenfree pasta with tomato basil sauce and despite the difficulties with the ordering gluten free food she was pleased with the dish The homemade tiramisu worked and the coffee was  a nice mild Italian roast Allinall the food was 4 starsI would not go to this restaurant if you want to be able to carry on a conversation have food allergies are claustrophobic have small children or are on a tight budget But if you have tickets to a nearby show and want some good Italian food this might be a good choiceWhile the location of this restaurant is superb the food is pretty good and the service averageI saw Wicked at the Benedum and we ate here first It was about 5 degrees outside  when we got there and they make you take you coat off at the door We stood by the door waiting for our table with door opening and closing for people arriving Tables are really tight If you dont speak really really softly tables nearby can hear you Young girl beside me was texting and I could have read her texts if I wanted tooChicken Piccatta was very good Veal special was equally good House salad dressing was described to me by the waiter as  a balsamic vinegrette with dry bleu cheese crumbles Perfect for me and my guest When the bill came they charged us 150 each for dry bleu I always order dry bleu and I always pay extra for it with no problem But he described it as part of the dressing and that bugs me So if I had ordered the Sundried tomato dressing on my salad would I have been charged extra for sundried tomatoesAll in all a decent place to eat before a show simply for the convenience But there are many places to choose from and I will try somewhere else next timeThe food is overpriced for what they give you one chicken breast and a spear of broccoli was 2250 Talk about making a come up Not to mention it wasnt seasoned very well  The interior of the restaurant looks very dated The only positive was that we were pressed for time and our waiter was able to accommodate Not worth it I would rather wait for a table next door at Meat and Potatoes than return here even if they are the only place with open tables which was the case tonight"

    "review":"Ill keep this short and sweet Best fish sandwhich in pittsburgh one of the best Ive had anywhere in the country the large is the size of a football try itIt was very tasty and the people were nice Buy I just feel it was overpriced for what I got I only got two fish filets and hush puppies and it was 12 dollars But it was good so give it a try I might go back and maybe go for a meal that might be more worth the buckI adore this place Having grown up in the south this place gives a nice spin on my favorite foods It is a little on the expensive side but the portions are generousOk so I went back again and got the tilapia dinner for 10 bucks Soooo good and worth every penny Get the tilapia dinner and thank me laterIm a local so I suppose Im a little partial for neighborhood businesses but Pittsburgh Fish  Chicken is certainly a great option if you live in Brighton Heights or youre just passing through after work with a hankering for fried  Youre mainly going to find all things fried with the exception of a few individually packaged desserts and waffles which accompany the Chicken  Waffles dinner special but fried is what they do well here  with a mildly spicy lemony dusting of their signature spice blend  Avoid the fries unfortunately they are not freshcut and the sandwich version of any of their fried offerings the buns and accoutrements are second rate  Yes the place is a little shabby looking but the cooks are friendly enough and lord knows we need more local business and dinning options in particular in our proud neighborhood  Try the ocean perch catfish or the chicken tenders which are surprisingly awesome even for an adult palate  The best bet is to order ahead and have your fried feast waiting for youGreat to see so many seafood options available especially in this area Its title is clear as to what you can find And yes all of it is fried I asked But better to feed your gluttonous blerp here than at a conglomo Looks like they are set up for pick up orders mostly but it is a great place to find lunch They sell wings in quantities if 150 pcs And they fry fresh It didnt smell like brunt oil and the place is clean Employees are friendly and local I had the smelt with fries and potato salad Very home style delicious The fries are crispy and steamy hot so be careful The smelt was just a bit chewy but they were small fillets Also sodium intake is a bit high if you are trying to stay away from it In conclusiongo here"

    "review":"So cheap and big portions The service is friendly and fun their familyowned atmosphere makes you feel as though they are rally taking care of youThe food is good fresh and fillingI recommend their version PhoA mustvisit for late night carousers from out of town or anyone looking for non American fare after drinking on Carson We were in town for Bears Steelers and ended up looking for action on this side of town after downtown deflated due to Bears crushing victory Whether due to the game or earlier revelry for the Pirates clinching the playoffs Carson was pretty low key so we decided to end the night eating rather than drinkingThe food was good and the owner definitely took pride in the preparation a la Muhammad Ali He actually told me itd be the best soup broth Id ever had which made me wonder whether people I cook for feel the same way when I tout my own abilities In short it wasnt the best but it was good I felt bad not finishing it because he was so damn excited about it but i dug the commitment and self promotion Having been to southeast Asia and living in a city with many southeast Asian options I was surprised I was as satisfied as I was The wontons were also good but Id stick with VietnameseCambodian options based on our samplePretty sure this place has the biggest bathroom door do not steal me key chain Ive ever seen Really wish I would have explored that with the owner I can only imagine what frisat late night madness led to that security measure Maybe drunks were stealing some of that expensive toilet paper referenced in their signageThe food was amazing and I highly recommend it One of the best meals Ive ever eaten and Ive travelled to 26 countries and 20 states Highly recommend crispy noodles fish wontons and egg rolls with moon sauce I may have to drive from Florida to Pittsburgh again to get 2ndsCambodIcan Kitchen is the spot if youre looking for lots of cheap food served at all hours of the night However if you prefer a restaurant where the tables arent sticky to the touch an owner who wears a clean shirt or where you dont need a key for the bathroom this isnt your spotI can appreciate a quality dive joint Theres a certain charm to an establishment that has great food and a lot of character stemming from the food the decor or the staff CambodIcan Kitchen is certainly a dive but it doesnt really have the character Im looking for now that Im in my midthirties When my girlfriend and I entered we were greeted at the counter by the burly owner handing us menus and barking Read to each of us I kind of figured that he was going for funny with this greeting but he was gruff enough that it took some further interaction with him to confirm that he was just being a goofball After ordering and sitting down at the table in the front of the restaurant where the owner recommended we were surprised at how sticky the table and everything else on it was The owner also proudly told us about the dried roasted red pepper topping that all tables had which I found to be very tasty The little jar they were in was very sticky I tried not to think about how long it had been since it was probably cleanedWe were pretty hungry and ordered the appetizer sampler as well as chicken thigh fried rice and pork noodle soup The appetizer sampler platter was huge just a mountain of fried food The egg rolls were average and the grilled chicken was decent although a bit on the dry side A lot of the items on the platter were covered in their signature moon sauce which was way too sweet for my taste but if sweet sauces are your thing youll probably love itThe chicken thigh fried rice was solid as fried rices go but not good enough for me to venture back The pork noodle soup didnt have much flavor to it and the noodles were very much overcooked CambodIcan Kitchen is an interesting cashonly place thats open all night long run by an irreverent offkilter owner I enjoyed and admired his passion but wasnt into his brand of humor his diatribes were quite frequent when we were there I suppose that working at a restaurant at odd hours of the night for years and dealing with drunk patrons can do that thoughIf youre looking for food that is authentic healthy or really tasty I would keep looking However if you want a huge quantity of food thats ok really sweet cheap and dont mind an owner who could be a wacky sitcom character you have your spotThe only thing better than the food is the service The server gave very detailed information about the food and made sure that we got exactly what we were looking for I highly recommend the seafood wontons as well as the vegetable curry bowl It was somehow better than Thai curry which I had thought was my favorite If you get the wontons and you like spicy food I recommend asking for their pickled Thai chilies which they grow organically and pickle in houseThe food is pretty good We shared beef wontons which were the best part along with the chicken kabob The kabob was massive so I would highly recommend sharing The menu is a bit limited The staff are friendly The down side to this place is that this place looks filthy From the floors to the walls it makes you feel a bit uneasy There is a strange entertainment center along one of the walls You also have to take a 3 foot pipe or wooden post as a bathroom key I dont think Ill dine in again but Id give it a chance as take away Although they really need to clean up the place for me to want to go regularly The food is good but they are losing points for the state of the place"

    "review":"The neighborhood of Highland Park welcomes its newest addition to Restaurant Row on Bryant StreetVery friendly chef and decent Japanese food  Even better than some places in Japan when I was there The wait is long but its definitely worth it Location is in the quiet neighborhood so the parking was quite easy Strongly recommend itI am going to go ahead and give this place a full four stars even though I dont like those japanese pancakes that this place is known for These stars go for the takoyaki which was as good as the dish in japan and is exceedingly rare on American Japanese menus The stars also go for the silken Tofu which was also as good as restaurants in Japan This place is as authentic as it gets outside of Japan and serves traditional homestyle food There is no americanization and we even sat on the floor with our shoes off As it should be As it should beAfter multiple visits to Teppanyaki I am impressed with their careful clean preparation of wholesome food My favorite dishes are the special okonomiyaki pancakes featuring softened cabbage spicy mayo and amazing barbeque sauce and the baconwrapped mochi though I would not label this wholesome it is a delightfully chewy rice pillow wrapped in bacon with a rich sweet salty glaze Many of their seasonal specials have been equally delicious and this place is a haven for vegetarians ExcellentI LOVED this place It was my first experience with authentic Japanese cuisine and I was blown away How I had never heard of this place is a mystery since I live just blocks away I had the tofu and mushroom stake and a plate of ramen noodles The flavor was so light and savory and the texture of the tofu was so smooth It was like butta Do not be fooled These ramen noodles are not the noodles of your college years but their grown up sophisticated and super tasty cousin Prices where very reasonable and the atmosphere very welcoming My party of four had no idea how to navigate a Japanese menu but our server was patient and happy to answer our newbie questions I will certainly go backDefinitely a unique experience A different authentic style Japanese restaurant Most dishes will not be seen at other places in Pittsburgh fried mochi wrapped in bacon Would recommend to try once for the food but the service was some of the worst ever"

    "review":"Typical neighborhood pizza place but it does the job Its a cute little shop with sidewalk seating and ice cream window in the summer The inside isnt anything special but it seems clean The staff is busy but not unfriendly Usually though we order delivery It comes within the normal amount of time and the pizza is goodBelieve it or not the best thing about Cestones is their ice cream which like Darren said resembles a mousse in taste and texture Its really thick and holds up well in the heat The pizza was pretty good My burger was a little dry though The regulars are nebby as Pittsburghers say but are niceI could talk about how great this place is for hours but Ill keep it relatively short for those of you rushing to find a good place to eat Im a regular and Ive had it all This pizza has a perfectly crafted crispysoft crust and tastes amazing The ice cream is amazing as other reviews have mentioned get a chocolate milkshake Great hoagies steak or hot sausage are the best They also have gyros fries chicken salads and burgers so something for every mood But the best part of this place is that its a great place to hang out and drink a beer with friends in one of Pittsburghs most charming neighborhoodsReally solid small town pizza place Really inexpensive and great bang for your buck Me and my family were visiting Pittsburgh for the night and stopped in for a quick bite before taking a ride on the Duquesne incline The crust was incredible and the toppings were really tasty Great beer selection with tons of local options as well as some importsNot a place to go if your looking for a classy evening but great if youre looking to grab a quick bite to eatThis is my favorite place to eat pizza in Pittsburgh A great neighborhood pizzeria that also has reasonably priced beer ready and cooled in the fridge I really like the quality of their vegetables especially the spinach They also put fresh minced garlic on the pizza which is a mustgetIn addition the staff is awesome and is a great staple of the neighborhood In my last time visiting the restaurant I saw the workers take in a kid who had been left alone and was lost at the bus stop after school They gave him a free soda small pizza and put cartoons on the television while contacting the childs mother and watching him until she got thereNot only is this place a great restaurant but a positive impact to my community Love this placeJonesing for a slice away from home I came across this family owned local gem Reminded me of the neighborhood pizzerias in Brooklyn where I grew up that are now laden in granite and marble like a mausoleum what a shame Anyway tasty crispy pepperoni slice especially for Pittsburgh They cut them in half here so it feels like 2 only they charge you for 1 Nice Had the Cherokee cherry soda and a superman ice cream All that for less than 5 bux Maddone Whats a superman ice cream I dunno but it was good"

    "review":"The Best Pizza and Hoagies  Lots of places closer but we travel to get the bestBest Pizza Their hoagies are pretty great too My only complaint about Sunseris is that they dont take credit cardsGreat hidden secret is Baldwin Moved here 3 years ago got pizza hoagies and fried apps for my friends and family who helped us move Everyone loved the food Now three years later my wife and I order from there at least once a month Great delivery service for a small charge but well worth the service Only down fall is the phone line gets backed up from time to timeAwesome Italian hoagie If youre a fan of Dannys in the south hillsthis is betterMy wife has been gifted the heavenly goodness that are the breadsticks from Sunseri and she said they were incredible insisting we try the place Now Ive seen this place when I passed through the neighborhood before and thought thats the kind of place that would either be really good or the kind of place you get food poisoning I never tried the it since theyre about 20 minutes away and in what seems like it could be a shady neighborhoodsorry if your a local Well she talked me into it last night and I have to admit I should have tried it back when I saw it the first time We ordered the normal lets try this place large pepperoni and the breadsticks that Ive heard so much about When I got there I was pleasantly surprised by how clean it was After the ride back home we got down to business the breadsticks which are the most unique Ive seen and Ive probably eaten more pizza than any other human were just as good as she said and worth the 40 minute round trip The pizza was also really good cooked not too crispy but done all the way through I will absolutely go back to this place probably enough to put the owners children through college I would recommend this place to anyone interested in stuffing themselves full of tasty goodness and not spending a ton of loot I spent under 20 The only thing that could be an issue is they only take cashFamily owned pizza shop thats a favorite for those in the south hills of Pittsburgh The cheese blend is in my opinion what makes their pizza stand above the rest in the area Great subs as well Would definitely recommend ordering for pick up as delivery can be slow depending on the night"

    "review":"Wow  I cant believe I am the first person to review Bite and Brews  which is a great little place located next to the ever popular Elbow Room  One of the biggest reasons to go here is that they have wheat crust pizza  They also put this amazing seasoning on the crust  You can order a whole pizza or just a slice and they have lots of toppings to choose from  I like that the pizza is not greasy  The side salad is huge the pizza slices are huge  The bar has an extensive draft list  Bites and Brews isnt fancy but it is nicer than a dive bar  I think the price is right too  The front door is garage door style so when the weather is nice the door is open and you can sit outside or just outsideYou go to Bites and Brews for Beer and Pizza  They also sport quite a few TVs tuned to sports channels but I wouldnt necessarily call it a sports bar  The main attraction for me is that they always have one microbrew that is 3 and that the menu is designed for you to craft your own pizza  The pizzas have a doughy crust and crumbs on the bottom which I go back and forth about liking but on the whole they are well made and always hit the spot  A great place for a night out with friends and just as good for take out  My goto pizza in Shadyside any day1 They have very good pizza  The pizzas are large delicious and reheat well you will have leftovers if you get a large for 2 people2 They have a great beer list though it seems like they are always out of whatever I want  A lot of craft beer on tap and a lot more in bottles  Excellent3 The service is usually pretty good and its a fun place to go with a few friendsIve never tried a sandwich or anything but their pizza but then again why would I  If it wasnt for the debacle that is parking on or near Ellsworth on a weekend night Id go here more regularlyThis is a favorite neighborhood spotespecially for half price pizza and dollar off drafts I used to live around the corner and loved sitting outside with the dogs on weekend evenings with good friends pizza and beer I think the pizzas have gotten smaller over the past year or so but are still a great deal when half off  The draft list is hit or miss sometimes they are out of a lot of great brews which can be upsetting but other times they have an endless selectionThe servers have all been pretty nice to my friends and I who would tend to come in large groups with people coming and going and everyone has always been accommodating Especially to my dogPretty underwhelmed Interior is dingy and poorly lit The music playing at an uncomfortable volume seems to be straight from the soundtrack of the Scooby Doo movie I have no nostalgia for Fly by Sugar Ray And while the beer list is impressive they were out of what I wanted and I had to settle for a second choice Worst of all was the food I got a chicken sandwich that turned out to be a tasteless chunk of chicken settled uncomfortably between two pieces of bread I know I shouldnt expect much from a dive bar but for 8 it should be better than a frozen supermarket sandwich Cant really think of anything good to say Overpriced and terrible And with so many bars on the same block theres no reason to settle for Bites and BrewsWe chose Bites and Brews because of the many good online reviews especially the pizza  While the pizza turned out to be among the best Ive had in the burgh the beer list bottle n tap had a pretty solid variety  We just made it in for the happy hour prices  The best part was the service as our server ably provided several suggestions based on our preferences  Its now my favorite place for good pizza and a great beer  Ill definitely need to try to some of the other pizza varieties  There seemed to be plenty of onstreet parking"

    "review":"Definitely worth a tryVery cleanVery friendly staffNice alternative to the fast food your usually stuck eating downtownIts always exciting to see yet another mediterranean takeout place open up downtown Between Madonnas Istanbul Grills two locations Palmyra Shabs Christos and Alihans you could eat tabbouleh for lunch every day of the week without visiting the same place twiceShabs is definitely a solid option for a quick bite to eat They focus on the usual middleeastern fast food options including pita strollers small pita sandwiches hummus tabbouleh falafel etc While theyre not the best mediterranean option downtown the food is always tasty affordable and served quicklyOne unique aspect of Shabs I appreciate is that theyve organized their menu to accommodate healthconscious customers with calorie counts listed for all the menu itemsExcellent falafel sandwich made with fresh ingredients and not oldgrease  It might cost a bit more than a street food truck but this is very healthy and clean  Definitely a good food source for downtown lunchI have to give 4 stars bc of the service The staff is very welcoming Otherwise probably a 3 for now The cucumber sauce is really good Tom and Jerry special was a great blend of flavors The feta really made the tabbooli pop with flavor It comes with a pita I put pieces of gyro covered in hot sauce along with the tabbooli Mediterranean and Tzatziki Sauce on the pita which was dripping from the bottom with juices The strollers are great You literally can stroll down the street and eat it by how its nicely wrapped The gyro stroller was ok Just slightly on the dry side With more sauce it would of been satisfyable The grape leaves werent marinated enough and lacked the lemon flavor The hommous was the same way They make it fresh everyday so maybe it was just today The other things didnt taste as good today Overall enjoyable  Will definitely go back With all of the different combinations customizable options including the implied openness to customize the wall of fame I would suggest this placeShabs a relatively new place that opened up on Forbes boast a Delicious  Nutritious alternative to the downtown lunch scene Its Mediterranean fare including pitas gyros strollers falafels lentil soup and salads They seem to pride themselves on heart healthy low carb low fat meals and they even have the calorie count on the menu behind the counter Although they offer catering and delivery the restaurant itself has a bit of a fast food feel to it Its well lit and theres plenty of seating but the plastic utensils that they provide are really pretty chinsey This being my first time here I choose the classic gyro platter with green beans I placed my order with the gentleman behind the register and he gave me a number informing me that I could pick up my meal at the end of the counter It didnt take long for me to hear my number  I was given a tray with a disposable tin bowl containing a generous portion of rice under thick cuts of gyro meat a pita and the green beans were swimming in a stewed tomato dressing It was actually pretty tasty and I left feeling full without bloated Cost out the door was just a little over 900Overall I wouldnt tell you to stay away and Ill most likely be back But on the other hand I wouldnt put it on my must try list either It is however a nice alternative to the elephant scab on a bun lunch that youll find in so many fast food jointsShabs is my new favorite lunch spot downtown While not always home to a perfect meal they do hit a lot of the items on my personal checklist for fast reasonable lunch spots Plus the wait for food here is about a quarter of the time Ive spent at other eateries that specialize in healthier meals  which is pretty big perk I have to sayThe menu at Shabs isnt the longest and when you walk in its clear that this place is meant to be a fast stop the seats and tables remind me of a cafeteria and there isnt much in the way of welcoming decor But it is a bright and clean place They also routinely hand out brochures and flyers that list their meals and calorie counts in plain sight  which is more convenient than going online and navigating through a website or Googling to find nutrition info on what I want to eat Fast healthy food to go Ill sacrifice cute decor for thatThe food itself is generally tasty too with options ranging from just salads to platter plates with meat rice and vegetables to gyros and pita wraps However I do have one complaint about the food they serve: they microwave some of it I mean you can see them do it as you wait for your order As a result every piece of meat Ive eaten here is bone dry  hence my lessthanfivestar ratingFortunately for Shabs I like eating here because they aim to serve healthy dishes overall and they do serve fresh vegetables even more fortunately when you slather any meat in the sauces that come with your meals it helps to mask the dry parts of your meal If nothing else I always have the option of bringing some juicer cuts of meat to work myself and just getting my salad at Shabs And since its quicker to grab a fast healthy meal here than many other places near my office Shabs for the most part is more than a satisfying lunch option in my book"

    "review":"Underwhelming by a mile Probably the worst wait and food weve had in a while Italian festival  We chose here Every street vender had better tasting food served at least 20 degrees warmer and offered friendlier service Try the tiramisu I guess It was the only acceptable item the three of us had and thats because it was supposed to be cold Pass this placeThe food here is great Small casual and seems to be the best kept secret for lunch Moderate prices not a cheap lunch but very fresh and tasty Try the pepito and the fried provolone YUMsigh I dont even know where to begin with Adolfosnothing was good about this place First off what is the deal with them being a Venezuelan and Italian restaurant Just because your restaurant is located in a primarily Italian neighborhood doesnt mean you have to also serve Italian food Pick one style and be the master of that style food I would have more respect for them if they just stuck to what they know and only served Venezuelan food The menu is SO small and there are barely any vegetarian options My husband and I looked at the menu for about 15 minutes trying to figure out what to order we didnt want to order pasta we wanted to try a Venezuelan entree but due to no vegetarian options we had to order a pasta dish Honestly we were a few seconds away from walking out but didnt want to cause a scene figured were already there mise well try something Started with the onion soup and fried plantains The soup was so so but really oily with a big lump of cheese in it which was really chewy and the plantains had a bunch of cheese dumped on top of them and were so greasy and mushy The entree came with a small salad No thought put into the salad Cheap lettuce and the veggies were not even diced the tomato was hard and the dressing choices were so basic We split the pesto pastanot good Barely ate it Once again too oilygreasy too much cheese and a generic flavorAlso the prices are much too high Almost 30 for a fish entree that comes with just one small basic side I almost ordered the fish entree but I wasnt about to pay almost 30 Thats ridiculous I really dont understand how Adolfos has so many 5 star reviews I was so disappointed and felt like I wasted my money on my meal This was a complete miss for meThis is a tough restaurant to rate I wanted to like the restaurant: I felt that the staff was extremely sweet and the chef was obviously passionate about his menu However I was not blown away by the food The salad was a simple side salad: lettuce tomatoes cucumber olives Not particularly specialFor the main course I felt the flavors were not extremely diverse or complex The food was reminiscent of home cooking It was well done but I found the pricing to be pretty high for the quality and amount of food The fusion part was more that there were some Venezuelan dishes and some Italian dishes Perhaps that fact made some lack of cohesiveness of the whole restaurant The salad didnt quite work with the dish I got The dish I got was a Venezuelan dish: fried pork and a side of rice While the pork was delicious and rice well cooked I felt it lacked any variation Perhaps if I had gotten a Venezuelan vegetable side dish my view of the whole meal might have changedOverall the food was okay and the people were great I may come back for a takeout option instead of a sitdown in the futureFound this hidden gem one afternoon walking through Bloomfield with my dog  The dogfriendly patio made having lunch comfortable and enjoyable  The patio itself was ideally located with plenty of shade  Our waitress was very accommodating and pleasant  The food came out quickly delicious and reasonably priced  If youre in the Bloomfield area this place and its patio are a definite stop  Bonusits BYOBAdolfos is just ok in my book  I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation especially for dinner on the weekend as I saw many people being turned away  Our waitress was very nice and attentive  I ordered the veal parm with a side of pasta and chicken pastina soup  The soup was good but it was served barely warm btw I was starving so I just ate it at that temperature I survived  The veal was HUGE the size of a small pizza huge three people could have shared it and left full  It just didnt have that much taste to it and it wasnt anything special The side of pasta was your basic penne and marinara but it was very small and didnt match the size of the parm  I think you only get the complimentary sangria if you are not BYOBing my friends brought wine and I didnt drink any nor was I offered sangria  I dont think I would go here again"

    "review":"As far as Wendys go its middle of the pack They get the order wrong by at least a little bit 13 of the time And calling it fast food is kind of comical But if youre in Wilkinsburgwell this place is in Wilkinsburg also Thats about the best I can say Oh and everyone is generally polite here So theyve got that going for themFirst let me say that Ive never stepped foot in this location and plan on keeping it that way  Im not one for eating alone in a restaurant so I usually use the drive thruBeing on Penn Ave in the Point BreezeWilkinsburg its a little tricky to get in and out of this location  The wait at the drive thru is usually minimal which is unheard of for drive thrus anywhere  The staff are polite  The food is typical for fast food burger placesThis is definitely a below average Wendys although as other have mentioned your options are limited in this area and this is probably your best bet  I have experienced long delays here in the drive through 20 minutes with 5 cars in frort of me to start  My order has ultimately been accurately filled though  The food is normal Wendys fareThe interior is fine and can get busy at lunchtime  It is not especially clean but not egregiously dirty either On the low end of normal I have never felt unsafe hereThis place claims it is open until 2am but it never is  3 times in the last month Ive tried to go here later on at night and they havent been open one time Last night I went here at 11pm when they were supposed to be open until 2am according to the hours on their building and online and still they were closed Anyway if I wanted to go somewhere to get food during the day Id never go here and apparently at night when other things arent open I still cant go here because they close hours before they claim they close Its also a violation of trust they do this too Anyway from now on if I want to go to Wendys I will just have to drive a few miles to go to the next closest one because this one does not have its stuff togetherThis has got to be the worst fcking Wendys I have ever been to They piss me off every time They always gets orders wrong Food is not fresh and hot I would not go there for months and the service is terrible every time The staff do not greet customers They do not keep the dining room clean They frequently run out of condiments and or napkins for the dining area I would have to say I have received the worst service from there consistently They just revamped the interior but the service and employees are still terrible"

    "review":"Two meals on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place and after the second trip I was compelled to write Rocky would definitely describe the experiencesOn the first trip I went to try their at that timeraved about Reuben And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh I tried itWell they were out of the proper bread and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find which was not the proper bread and instead of one of their raved about Reubens I received two miniReubens which basically took the guts from one Reuben and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread I ate it It wasnt great but they swore it was because theyd run out of the bread Bread or not it still wasnt great The atmosphere was pleasant in that blue collar bar kind of way and the staff was very nice but not a winning pitch on the ReubenThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend Sat in the back room instead of the bar which felt more like a restaurant of course with the big screen TV covering the sports of the momentI was in the mood for dinner this time and after a scan decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar My friend ordered one of her faves the breaded pork chopsWe hit the salad bar which was uberbasic Three soups mostly vegetable loaded which left me out basic iceberg lettuce mix very probably out of a bag a few veggie toppings and three or four dressings It was a basic salad no big deal More or less an appetizer filler before the mealThe mindblower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face and an air of vapidity which was confirmed when I placed my order I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to ask and the child honestly had no clue what white meat and dark meat meant The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a preportioned prepared bag kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken stylewhich didnt answer my question thus prompting the second trip After the second trip back I heard the cook holler Tell him Ill fix him up Well the chicken was prepackaged dreck like youd find in the freezer case of Walmart tiny and not good and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chemspuds flavor laden with some kind of chopped up green parsley and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon bucketsThank goodness for the basic salad barEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what shed expected They also appeared to be from a freezer bagThe irony was that the boy who didnt know white meat from dark meat was chatting with some other customersabout baseballand he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball Ahhhh da burghThird base Nahwhy bother when there are so many other options around Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegiethey can help you out all types of ways in that area Just dont go hungry if you actually have tastebudsFrom what I understand it used to be really good homecooked food But apparently mama has left the kitchenThis place is dirty and smells food is reely bad I took it home and feed it to the dog Hope he dont get sick from the food like I didIf you are searching for a go to fish place for Lentlook no further  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seatingEnjoyThis is a great little gem  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice barpublounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rockys  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table It was clean welcoming and the lounge was busy It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew  The order was delivered to my table in no time  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake  Another good choice  At the end of night the Penguins couldnt pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new go to when Im in town  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment  I dont smoke but I understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who doRockys has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong  Their food is good  Not haute cuisine pretentious  Everyday well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking  Ive mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room but today I introduced an old friend to linner in the barHe ordered the large version of fish sandwich  Rockys is famous for their fish  Three large breaded and fried fish filets bun and fries for under 10  Needless to say he had no complaints and brought home more than he ateI ordered the meatball grill  It was delish  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made grilled cheese mozzarella style  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good  Also served with fries  I brought home half the sandwichAnother good meal there  Friends mother and former boss all enjoy their foodGreat local bar Theresa does a great job Sandwiches are excellent Recommend meatball reuben burger fish sandwiches"

    "review":"Came here for lunch  Got a chili dog and bacon cheeseburger for less than 5  Not bad for the price  It is a small place  However dont expect muchThree of us walked in and sat the bar  Both the ladies working there looked up then went back to what theyre doing  One was on her phone the entire time and was forgetting customer orders left and rightThe beef patties were frozen they use american cheese fake cheese and white buns  They basically cooked a fast food joint burger which is expected for the price  The chili dog was decent  Chili tasted good as well as the dogOverall it is cheap eats  I cant say the food was amazing but for the money it is ok  Id say it is about the quality of a fast food joint just a little bit better prepared  I do not like the idea that their cup of water came from the same faucet where they wash their hands thoughWhen you go into this place you must be patient  Chances are that you are going to have to wait to get your meal  The place often gets very crowded and you always meet new people to talk to which makes the time goes by quickly     I always feel more welcome by the customer including the ones I never met before than I do with staff there  The food is reasonably pricedIm becoming a regular here for breakfast Its a great little dive diner with limited menu and open concept grillseating at the counter Definitely a Bloomfield thing with the regulars that seem to know everyone and welcome everyone and the staff knows everyone by name kinda like Cheers but not a bar Its rare that you wait for your food and its always quite tasty and CHEAP and not the kind of cheap that would send you across the street to the hospital the delicious full happy stomach kind of cheapI have been passing by this little greasy spoon dive diner for some time I decided one Saturday that I needed to stop in and try it out There is not a lot of seating present and you can tell most of the patrons are regulars We found one table open and sat ourselves The cookhostessserverbusser was with us in moments of being seated and taking our order We both decided on the 2 egg breakfast with water and she was gone instantaneously It was amazing how ephemeral she was in her movements and appeared as though she was in multiple places from timetotime an obvious benefit of working in such a small diner coupled with years of experienceOur drinks and food were quick to come out and nothing looked out of place Nothing that we ate would ever be considered gastronomy but it was all tasty and cooked properly The real shock was the price tag I dont know that I could cook breakfast for that low a price I will definitely return when I want a quick breakfast"

    "review":"We stopped by last Saturday night for dinner  While the two of us got the last booth in the bar area others were waiting 40 minutes for a table for four  The bar was very noisy and crowded with patrons who appeared in their late 50s and early 60s Our server had trouble getting through the crowd to take our orders and deliver our food My wife ordered the ham and lima bean soup very good I had a house salad great  the greens were very very fresh and the dressing homemade We ordered sandwiches pretty good and split a toasted almond cake for dessert good  Dont expect anything on the culinary cutting edge  this is a Pittsburgh redsauce Italian place and they do it pretty goodLove this place Ive tried different things on the menu and no complaints here Very good foodThis place was quiet The service was promptwaitress was nicelarge food selection So many chickenItalian dishes It was difficult to choose I had the Chicken milanese A chicken dish that had a wine and lemon sauce My husband had a monster hoagie Both meals were very tasteful I definately will be back to try more Italian dishesI have eaten here several times for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed  The shrimp scampi is amazing calzones are huge and delicious  Love it hereDespite living in the area for many years this was my first time at the restaurant  I will be back  The main attraction is the food which is superb  I ordered a fried zucchini appetizer and a cheesy meatball pizza  Both were absolutely delicious The salads and calzones looked great as well  Prices are fair for the quality and the quantity of the food 595 for seven nicesized planks of fried zucchini is a bargain in Pittsburgh  My twelve slice pizza was 1295 plus 200 for meatball topping: no complaint  I did not have bread but it looked fresh and tasty Service from Megan was pleasant and generally efficient  She made me feel welcome and she warmly said the magic words thank you at the end of the meal which regrettably is increasingly rare  There was no quality check from anyone although the hostess went over to a group of men sitting adjacent to me to ensure their satisfaction  Only after I had waited more than ten minutes for the appetizer was I asked if I wanted the order for the pizza to be put in  I wish I would have been asked this when I placed the order for both items  The pizza arrived 35 minutes after ordering it  The restaurant is attractive and reasonably comfortable but the tables are spaced somewhat closer than I would like  Cloth napkins and tablecloths are a classy touchI absolutely love this place Food is so flavorful and portions are great The price is fair for the outstanding quality you get My favorite is stuffed scrod and red clam pasta"

    "review":"I came here for the deustchtown music fest and was immediately overwhelmed It was naturally busy but there were so many different levels and spaces to access with little direction The menu was disappointing for a vegetarian so I ended up not eating The staff inside didnt know where to direct us or just didnt care I get it they were busy but their job is to help us enjoy the spaceNegatives aside the space itself is great There are tons of areas to explore and relax with good beer The sound was also well done and that impressed me Im not sure Ill be back anytime soon Its just not my vibe and its pretty far out of the way for drinking and chilling I strongly recommend supporting them by buying their local beer though because thats the cool thing to doHaving been to Penn Brewery a few times lately and them having a groupon available I invited 2 couples out for dinner  Firstly they sat us directly next to a band making it impossible to hear each other and the waitress Second although the food was mostly as good as before the portions were much smaller than what weve had in the past with the same prices  This was a big let downLastly we had 3 couples 3 separate checks and they would only let us use 1 groupon for the entire table  I understand this is in the fine print but this is the only reason we came even came here to eat  Never experienced this problem before with grouponsNow we have to come back to use them Im sure that will be the last timeBeer sampler flight  take the whole 10  It is rare unlike my husband  that I can go through 10 different beers and go  yeah  I like that  AND 4 beers that were so good they actually forced my eyeballs to the back of my head  Weizen  a wheat with banana undertones Chocolate Stout  a collaboration with a local chocolate artisan Nut Bowl served with sugared rim glass flavored with yumminess and their St Nick Reserve  Their Penn Gold and Dark rocked  close eyes  think Octoberfest in Munich  Even their hoppier pilsners were really well balancedFood service band locale  perfect  The brats were wonderful  Good chili  Fresh salad  Gluten Free menu offerings were clearly indicated  Is a manager reading  Offer cider or a Gluten Free Beer alternate as well as a GF dessert choice I love you Penn BreweryPenn Brewery is solid Love the beer cheese great selection of brews and always a spacious table to sit and enjoy some kielbasa and pierogis If I have friends visit the burgh its a top 5 spot to take a them to show off our great cityThe menu is cool I got the Chicken pirogues that were stuffer with a chicken and buffalo mixture and topped with a blue cheese sauce It looked like a mess but tasted good I also had what I thought to be one of the most different items on a menu in a long time Kielbasa Rueben  The sandwich was just okay I would have like to taste more of the kielbasa the bread was very over powering There was also a potato pancake in the middle but couldnt really taste it much Place was nice inside and I would go back and recommend it to a friendI love beer and I really love the selection of beer at Penn Brewery Ive sampled the food from here and as a vegetarian I give it a thumbs up Not too many places care to have more than one vegetarian option but PB does As for the beer each selection is flavorful and unique Any time my parents throw a party in Philly we take a few cases of Penn Brewery beer and it is always a hitThe place itself is really really big and not only is it a fun drinking spot for a group of friends but families are also comfortable and welcome"

    "review":"Ive been there twice so far probably the best gourmet style pizza place in Pittsburgh There was not a lot of seating in the restaurant however it seems like there was enough room to add at least 5 more tables I feel like they are not utilizing the space to its fullist potentialWonderful service from the waitress BYOB great open window looking onto the street Lots of different pizzas to choose from my table chose 2 and both were delicious  There is only pizza on the menu The pizza crust was perfect Im happy I tried this pizza joint and will definitely be back soon It helps the wine store is across the street:Pittsburgh is growing fast Just three years ago there were barely any places to buy fancy pizza Also you would drop about 15 to get dough and maybe an afterthought of cheese albeit delicious delicious cheese and half a sneeze worth of toppings While those restaurants were able to keep my belly happy a recent outburst of similarly priced or cheaper restaurants with the same quality ingredients and more of it has popped up around the city giving those old ones some competitionPizza Taglio provides unique creative topping combinations on top of fresh dough The crust was absolutely perfect: crunchy on the outside with a little bit of chewiness in the inside The mozzarella was fresh and did that awesome gooey stretching that you would delete your internet history for if you watched it for too long I was boring and got the speck arugula mozzarella pizza with blistered tomatoes and balsamic glaze Simple concept but not always easy to execute perfectly I was happily pleased with the ratio of the toppings the arugula was fresh and spicy and the speck was fatty and crispyIn addition they have really sweet service Everyone was smiling and we had some great conversations with the people working there I had a pleasant afternoonOverall I see myself coming back here often on rainy days or simple date nightsBeen here twice now and will definitely come back again This little spot in E Liberty is pleasant and open with a simple menu of authentic pizzas with some unique offerings Im a margarita pizza connoisseur and they have some of the best in town Service is friendly and personal an overall pleasant experience each time You can enjoy your pizza with San Pellegrino or Italian cappuccino and almost feel like youre in a cafe in RomeIm going with 4 stars because I dont think I was able to take advantage of everything this restaurant has to offer But overall I had a good experience I came in one night to order a carryout pie It wasnt busy at all and they got started on my pizza as soon as I ordered I forgot the name of it but it was the one with an egg on it and I added sausage My only two criticisms are the price relative to the size of the pizza and the fact that it got cold really quickly Im certainly not an authentic Italian pizza connoisseur but it was great The most memorable part was that the crust was baked to a perfect crunchiness The cheese was perfectly melted it was a simple and very satisfying meal I really like that you can see the kitchen area where they bake the pizzas Everyone who worked there seemed to be enjoying themselves which I think created a friendly atmosphere Id definitely try it againThis is the best pizza Ive had outside Italy Inventive pies fresh ingredients cool atmosphere and incredibly reasonably priced I cant say enough good things about this place"

    "review":"I have been dining at the Golden Palace Buffet since I was in high school This is a favorite lunch  spot for me and my friends and family Upstairs they have a lunch buffet all you can eat for less than 700 dollars  During the lunch the buffet is always packed and sometimes you have to wait just a little bit to get a table    Anywhere from 2 to some times 3 nights a week I get dinner here while Im working  Lately I have grown fond of the combination lo mien and crispy crab rangoons The servings here are  very  generous I only regret that that the brown sauce doesnt adhere to the lo mien noodles that well In some dishes I have had in the past the veggies were limp and tasted as if they had been made hours before  Because of having items like beer and broccoli that was less than stellar I havent been to adventurous with trying other menu options  The shrimp fried rice also leaves a lot to be desired But because the proximity of this restaurant is so close to my  job I eat there when I want ChineseDont judge a run down old storefront by its run down old storefront  This is a decent Chinese restaurantMy husband and I are new residents to downtown Pittsburgh  We were reluctant to try this place because it looks dodgy from the outside  Around 7:30pm one randomness Thursday night we decided to give it a whirl  The buffet is only open for lunch and for dinner we were the only patrons therethey clearly do a busier lunch crowdOur expectations were low and WOW were we a bit surprised  Make no mistake for inviting storefront and welcoming and updated decor and ambiance they get a 0  that is a zero  Its clean just dated  For authentic Chinese dishes with a voice variety of options they get a solid 4Staff was friendly and spoke Cantonese  We shared a variety of dishes and all were authentic and good  We will go againSurprisingly this place is one of the better places to get your Chinese food fixthe american style fix that is"

    "review":"Worst pizza I have had in my entire 40 years of life Tasted like sauce and cheese on toast Frozen pizza is better than their pizza I wouldnt eat this pizza if it was freeGood pizza and hoagies  It is always busy  Cash onlySlow service and average pizza  Convenient to home depotI had heard lots of good things about Ventos Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things The service was slow and lukewarm The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http:wwwventospizzacom Also no credit or debit cards here  Youre directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of 175   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste goodBleh Ive tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad The crust is not homemade pretty sure I saw them take it out of a plastic bag and it sure tastes yuck It wasnt very hot either I am definitely going elsewhere next timeWhat a wonderful hidden gemMy boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times  The service is wonderful  the employees are patient kind and helpful  The food isnt 5 star but it IS really really good and best of all cheap as hellSure the pizza may not be cut into pizza shape but that doesnt make it any less wonderful at all  Everything I have ever had here is wonderful and I will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business"

    "review":"This  is a an old soda fountain  pharmacy and they also serve breakfast lunch dinner   They serve the famous Pamelas Hotcakes which are my favorite  Inside there is the original woodwork which looks nice and on the pharmacy side theres a large section that sells Steeler Pirates and Penquin stuff and theres some penny candy for the kids  The waitresses were very friendly and niceWhats not to love Best breakfast in the burgh hands downCome hungry with quarters for the meter 25  hr and cash to pay No plastic accepted hereYou wont be disappointedPancakes were off the hook Those will bring me back for sure  Theyre very thin  almost crepe like What I wont order again are the potatoes  They were a killed mushy mess with raw onions scattered throughout Typical diner coffee nothing special  Service was fast and friendly    If it werent for the hotcakes I wouldnt go back but they made up for the taters and joeI have been to all of the Pamelas diners in the Pittsburgh area and this one is HANDS DOWN the absolute best Once you eat here you will never want to eat at the Pamelas in Oakland The Strip or Squirrel Hill ever again I dont know what it is about this place but the food served at this Pamelas is exponentially better than the food served at other Pamelas particularly Oaklands location  no watereddown coffee or rubbery eggs here The portions are huge food comes out hot and the coffee is strong What else could you possibly need The other thing I love about this location is that they include their famous lyonnaise potatoes with their Big Lincoln breakfast special which is essentially the Morning After special at the Oakland Pamelas which doesnt include the potatoes I  know this is minor but I hated having to always pay for side of potatoes because who can leave Pamelas without having a taste of those Everything here is fantastic: lunch specials pancakes omelets etc Never have had one thing here that wasnt on point This location is larger and open not as cramped as some of the other locations housed inside of the old Lincoln Pharmacy in Millvale Tall ceilings a whole wall of windows and the old soda fountain at the front of the diner make for a fun and unique atmosphere Of course there is always the wait if you are going for any weekend morning breakfast or brunch but with Pamelas thats to be expected No big deal Tables turn fast here and we once went to this location with over 10 people in our party on a Sunday morning and waited only about 40 minutes The other good thing about this location is that there is room to stand in line in the pharmacyyou can buy old school candy knick knacks and cheesy Pittsburgh themed gifts Its not a bad wait at all Be sure to give this location a try and put it to the test of the other Pamelas in the area you wont be disappointedFood is good but I overheard a member of the staff say a racist comment about another worker I dont think Ill be going back to this locationWe have been to Pamelas a number of times The food and the service has slowly deteriorated Most recently we waited nearly an hour for a table and it was another 45 minutes for our food to be served The server gave us an excuse that they were trying a new system that all food was delivered at the same time Rather than delivering the food when it was ready The eggs were hard and over cooked The sausage was shriveled and tough The only entree that was decent were the hotcakes All in all we wont be back for a long time"

    "review":"Pros: Fast delivery within Squirrel Hill Moderate prices Fairly diverse menu does not have regular omissions typical to Squirrel Hill Pizza shops Several healthier options available on menu Discounts and coupons galore Online ordering is quick and easy Cons: Drinks forgotten on order very common for delivery orders Pizza is alright but not good Hoagiessubs are pretty bad cheap bread very little cheese  rubberized meat Deserts come frozen with the wax paper included Fries very tasty but pretty soggy as well Foreign delivery driver may have difficulty with delivery instructions While this is still a new establishment given the amount of direct competition in the immediate area I would have expected better The delivery time for my order was truly excellent but in their haste they disregarded my drink order The Driver did return however within several minutes after being chased down but the drink he returned with was still a variation on my drink order I would say that the quality of the food is OK not incredibly good but certainly not the worse pizza in town Also their personal pizza options and late night delivery option make it an attractive choice for delivery On my order the desert arrived mostly frozen and still wrapped in its original freezer wax paper Also the fries were placed in Styrofoam which makes them soggy There are 3 types of Pizza Shops in Squirrel Hill: Specialty Mineos Aiellos Napolis Luccis Big Chain Vocelli Dominos Pizza Hut Budget Amier Rialto Italian Village Bellino Pizza Bellino definitely belongs to the later category For me when judging a Squirrel Hill budget pizza shop I always use Pizza Amier as a comparison standard since their prices are the lowest in the neighborhood Are they more or less expensive then Pizza Amier Does their product taste better than Amier Does the taste justify the cost While they do offer a tasty product and some more diverse menu options than Amier I do not feel that the taste justifies the cost in this instance I would not recommend this Pizza Shop However if had no other option I wouldnt consider it out of the question eitherIf you eat pizza only and solely for the cheese you might prefer Mineos But if you enjoy tasting the other components of a pizza too then Pizza Bellino is a good callThe tomato sauce has actual flavor I mean you can actually taste tomatoes in itcrazy I know The sausage and bacon toppings are meaty and crispy the veggie toppings get nicely roasted as the pizza bakes and the cheese and crust are pleasantly browned The white sauce pizza is great too if you enjoy a full but mellow garlic flavorOnce every few months my wife and I try another pizzeria get disappointed and promptly revert back to Bellino as our standardGreat pizzas and fast deliveryI love all italian food From pasta to pizza to anything with cheese pepperoni  sauce  generally speaking Im not terribly picky when it comes to food Last night my boyfriend and I got a togo calzone their 5 cheese calzone to be exact The bread was over cooked none of the five cheeses were melted even after we microwaved it ourselves though the bread was still hot Next time I come to pittsburgh I will never even think of ordering from this businessOrdered a large garden salad and the buffalo chicken salad both were deliciousSalads were huge I had the buffalo the chicken was super spicy and delicious Fresh crisp vegetables great pizza place salad for sureAlso ordered breadsticks which were probably some of the best Ive ever had very doughy and the perfect amount of flavorDelivery was fast will absolutely be ordering againThis is by far the best pizza I have had in a while   I used to order from Italian village pizza  but their pizza has gone down hill and sucks lately my cousin said to try this place and not only is their menu amazing but the food is really really good"

    "review":"Well I had really high hopes for this place based on reviews It was good but not amazing by any stretch It was nice inside service was excellent We started with the Calamari that everyone on here is raving about It was thin chewy and smothered in so much sweet chili sauce that you couldnt even taste the calamari its self Whats the point of that I had the wedge salad which was very good Then I ordered a Ribeye medium rare I started into the steak from an end and it was outstanding but as I worked into the steak it was very rare in the middle almost blue and got very tough Ribeye is a fatty steak you have to get it hot enough to break that down or you just end up with a big piece of meat chewing gum So I ate about half the steak and left the rest They offered to recook it or give me a free dessert but frankly I had eaten enough at that point So I would give them another shot but I would definitely check doneness before digging in I would definitely skip the Calamari Oh the garlic mashed potatoes are very good as well highlight of the mealThe restaurant is attractive and comfortable although there are a number of tables for two where the diners are in very close proximity to each other along a banquette  I would not have enjoyed sitting at one of those tables Fortunately my wife and I were seated at a table for four  If you can avoid using valet parking do it and save 5 plus tip  I parked on the street around the corner from the restaurant at a metered spot where there is no enforcement on Sundays  The early nights menu which is offered all day on Sunday and until 6:00 p m other days offers good value  It contains a selection of entrees for 1995 and a selection of those that are 2595 which I was pleased that the restaurant offered on the final day of Valentines Day weekend  All include choice of soup or salad plus side dishes  The excellent breadbasket included warm pretzel rolls and a large part of butter part of it seasoned with pepper: interesting and tasty  There were also good sourdough rolls and a crisp seeded flatbread My wedge salad was very good as was my wifes caesar salad with fresh anchovies and the salads were a good size  The entrees were not served hot  I had dry aged sirloin chopped steak with mushroom sauce one of the 1995 items my wife ordered the two 6 ounce filet entree with bearnaise sauce from the 2595 menu My dish was good hers was not her filets were inexcusably tough We sat in front of the fireplace while waiting to be seated as my wife enjoyed am 11 Bombay gin martini: pricey but potent and wellmade I had a Samuel Adams lager draft beer and was pleased that unlike other steakhouses there was at least a tiny selection of draft brews here:  Samuel Adams and Guinness Service from a team of staff members was attentive and gracious  I appreciated that unlike most other premiere steakhouses in the area the noise level was moderate and that unlike at Eddie Merlots we were not hounded by a pretentious server who inflicted a minuteslong recitation of every possible dish without regard to whether we wanted to hear it  When asked if we wanted any additional side dishes we said no and unlike at Eddie Merlots we were not pushed to order any The service here was unpretentious  The cuisine here is not my favorite of the area steakhouses and the memory of the tough filets will remain with us  When I made the reservation I was asked if my wife and I were going to be celebrating Valentines Day which we were  I thought this meant that something special would be offered us such as the provision of a complimentary dessert but that was not the case  I am surprised that the restaurant does not participate in OpenTable the company which makes reserving a table easy and offers premiums to the dinerReceived a free amuse bouche coupon and it was delish Goat cheese salad also fantastic  Great service great bread great wine  But the filet mignon was the toughest worst piece of meat ever  I got a headache trying to chew it and left a portion on my plate because it was just too hard to eat  Too bad  I will not be going back because the price for what you ultimately received is not a good or tasty valueHip and classy I ate the biggest filet while sitting on a couch  I ordered the hines ward and it was phenomenal  Along with brussel sprouts and asparagus everthing was cooked to perfection  Its a little pricey but the service was top notch   Very rarely do i order dessert but i made an exception when i seen a piece of carrot cake come out the back  So i ordered the colossal red velvet cake and i must say colossal describes it perfectly It was literally like they gave me a whole top of a wedding cake  Its was so good im mean so so good  I was with 3 people and all of us couldnt finish one piece   I would definitely stop back there anytime i want a steak as big as my face lol And especially if i was trying to impress a lady friendMy wife and I wanted a special place celebrating an event Choose Hyde Park Big disappointment We were seated ordered drinks no problem Waiter came over to take our order My wife ordered the lobster bisque and I ordered shrimp cocktail and opinion soup For the entree my wife ordered the lobster tail and I ordered the lg mushgarlic steak medium rare Lobster soup and shrimp cocktail came both pretty descent Salads came but Im still waiting for my onion soup Waiter finally comes by 15 mins later to tell me my soup is in the oven and should be out shortly He also said we never ordered a side this is the waited telling us we didnt order not him telling us he didnt take the order 10 mins later all toll 25 mins my soup finally arrived  My wifes lobster was served first and my steak a couple mins later The broiled lobster didnt look very appetizing It was tough and rubbery like it wasnt cooked all the way My steak for being medium rare was dry and tasteless We had my wifes lobster sent back They came back with 2 smaller tails with little improvement just a little sweater Our bill was over 18000 For that kind of money you would be walking out of there licking your chops and thinking whens your next return NOTthere is something on the menu for everyone i got the black and gold30 something ounces of tomahawk rib chop whatmy wife got the polamalu lobster16 to 18 oz if you know where it gets better than this please let me know"

    "review":"Delicious savory crepes and sandwiches Nice variety compared to other downtown fast food The Chicken and Mushrooms Crepe was very good and consisted of grilled chicken mushrooms onion and provolone and mozzarella cheese in bechame sauce in a nicely prepared crepe No frills dining area but plenty of seating Convenient location although not bustling great for carryout and close to the point parkHere is the BEST thing I just realized about Gios they deliver Coffee cappuccino latte mocha chai tea pop lemon aid and other drinks using electronic apps with a minimum order of 10  Hallelujah Its an answer to wishes that Ive had for years now I cant believe I didnt catch on to this sooner Weve enjoyed this hidden gem for their quick sandwiches and crepes and I just found out about the coffee being able to come along One of the things Ive always liked the most about Gios is their Panini size For only 8 The crispy bread filled with turkey tomato red pepper  cheese reheats beautifully I savor one half for lunch and the other for dinner of lunch the next day Their paninis dont come with fries and I prefer it that way because theyre huge I usually dont eat fries They tend to go home and be given to our dogs The dogs dont complain but the vet recently called our small dog fat So the less fries the better for us all They do offer a lunch option during the week that is a half size with fries The half size is more than filling however I prefer to not order that item and go for the full size thats the same price as the lunch special  I havent decided which panini is my favorite Its a struggle to decide between the Turkey or the chicken The same with the wrap I have trouble deciding which is my favorite and I often modify my selection swapping out mayo for ranch if its whats offered Thats never a problem I tend to lean towards ordering the Buffalo chicken or chicken the most I enjoy the spinach wrap used for the chicken wrap when the mayo is substituted for ranch Now where Gios really deserves 5 stars is this their crepes They are delicious And you really want to try to try them There are savory and sweet Trying to decide which are best is impossible Saving room to have both is almost impossible as well I suggest going with a friend who enjoys splitting the first time That way you can try the best of both on your first visit Amongst the savory you will have to decide if youre ready to go spicy or not Their spicy options are fantastic The red chicken has a wonderful kick to it that is beautifully rounded out by the onions  cheeses The Veggie Crepe with tomato and spinach is in a creamy sauce w feta Superb Now the sweet crepes Personally I could possibly eat your left shoe if it was slathered in Nutella And while they do have Nutella and I do suggest ordering them do try the other varieties I enjoy the very basic and light classic crepe served with butter sugar and lemon They are beautiful  The choice between chocolate Nutella berry strawberry whipped cream banana walnut and such is all a personal preference that will be a delight to eat once placed in the thin delicate pancakeAfter being on the road for a few hours I was looking forward to trying this place Unfortunately my family and I arrived and the cafe had a sign on the door that said be back in 7 minutes Lights were on door was locked I didnt mind waiting but after 15 minutes of waiting on the street we decided to go somewhere else I even called the cafe a few times hoping someone may just be in the back I just recommend that the next time it is around 5 pm on a Tuesday with a Beyonc concert happening in a couple hours that their be someone in the store Maybe next timeOrdered crepes for lunch delivery and they were a pleasant change from pizza sandwiches and salads Reasonable delivery time A little pricey but like I said  a nice change Online ordering was easy delivery dude and manager were both pleasant Would definitely order againMy friend and I ate lunch there today  Absolutely delicious food  The best sandwich and fries town  I would highly recommendWent here for the good reviews but the service here makes me vow that I would never go back not only did they hear my order wrong but they almost sent me out the door with only half the stuff I ordered More than disappointed"

    "review":"The food at this place is at best mediocre but it deserves something better than 1 star given the good service Every other place in the neighborhood was either packed or seemed like it would have slow service so we decided to come in here despite it looking like it was closed with no one inside We were served very quickly as promised and its not the worst Chinese food Ive ever had I know thats not saying a lot but given the limited options in the area it may be worth knowing about this place as a possible alternativeI cant tell you how bad this place is regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for deliverySeriously this place has the worst Chinese food Ive had in my whole lifeI think Im spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets Liangs buffet is not great It fills your stomach but thats about it Their buffet has a smaall selection of soso Chinese food On the plus side service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open Thats worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at nightBad Worst Chinese food in Pittsburghfood was st no one inside except cookowner and a waitress it was late at night near closing only thing i could find open  I dont like chinese food to begin with cept rice chicken and beef teriaki ok so i order rice with butter or gravy if they have it no such luck plain rice i think ok i can deal with that WRONGhow can you fk up plain ricealong with the rice i found bits of boiled eggs onions bits of red  green peppers corn some bits of meat i couldnt recognize and something else it tasted awful  took about 10 bites total till i seen the various bits at the bottom then got a whiff of the egg it made me gagso i spit the last bite out downing what i had with water and took it to the hotel room left it with a note free chinese food eat me no one touched it I found it later in the trash canThose that ate here and think the food is even ok have no sense of smell or tastebuds or they are stoned and will eat anything 0 stars for food taste and quality i do give them credit for willing to serve me so late when all the staff went home wait wasnt too long 1015 minsI had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food Ive had  Well this place manages to be worse than itThe place is rather run down  The buffet was really terrible  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source  It just wasnt a great environment  Try something else definitely"

    "review":"Its not a Market District but it works in a pinch Nice bakery not great mind you Good Latino Italian and seafood sections Its small by todays supermarket standardsThe staff is always nice Very accommodating They dont have as big of a selection as other locations but its worth going here for the friendliness Used to shop at the moon twp giant eagle and hated the employees They were always rude and acted like you were bothering them when you asked a questionI agree this place is lacking in many areas but Debbie in customer service area needs to be applauded for her can do attitude  She has helped me out on several occasions and solved many problems I come from the land of Publix so imagine my disappointment when I moved here  There is no seafood department There is a lack of selection and cleanliness in the meat department  They only ever have one or two  checkout lanes open plus the self checkout open  Use the self checkout if you dareThis seems like a dying store at one end of a shopping mall where everything else is closed Its depressing on the outside for sure The insides a little better and had all the supermarket basics but a good portion of the staff appear rather rough around the edges  The whole location and appearance gave me the feeling that everyday the staff is expecting the word from corporate that the store is closing today  Its OK when you need some basics which is exactly why I came to this storeI hear the banjos playing  This is where the characters from the movie Deliverance come to work and to shop  Having been to the newest addition in the Giant Eagle portfolio I was somewhat stymied by the fact that this store had the same name  When I entered I apparently went the wrong way through the entire store  Well who laid at the store in that bassackwards way it was  No one is going to walk past the cashiers dodging all of the outgoing shoppers to get to the supposed beginning of the route you are supposed to take  Someone needs to rethink the circulationThen the lack of fresh produce read as wilted and moldy and the lack of any true selectionwell I wont be returning"

    "review":"I was really impressed by my yogurt bowl with hummus vegetables and pita topped with honey lemon and sea salt an interesting combination that I completely enjoyed The staff kept the line of customers moving around 12 pm and were very polite A terrific place for lunch to go  and the food was fresh and had great flavorReally disappointing On a Sunday evening when there is the arts festival two sporting events and the gay pride events the restaurant was immensely underprepared When ordering I asked for lentils as my protein but they were only a few left The server substituted rice for the protein without asking Both the rice and lentils were undercooked Additionally I ordered a spanakopita and was told they would bring it to me shortly They never brought the spanakopita so I asked the server and was told they were out of spanakopita There just didnt seem to be any communication between staff about what was on the menu or what needed to be refilled in the bar areaGirl wiped her nose with her bare hands then automatically began handling my food with her bare hands Needless to say I walked outI came in and got a gyro during lunch The line was long but moved through pretty quickly Good service  The gyro meat was great along with the yogurt sauce and other toppings  Im definitely coming back in to try the chicken next timeI have only eaten at Simple Greek in downtown one time but I have tried to go multiple times While I admit the food was pretty good the one time I was there the service has been regularly subpar The first time there was a really long wait for my fries and multiple orders were accidentally screwed up or given to the wrong people It was hectic and confusing trying to make sure my group got the right food Despite this the food was good so I wanted to go again with my husband So on 42916 my husband and I drove into the city to get some Simple Greek for dinner I checked the hours online which said it was open until 7pm We arrived at the restaurant at 6:36pm The lights were off but the door was open so we stuck our heads in Two young guys were standing down by the counter I said hello and asked if they were open The one guy grunts no were closed So I said I thought it said you were open until 7pm online He mumbled something which I couldnt understand  never coming any closer to my husband and I  so I said We cant understand anything youre saying It said online that youre open until 7pm  is that not accurate He completely ignored me the second time and turned his back to us Then my husband spoke up and said We asked you a question If youre not open until 7pm how late are you open then The guy finally responded Were only open until whenever its not busy And then walked even further away from us Ugh if theres one thing I cant stand its poor customer service because its free It costs nothing to be polite If the young man would have walked over to us and said Im sorry were not open right now and Yea our online hours arent always accurate we tend to close around 6:30pm we would have felt a lot better about the experience Instead we were left with a terrible taste in our mouth from the two immature and rude employeesI was expecting more Dont get me wrong they load the gyro up with meat and toppings but the meat is where its at While making it I seen him get the gyro meat that was soaking in I guess water ew tastes dry and makes my mouth dry after eating it had a weird taste Why wouldnt they use the rack of meat thats spinning behind them The sauce wasnt that good either I also got the fries Greek style nothing special but they were good Probably wont be back"

    "review":"Hokkaido just opened on Browns Hill Road We really liked the food here  The variety is nice and the deserts are way better then the usual fair at seafoodsushi buffets  The Sushi was good but not a lot of selectionWe do plan to go back and would recommend it to a friendPrices are reasonable for this type of place8per person weekday lunch16per person Dinner and Sunday all day13 Saturday BrunchThis restaurant is a textbook example of a solid Asian buffet The sushi is fine with some entry level staples and a few types you wont find premade on a Giant Eagle shelf The deserts are okay but nothing to write home about Overall this is as good a place as any for solid no frills seafood However were I to live farther away I dont think Id make a special tripTry the Thai style calamari Its good if they dont over cook itI went here for a friends birthday and it was surprisingly pretty good Its probably one of the only Asian buffets in Pittsburgh within a reasonable distance from Pitts campus There is a very wide selection of food My favorite part was the sushi barthey had lots of different kinds of sushi and selections of sashimi as well Dessert was alrightthey offered some fruitfruit salads ice cream and cake To my surprise they also had white fungus birds nest soup a lightly sweetened soup with a slightly syrupy consistency that my mom often made for me at home It was really refreshing to see something like that in Pittsburgh There is a chocolate fountain as well but the chocolate tastes more like Hersheys syrup than actual chocolate and has a grainy texture so I wasnt a huge fan of it Still cool thoughThe food is decent especially the sushi but the staff is TERRIBLE My friends from work and I went to dinner here together We had previously researched the menu and prices via the mobile website The website advertised Monday  Thursday 1699 dinner buffet Not only did the managerwaitress say we were wrong about the advertised price but the manager continued to say that the price did not come up as 1699 on her phone when my friend opted to show the manager the price on the website we were referring to We ended up being charged 1799 each ALSO when it came time for the checks the waitress Joyce stood around while each of us signed our receipts and went around and checked each of our receipts all 7 of us to see how much we tipped If she noticed someone did not add a tip on their receipt most of us were planning on using cash she commented that that price of the buffet did not include the tip Then she collected our receipts and stood at the table next to us for about 5 or so minutes to wait and see who was putting cash down She was huffing and putting the whole time Terribly rudeI give one star because I cant choose no star The service and waiters attitude is extremely bad The food is ok but I wont be here never ever againHow can you go wrong with a buffet with an endless supply of a large variety of sushi and a chocolate fountain I do have to say the warning sign on the tables was a bit much  I know people do waste a lot of food at buffets but it is not welcoming to be threatened with being charged for unfinished food  It is a buffet and sometimes I take things to try that I absolutely dont like  Im not going to eat them just because of your threats  I was in the area and convinced my husband that we should finally try this buffet  It was a Friday night and while it was crowded it wasnt overwhelmingly so as the tables are well spaced out  I was in the mood for sushi so I started there  There were about 10 types of rolls four of five types of pieces and four types of sashimi  They also had the sauces to add if you wanted to   None of the rolls or pieces I ate were out of this world or extremely memorable but they were tasty  Most had at least one type of sauce on them though so if you arent a fan of sauce on your rolls you wont like this sushiAside from the sushi they also have a selection of the typical Chinese buffet fair  My husband tried a good number of those dishes and again said they were tasty but nothing overly memorable  They did have a few dim sum options which was a nice touchOverall it was pricey around 20 per person but if you went somewhere else and got an appetizer salad entrees and dessert you would be paying at least that if not more"

Applebees Christmas gift and the best part of this gift was my boyfriends reaction to me later  He has never been to an Applebees  Or an Olive Garden  Or a Chilis  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night  So hes new to these restaurants which so many of us grew up with  Id only been to an Applebees a handful of times but I was down to go back  it seems like they sort of have everything no matter what youre hungry forSince were spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago WOOHOO we dont always have time to make dinner  So we busted out the Applebees gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods  When we arrived this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar  I missed the finer points of the interaction since he was talking to my boyfriend but he basically insinuated that hed just sat some large tables or something and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didnt have the time to serve us or something and he didnt want us to wait for what Im not sure so he was basically like Can you sit at the bar  Which was weird because there were like at least a dozen open tables   But whatevs  The cool kids sit at the bar and we are the cool kidsChuck the bartender was running this show  Dude  He was on top of everything  Taking orders serving drinks answering phones getting takeout orders keeping his bar neat and tidy  he was HOPPING  We were both in awe just watching him  That man is earning his tips for reals  So Id recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working  Hes also cute so bonus there  The Applebees bar is kind of a hilarious place  random people having drinks as if its a real bar and not a restaurant this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe some annoying fratty peopleand us  A healthy mixI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams  mad props for Shock Top on draft not expecting that from Applebees  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip which I believe was half price as are all apps during happy hour  It was served with regular tortilla chips like from a bag but the dip itself was pretty tasty  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfyingMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter and it was amusingly huge for a side  Iceberg lettuce cherry tomatoes crispy croutons shredded cheese tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side  I bought it to balance out my entree but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy you know Like eating crispy water  With cheese and croutons  YAY HEALTHThen came the entrees  I got an order of wings which I think is technically listed as an appetizer with Sweet and Spicy Sauce which was listed as the secondhottest sauce on the menu  They were pretty decent  served hot juicy chicken and the sauce was sweet and sticky  It was a little too sweet for me  picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce and thats what the wing sauce was like  but it still made a satisfying meal  My boyfriend got one of their special burgers from their new New Orleans menu something like a Bourbon Bacon burger  They asked him pink or no pink which we thought was funny  He said pink and the burger came out with like a tiny touch of maybepink in the middle  Mediumrare this aint  He said it was okay  Not great  Just a burger  I didnt taste it I just nibble on a few of his fries which were pretty averageThat all came in at around 30 aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount  I have no interest in going to Applebees again because I can get better burgers pasta chicken bar food everything etc anywhere else but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop this wouldnt be a bad choice  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar foodConsistent service  the bar w Chuck pouring drafts and mixing up fruity delights Decent food  dont expect great Lots of under 500 calorie and Weight Watcher items Several tvs to watch games Youll find everyone from bookreading wives that didnt want to cook to laborers grabbing a cheap steak  a few cold ones to huge celebrations filling many tables Its a great community asset for many  The Ritz it aintFirst off I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible Sometimes thats not possible  in the future Ill avoid this one no matter whatIts always a zoo the servers are not interested in what they are doing and do it poorly Food comes out of order or not at all The managers dont care We actually had a waitress spill the soup catch most of it in her hand and dump it back in right in front of us Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another Just go anywhere else it cant be worseNothing special Precooked meals that taste microwavedNormally one would think one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something Ive been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a coworker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out firsteven though Ive done this before they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture and staff does not appear to be properly trained"

    "review":"Nothing overly good and nothing wrong Chicken really didnt have any flavor but not badIts too good Breakfast sandwiches are great omelettes are great chicken is AMAZING sides are tasty prices are goodBecause of cold weather out my buddies at work decided to go somewhere close Pittsburgh Poultry definitely covers the friendly customer service aspect You are greeted when you walk in and if you want to substitute anything on the menu for something else they oblige I got the White meat 2 piece meal with potato wedges I got the breast and wing with an extra wing The wings were ok in size but the breading and flavoring on both the breast and wings were good Chicken was cooked properly and wasnt overcooked and dry Sauces for dipping are all free which is nice My only complaint is the lack of sides I do not like coleslaw or baked beans so i was stuck with only the potato wedges which had a nice flavor as well Prices are reasonable and not out of this world which is good for someone working downtown trying not to spend a lot The dinein area is also kept clean from what I sawAs Previously mentioned in another Yelpers review since George Aikens closed there has not been a fried chicken to compare Until nowGood service nice mom and pop place  Cole slaw was awesome  Will try it again for saladsThis is one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh  The people are so nice and the food is cooked perfectly  The breakfast is the best Ive had in a long while  Its a small hole in the wall but you have to try it  Seriously nicest people in a food place Ive ever dealt with  Thanks for a great experience and great foodDrumstick roll here  Ive got something to cluck about I was pecking around town and noticed that the burger joint that used to be on Cherry Way is now a fried chicken place  What a welcome addition to the downtown lunch and breakfast scene  The sign out front boast that theyve got the Best Chicken in the Burg  Now I dont want to ruffle any feathers here but lets get real ever since George Aiken closed up shop there hasnt been any chicken in the Burgh That sign should read The Only Chicken in the Burgh and its some really good chicken tooI stopped in for lunch today and got a four piece meal which is supposed to include half a chicken potato wedges and slaw Im not complaining but I got two breast instead of a breast and a thigh The chicken was deep fried super moist with a tasty slightly peppery coating The breast were huge but the drumstick and wing was average in size Still though it was more food than I could eat On the menu you get a choice of a two piece meal or a four piece meal I thought a two piece would be too small so I went with the four piece meal I wish they had a three piece meal but its nice that you can go a la carte and get exactly what you want In addition to fried chicken meals they also have chicken tenders chicken sandwiches fish sandwiches and a breakfast sandwich  The facility itself is geared more towards take out than dining in There is a counter along the window with count them seven stools where you could enjoy your lunch Theres also two tables with five chairs available for those that insist on dining in So hey dont stay cooped up in your office for lunch If you can wing it go ahead and get yourself some lunch or breakfast at the Pittsburgh Poultry Company  Then maybe you too will have something to crow about"

    "review":"This place is okay The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us The food was also not too good It was very bland and didnt have a lot of taste to it I will not be coming backI think its time to sacrifice time and convenience When we visit the areathis place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide Robinson and Ross Park Even though it closer to my Dads House when visitingits time for us to part ways The food and service is never as good at this location I love love love their tofu tacosbut this was just eh this timeit was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just oldbleh I couldnt even finish them even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them Total BummerFirst of all I have to say I didnt even realize there was a Mad Mex location in the South Hills The location is a little hidden at the end of a shopping center off the main road But Im very happy this is here I foresee myself meeting for margaritas in the future since its so close to homeMy friend and I came here for our annual Gobblerito Friendsgiving meal The Gobblirito was good as it is every year I wish there had been a extra side of gravy or something since it did get a little dry Im not sure if its a new thing this year or just something they do at this location but there were black beans mixed in with the mashed potatoes which I thought was a little weirdI also got a strawberry margarita I asked for it frozen but the waitress said their frozen thingy was down so that was a little disappointing but it was still good on the rocks Service was okay Our waitress took awhile to get to our table but our food came out fast Id like to come back tho this location again to see how the normal menu items areMad Mex is my go to place to eat It could be the awesome beer list which always includes at least a couple of IPAs OK beer is a bonus but the food is fantastic My current favorite is the wingorito a burrito stuffed with boneless wings with your choice of sauce I love the insane southwest sauce and go off the board by changing out the chicken for shrimp Tonight I used my birthday free entre and got steak and shrimp in my burrito The second half will be lunch tomorrowBeer selection: 45 starsFood: 35 starsThis location is my favorite mostly because it doesnt seem to get quite as busy as the other locations As with all Mad Mexs the draft beer list is always great with a broad range of styles Youre sure to find a beer youre in the mood for And happy hour is hard to beat with half off drafts and wings from 4:306:30pm on weekdays The burritos seem to be a hit but i think theyre overrated The nacho grande is huge and loaded and tastes alright Wings are pretty decent especially with their blue cheese All in all id say come here for happy hour to feel the full affect of Mad MexGobbleritoI love Mad Mex and all the offerings   My favorites are the Wingorito and Gobbleritowhen offeredThe Wingorito has your beloved wing sauce mixed in their hefty burritoThe Gobblerito is their seasonal Thanksgiving burrito with a side of cranberryBoth are awesome   Schedule your training appointments or your purge because these are highcalorie affairs but worth it   Top it off with one of their signature drinks and you cannot go wrong :Enjoy"

    "review":"I have visited this place often Not only because they offer tasty food but also because of the smile and friendliness of the owner I have always felt comfortable dining there whether alone or with friendsI should probably do this as two different reviews but oh well they get oneIve come here for lunch many times with friends They have some of the best tadka daal and I LOVE it dont tell my mother in law Its not a typical Indian lunch as they serve it with a fresh salad as well and in cute little bowls on your plate Its good though perhaps a bit overpricedHowever I work for a nonprofit and when trying to use my purchasing card for a business meal they refused to refund the tax charged we are tax exempt This to me seems like bad business practices and hence why I will not give them 4 stars only 3Really good food albeit not too great value for money Try Mango Lassi here : HeavenlyWe had the samosas and the saag paneer Absolutely delicious and perfect spice level  medium spice is perfect for those who like spicy food but arent necessarily looking for a challenge  Its a little pricier than your standard Indian in Pittsburgh but its worth it  Not too greasy  They definitely add their own flair  Service was great and the atmosphere was meh to relaxing Nice light fixtures  Were not too big on ethos thoughThe food was subpar and wasnt special compared to other Indian restaurants Ive eaten at Service was awful We waited 30 minutes before they took our order They had four people working that night with only a few tables and all they did was stand around cleaning silverware and cups They only filled up our waters once they heard one of us complain They were not coordinated at all as when one person brought us plates another removed them only to bring us different plates One of our orders were also messed up We ordered butter chicken and received shrimp in some sauce They said it was definitely chicken but we could tell that it was most indeed shrimpLastly I saw that they offered a 10 discount upon check in on yelp but they denied it because theres no button for itWas really not what I was expecting at allI am a semiregular visitor In other reviews I have noticed lots of complaints regarding customer service but in my opinion there isnt a significant difference between the service in this place and elsewhere Courteous and quick enough for meThe food is good if you order it spicy Their Baingan Bhartha especially is quite delicious The other items on the menu are also in general tasty and wellprepared though I wouldnt recommend the Dal Tadka it isnt what you are used to if you are IndianOverall Im giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of two reasons:1 They serve rice with every dish and do not allow for substitutions To be fair this appears to be the general practice in all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that Ive been to this is remarkably pointless and inauthentic It makes absolutely no sense to serve rice with a majority of the dishes on the menu especially the dry dishes This is the biggest reason I do not go there more frequently and I almost gave a 3 star rating because of this If you work at Yuva India and you are reading this I sincerely suggest that you allow your customers to replace the rice with some basic butter naan If that is too expensive for you at least include an option to upgrade the rice to naan for a small price2 In my opinion the price is a little too high The food here is quite good but there are other Indian places that serve equally good food at a lower price Nearby Tamarind comes to mind"

    "review":"My only complaint would be that it takes a bit longer than it should for someone to acknowledge you at the front door I get it if they are busy a simple hellobe right with you could work Their food is on par with other eat n parks that I have been to The staff is friendly I have been here many times and will continue to dine hereI dont understand why the staff is completely defective on the late night shift Every time Ive come here after work late the waitresses disappear faster than Houdini cant get an order right or are just flat out rude or terrible I work in Hospitality  either the owner should completely reassess this location or shut it down  let an actual decent restaurant take its place Sad because the other locations are decentAs far at ENPs go this is one of my favorites  The service is always quick  Always  Ive never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for food even when theres a line out the doorThis ENP which is listed as being in Bellevue though its actually in Avalon was the hang out spot for the teens when I was in high school and still appears to be so judging by the number of kids that flood here after football games  Think The Max but with less magic tricks and far fewer danceoffs  The wait staff will yell at kids if they get too crazy and in some cases kick them out  Much appreciated  The Avalon cops also hang out here at night so it never gets too rowdyThe food here is diner food  Not much else to it  Dont order the steak and you wont be disappointed  There is a pretty big salad bar at this location and the food changes based on the time of dayOne thing that I love about this particular location is the speed at which they attack takeout orders  Again never a more than a 20 minute wait  They also have fresh bakery items in the case which I love since not all ENPs bother with that  Make sure you get a Smiley Cookie before you leaveOr a dozenA Pittsburgh staple  Theyre so familyfriendly their mascot see they have a mascot  totally family friendly is a smiling cookieMost recently I was here for brunch after church though Ive been coming here for years  The servers are always friendly its usually pretty clean and the buffet is normally wellstocked  I love their new healthconscious approach to their menu they still have the classics like the breakfast smile with full fat and grease or the smart breakfast smile with less fat and grease  Fresh fruit instead of bacon was actually a refreshing change and I love me some bacon and my eggbeaterlike egg white substitute really did taste good and eggy  My father had the same thing but the original version  Those hashbrowns they have are like fried gold  always the first thing that gets eatenOur server was always quick with the coffee  Even though she had other tables shed take care of us first so as to allow time to chat with her regulars  I can appreciate that it makes you want to be a regularPros: relatively quick service its been faster but it was Sunday fresh take on the menu servers take care of the regularsCons: this time the food delivery was really lagging no fault of the server the kitchen must have been slammed booths werent fully clean before we sat downThis is one of my favorite Eat n Parks I have very fond memories of coming to this one and the one further north on Ohio river boulevard in Sewickley with friends and family over the years The food is fresh and fast I love the salad bar and that they offer healthy options and that they are always striving to expand and improve the menu If you want a casual tasty meal that isnt fast food this is a great choiceYou usually cant go wrong with a quick inexpensive meal from a classic restaurant like Eat N Park We usually eat breakfast here which is always fast and hot Dinner we almost always do carry out When picking up carry out they open up every box to make sure you get everything you ordered While you wait they also offer you a drink which is great hospitality Staff is super friendly and kind"

    "review":"Pretty much like every other McDonalds clean with fast courteous service The food is consistent worldwide which is why you go to a McDonaldsFree ATT WiFi was exceptionally quick when I went today for breakfastWith all the local restaurants in the Strip District McDonalds doesnt really look like it belongs but it has been there for as long as Ive been going to Pittsburgh I walked from the hotel so I didnt have to deal with the small parking lot and construction around the parking area One interesting thing I noticed is even though most of their menu items were more expensive than McDonalds near my home ice cream cones were only 49 cents 52 cents with tax What a deal Service was fast and courteous and the dining area was reasonably clean as one would expect for the chainThis McDs is a mess  I have stopped there maybe 3 times and last night is the lastI had to wait at the drive thru for 6 minutes I always time it when someone says wait one min Then she took my order I had to wait to pay because 2 cars ahead of me must have waited also I get my food and head home which is 5 min from the McDs When I got home my food was cold I had that new chicken sandwich and was very disappointed It was cold the breading on the chicken was soggy the chicken was dry and tough and the bun tasted like cardboard I took it apart and microwaved for a couple of seconds and put ranch dressing to moisten itI also put the bun in the toaster for a few seconds This made it edible but not goodMy fries were cold and dried out so I threw them awayMy coke was fine  I confess I go to mcd when I feel like a mcd hamburger Its a taste of my youth I foolishly try other things sometimes and generally feel disappointed except for the aforementioned hamberger and I also like the soft serve ice cream The Icetea is rather a hit and miss because the bad ones are because they dont clean the ice tea containersmakers well enough or they use powderedconcentrated  tea to lower the cost How hard is it to make iced tea folks I have only done drive thru at this place because they have parking police that jump on you as soon as you get out of the carPoor experience I gather they were having issues in the kitchen but I waited patiently for close to 10 mins for my breakfast sandwich Then I distinctly heard the manager say just give me an egg I dont care if its hot followed by just use Canadian bacon even though Id clearly ordered regular bacon A bit ridiculous Wont be backThis is by far the worst McDonalds in the 412 Warning: the bathroom stall door does not open You literally have to imagine yourself as a police office busting down a door to do a search warrant if you want to get out of the bathroom stall The staff is traditionally standing around talking and you can clearly here what theyre saying at all times I pretty much just go here for coffee because its convenient and Ive never had a quality meal from this location If youre in the strip do yourself a favor and check out one of the many specialty places that are around the same price as theyre plentifulThis is one of the businesses in the area that is open past 8pm  Im not quite sure what it is about the Strip District that everything closes so early  Regardless this McDonalds has pretty slow service compared to what Im used to seeing everywhere else and its really small inside too  One big plus is that they have free wifi so if youre connected to one McDs youre connected to them all  This is good since I cant use my data in the US"

    "review":"Like any other EatnPark  A great local diner chain with much better food than the nationals  Signs say the food is sourced from local farmers in the Summer  A good thing because Western PA grows some of the finest produce in the countryI ordered an omelette and the salad bar The omelette was gross They used the processed cheese food instead of cheese and I couldnt stomach it It had a chemical taste I think it was made properly just crappy ingredients They did take back the omelette and did not charge me but then boosted the salad price because there was no other meal with it In the end I paid way too much to eat salad No protein is no goodService was ok and the people were nice just dont order anything with cheeseThe zucchini planks were thin crispy and delicious Paired with the soup and salad bar it was a pretty satisfying meal for a very low price"

    "review":"THE best cheesesteaks freshest buns there is nothing bad hereEverything here is the best Mancinis bread is always fresh I always kick myself when I eat a sandwich anywhere else when rudys is open because you cant get any better Everything on the menu will leave smiling the employees are the greatest too Cap and egg with mayo Im telling youRecently realized that I have been a customer of Rudys for 40 years When I was a kid we got Sicilianstyle pizza from his previous location on Washington St in Swissvale Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fixNow to be clear this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like There is no ambiance No decor No table service No boutique brands of soda Nothing on the menu is infused Youll probably want to get your sandwich to goBut if you want a delicious cheesesteak I dont know why you would want to go anywhere else The two best hoagie places in the area are less than a halfmile apart on the same street   Rudys and the Triangle barIm a southerner which doesnt qualify me as a born expert on cheese steak But you dont need an advanced degree to know that this place puts out an absolutely delicious sandwich I live 1100 miles away but my first and third and fourth and fifth stop when I go to Pittsburgh is always Rudys I usually avoid meat cheese and white carbs but this definitely merits an exception I have tried everything and like most all of it but always get the steak and cheese with egg We never even heard of that back home Get the smaller one unless youre sharing I have to take part of the small to go its enormousI think theyve been in the same place for 30 years and never heard about paint Who cares what it looks like though when its the best thing you ever put in your mouth"

    "review":"Carson City Saloon is just ohhhhkaaaayAdmittedly Ive only ever ordered lunch to go from here and while the service is usually friendly the sandwiches and wraps Ive had have always been rather bland My most recent experience was a takeout order for the Veggie Wrap which consisted of a somewhat soggy mixture of grilled vegetables red peppers eggplant mushrooms  all ingredients I normally love tomato lettuce provolone and dressing It seemed that the ratio of dressing to everything else was disproportionate in favor of the dressing hence why everything was a bit soggy Oddly enough with so much dressing youd think there would be a wealth of flavor but still SOMEHOW some way it was still uber blandWhile Im not really a sportsbarkindofgal The Saloon seems like it might be better at night for big groups yelling and lots of ESPN action  preferably under the influence of a few roundsSomeone named Marissa was outside giving away 3 off 5 which was a great incentive for buying something here especially when coupled with happy hour I got their smothered fries and was surprised that their portion sizes were so small However it not was not a huge deal since I was mostly focused on their drinks I was really excited to try their jello shots and it was delicious but didnt phase me at all despite me being a lightweight I wouldnt get a jello shot here if your goal here is to get sloppyI stopped down for Monday wing night and was very impressed It wasnt too crowded and all the bros that people are talking about were downstairs so we chose to sit on the second floor Since there was no Pittsburgh game going on everything was fairly calm and smooth Two soft drinks and 20 wings and the bill was under 12 Not bad Not too mention the service was great and friendly The wings were good and they had at least 30 different sauces Some of the wings were a little small and didnt have much meat but for 035 you cant complain The only complaint I had was there was only one smaller TV upstairs It wasnt an issue but the person I was dining with wanted to watch  the football game and because of the size it was a little hard for him to see There are a lot of TVs downstairs including big projection screens but are hard to see from aboveStandard Pittsburgh sports bar Food is decent if unspectacular Pens game drink specials are goodThe bar itself is great but this is probably not the right place to go to just for lunch or dinner I had the BBQ bacon burger and it was pretty good but it is all bar food so options are limited That being said I still recommend Caron City to watch the games The ambiance is good and the crowd is generally friendly Service is not consistent but that is to be expected at a barThis is oddly enough an appetizer review We went here last night for the Biggies Bullies fundraiser and it was our first time at Carson City It was crowded downstairs and kind of overwhelming between the people everywhere and the noise We went up to the rooftop and it was so much more quiet and there were TVs tables and a bar up there so it was perfect Since we donated to the fundraiser we got 3 off all appetizers and thank god for that 8 for a chicken finger app Um sorry but no We wanted the buffalo chicken dip and loaded fries but the broiler was broken so we couldnt get either We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip pierogies and chicken quesadillas The spinach and artichoke dip was meh and the chips were MEGA salty Unenjoyably so and it was a huge portion for an appetizer So youre getting your moneys worth anyway The pierogies were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside came with sour cream and very good There were 6 in our order The quesadillas would make an entire meal for one it was again a huge portion for an appetizer They were packed with chicken cheese and bell peppers and came with more cheese delicious salsa sour cream and lettuce to put on top They were really good We didnt try the dinner menu since we were trying to save some money and it was a bit pricey but 2 of our 3 appetizers were good Out waitress was attentive and was able to put our drinks and food on different tabs with no problemOverall head for the rooftop which is covered and heated in winter and much quieter than the scene downstairs in the evening"

    "review":"There are some serious management problems at this Qdoba I live nearby and go here often but only because I prefer it to the Chipotle next door and get a free drink as a college student The line will get very long and the staff takes forever compared to Chipotle Also I went in once and the person at the counter said nothing the entire time and instead awkwardly pointed at things The place is always not as clean or put together as Chipotle and I think this particular store suffers because of it The line for Chipotle is always out the door while here it slows down so much that people leave Please hire at least 2 or more people for the rush timesLove it here The only Qdoba I end up visiting just because I like the people who work here so much The food is always consistently good and the service is always quick I love their craft 2 option No complaintsNot veggie friendly so Ive always liked Qdoba better than Chipotle which happens to be right next door to them but Ill definitely go to Chipotle from now on Normally I grab food on my way to work in the evening  but today I stopped in around 3pmwhat a difference I ordered a vegetarian burrito and get this they charge for an extra scoop of lettuce This extra charge is not listed on the menu and its a vegetarian burrito what else would you put in it Chipotle has tofu Qdoba does not I did not get the grilled veggies on it because they are always salty and normally I just get a lot of lettuce on it beside the rice and beans Now it is not like I wanted a bowl of lettuce just 1 extra scoop and yes there is a charge for that I have never been  charged extra at any other Qdoba nor at this store in the evening for lettuce What made it even more surprising is this extra charge is not listed on the menu  So when asked for a customer service number to file a complaint she kept insisting I call the survey number on my receipt to speak to a live persontotal lie no live person just a recording so I ask her for a store manager or a districts manager s name and she claims there isnt one that they are between district managersFinally I gave up and searched online  found a customer service number where an actual personal answered got a store and a district managers name and a promise of a return call Being charged extra for something  like lettuce bothers me but being lied to is unacceptable  I couldve dealt with just filing a complaint about the lettuce charge and went on with my day but being lied to is terrible customer service Next time I will just go to Chipotle where they dont charge for lettuce and the employees are nicerFirst qdoba is delicious Second this particular location has free parking which is odd for a place in the city So it gets half the stars just for that The qdoba in Oakland has zero parking Third its right next to a chipotle in case you change your mind between parking and ordering Finally qdoba has quesso its delicious and the only reason I go We can all agree that both chipotle and qdoba are magnificent and we dont need all this hate and vitriol in the burrito eating community Burritos come from a place of love2 words Taco Tuesday  This isnt advertised that well and who could blame them when I walked in and ordered 7 different soft tacos with chips salsa and guacamole for 13 Every Tuesday all day long  Qdoba offers 139 tacos You can get hard or soft sell and any kind of meat except steak  I recommend the chicken  Their salsas are always fresh and the guacamole is delicious The staff was friendly and they are quick with your order  If you want a quick cheap and tasty takeout place this is the place to goTypical Qdoba location set up is almost exactly the same as other location  What set this one apart from the other locations is that it was able to handle the influx flow of customers that seemed to form a line to the doorThey worked efficiently to make the food as fast as they could  The guy in the kitchen area was what really made them go so fast  It was like he knew what was going to be going out soon and had it sitting there waiting for them when they were about to turn around  The lady at the head of the line made it a smooth process too  She had everything set up and was on to the next personOne of the major things that I dont like is that it seems that the portion sizes have gone down since my last endeavor to a Qdoba  I got a naked burrito and the bowl it was in seems to have shrunk  I was still kind of hungry afterwards"

    "review":"We received a flyer in the mail today and figured wed give it a go This is by far hands down the best pizza we have had since we moved back to Pittsburgh We have deffinetly found our new pizza shop We ordered a large 12 cut pepperoni pizza whole steak hoagie an 12 garlic parm wings  2500 wreusable coupon  Everything was just perfectly cooked delivered hot and just awesome Cant wait to order againTypical Pittsburgh pizza delivery joint with one exception the sandwiches are enormous A whole sub is easily a filling meal for two My only complaint is that they use buffalo fries similar to Arbys fries but waffle not curly on their buffalo chicken sandwich Not enough chicken and too many fries The pizza is great Must be the same folks as Venice pizzeria because the menus and quality are identicalThe search for good hoagies in the South Hills might finally be over Ordered the two hoagie special out of their flyer  a steak and a buffalo chicken Both were delicious I do wish they put lettuce and tomato on the buffalo chicken but its forgivable The chicken and fries were crispy and not drowned in buffalo sauce which I appreciated Ranch dressing on the side was a nice touch to keep the bread from getting soggy The steak was great too the lettuce hadnt wilted under the heat and the peppers and onions still had a bit of bite to them Express uses Mancinis bread for their hoagies and it makes such a difference in quality Delivery was surprisingly quick considering the snow Ill definitely be ordering from here again  looking forward to seeing if the pizza is as good as the hoagiesI ordered from grubhub and they said an hour to hour and 15 mins for delivery but I got it about 30 mins after I placed my order So fast delivery  I got a buffalo chicken pizza and it was so good It have trouble finding one that is spicy and theirs is Also tons of cheese and buffalo fries You have to open your mouth real wide to get a bite I also ordered cheesecake and wasnt to happy about those I didnt expect them to be homemade or anything but the strawberry one came frozen The top had ice particles on it and I couldnt get a piece off  Luckily the person I got it for wasnt home to eat it right away so it could defrost The oreo cheesecake came fine though I guess they dont sell a lot of strawberry so they keep it in a freeze and the oreo in a fridge If the strawberry one wasnt frozen I would have give 5 stars and Ill try other itemsMy boyfriend and I ordered from this place via grubhub almost 2 hours ago We were incredibly excited about all of the positive reviews and ordered steak hoagies After waiting 30 minutes past the estimated wait time of one hour and still not receiving a text saying our food is on the way my boyfriend called the restaurant The guy who answered the phone was rude and insisted he had called to tell us they dont deliver to our area even though were only 3 miles away and it has our area as a delivery area and no one answered the phone and since it was my phone he supposedly called my boyfiend handed the phone over to me I explained that I did not recieve a phone call and that my phone had been in front of me the entire time At that point he decided to switch his story and say that he called grubhub and it was their fault To those that use grubhub you know that when you or a restaurant have an issue with an order you contact them or they contact you directly Upon hanging up with him and talking to the nice lady at grubhub I learned that he never actually contacted grubhub either They were perfectly okay with letting us sit here hungry all night waiting for food that would never come The customer service is why theyre getting one star  I dont care if the food tastes like it was made by Jesus himself I will never eat here"

    "review":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon with my father for lunch  I had been to Peppis before but it was many years previous and at their North Side location  This location has a counter where you order off to the left as soon as you walk in  The rest of the restaurant is composed of a number of different tables and booths lots of wood and earthy colors and has some decorations consisting of Pittsburgh sports and Peppis regularsBoth my father and I decided to get a regular Italian hoagie on this day and they were brought to our table within 10 minutes of us ordering  The sandwich itself looked pretty good and consisted of genoa salami rosa salami capacola and provolone cheese all on a nice bun that was just short of a foot  I also decided to go with the lettuce onion and dressing that was offered to me but said no to the tomato Overall I thought that the taste of my sub was pretty good although I wouldnt have guessed that there was two kinds of salami and some capicola in it  The bread may have been my favorite part of the sandwich as it seemed to be rather fresh  I could also see some people complaining about the bread to filling ratio here as there seemed to be a lot more bread than filling but personally I was ok with itThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future  The price was right and my sub was decent so why wouldnt II love Peppis For my money theres no sub spot in Pittsburgh Id rather go I find myself coming to this location a lot as the Strip District is convenient That being said I have several gripes about this location as opposed to the North Side one I also frequentThe staff There is a fine line between snarky funny sarcastic attitudes and well being rude While its not always the case when I come here days like today rub me the wrong way I know how to order and refusing to acknowledge that Im at the counter and joking with each other that Im waiting is not funny to me Who knows maybe Im being dramaticAnd it has become a reoccurring problem here that they forget to bring the French fries which means your sandwich is cold by time they come or you eat your sandwich and wait and are no longer hungry for friesThat being said the food is still delicious The location is just as rustic as all of the other spots But if you want a more pleasant experience is recommend the North Side locationExcellent service and my 7 Roethlisberger was amazing  Fresh bread and perfectly cooked sausage  The staff was very friendly and helpful in making my selection  I cant wait to go backMy husband and I went here for lunch based on the recommendation of the guy manning the parking lot and the guy that was pulling in to park and it was the best recommendation weve ever received I got the Ultra Cheesesteak and my husband tackled The Roethlisburger We also ordered a large order of cheese fries The fries seem hand it and the cheese to dip them in is the perfect mix of salty and cheesy The real standouts however were the sandwiches First of all they are HUGE They come with lettuce tomato and mayo My hubby and I are firm believers in not messing with the way people suggest you eat things so we got our sandwiches with everything they recommended The meats on both sandwiches were so tender and flavorful The cheesesteak was the best sandwich Ive ever had My husband loved the 7 so much that he ate until he was overfull It was a tiny bit spicy and so very good Dont miss Peppis It is perfectionWanted to go out to breakfast in the Strip but the lines at each diner were just too long Worked out well because we enjoyed Peppis for the first time at about 11:30 AM Solid crowd at the tables but not packed and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of timeStraightforward menu order at the counter where you get a great shot of the guys on the grill  Take a ticket to your table and the runner brings your food out and calls your number I got the New Yorker steak provolone american onions bacon and did not add lettuce tomato or mayo and it was amazing Perfectly melted and delicious My friend got the tuna melt with LTM and had no complaints 20 for both of us including drinks and a 2 tipGreat local place will be back again for lunch in the StripGreat subsgreat stories I love this place and one of my go too places when I am starving and feel like eating a great sub Lots of options I classify Peppis and Primantis both in my old world Pittsburgh food places Places I love to reminisce and places Id love to always return It may be blue collar but dont let that deter you if you are that kind to be easily dissuade Remember Pittsburghs roots"

    "review":"This place deserves 5 stars for their delicious pizza I havent tried any of the other items on the menu and probably never will because I found what I was looking for a nice big slice of NY pizza My only complaint is that the tables and floor are always dirty I dont usually eat there but it would be nice if the place looked cleanerThis place has some of the best pizza in the Pittsburgh area I love the lunch specialsSometimes youre just in the mood for eating something greasy preferably with cheese  Maybe you also feel like finishing it off with some liquid sugar that is carbonated  If so look no further than Italian Village Pizzas amazing 5 and change deal which consists of two NY style cheese pizza can add toppings for marginal fee and a fountain drink  The pizza is well cooked is tasty and hot with decent crust  Add some banana peppers to that thing and youre rollin  Like I said good but not special  Great value  Ill be back when Im in the moodI asked for toppings on their cheese only special 2 slices  16oz drink and they literally just threw fresh green peppers on a prebaked cheese slice and put it in an oven for awhile I wont go there againAfter a long day at work my sister and I decided to go home order a pizza and try to relax We put in a call to the closest pizza place we could find in the hope that it would arrive somewhat quickly We were quoted an hour wait but decided to go for it An hour and a half later our pizza finally arrived and we hungrily dug in only to discover that there was no sauce on it Now it is quite probable that it was not intended to have sauce but if that was the case it seems only fair that there should have been a warning on the menu description since one orders a pizza expecting that it should indeed contain sauce At this point we were so hungry that the only solution we had was old barbecue sauce  which by the way was a horrible combination So although technically the pizza saved us from starvation it was pretty disappointing in the taste department In the interest of fairness I could give a more accurate review if I tried a pizza that actually had sauce on it but for now Ill probably try other places when in desperate circumstancesI got a pizza from here and it was downright awful It was very dry and there was little to no sauce The cheese almost tasted old as well It might have been because it was on Saint Pattys Day however the store did not look busy and I came to pick it up I certainly would not consider this pizza place as there are many many better options"

    "review":"I stopped by here a few days ago and tried their breaded wings and again tonight for their naked wingsThe hot buffalo sauce is pretty darn good and its about the closest thing to my hometowns version of hot wings which I had missed a lot Its a small little restaurant and easy to miss but a must see if you want some good wings Also love the tator tots and garlic breadI just returned home with my takeout order of tenders and popcorn chicken and saw a public hair inside the popcorn chicken container As if this wasnt bad enough we called and asked for a refund of the popcorn chicken and the order taker called the owner and the owner would not refund the money unless we brought the food back I would recommend going anywhere else This place is disgusting and the owner is obviously an assholeAs a student in the area tenders is extremely convenient and used to be one of my top lunch choices seriously 23 times a week however I stopped in this week to find out that they completely changed their menu They removed all Cuban items from their menu and the pictures on here are no longer menu options They also removed a large number of their sandwiches and dinners so all thats left are the greasy fried tender meals and some mediocre Asian food on a street that already has 4 other established Asian restaurants mind you If it remains this way I do not foresee myself or the group of people that I always went with ever eating here againI got the 4piece tenders meal with honey mustard and paid a little extra for sweet potato fries as the side It came with a piece of buttered garlic bread It was the perfect amount of food Chicken tenders and sweet potato fries are pretty much my chosen comfort foods so Im glad I found a place close to my work where I can get both of those items as a meal I called ahead to order and it was ready in 510 minutes The person who answered the phone and cashed me out was friendly I would have never thought to go here but I read some okay reviews and decided to give it a shot Ill definitely come back for the tendersDont get a Cuban veggie wrap It falls apart and is not very good Probably would be difficult to do well but this did not come close Maduros were pretty goodThis is a fairly new place which replaced a mediterranean style restaurant about 2 months ago I had previously gone to the said mediterranean restaurant so when this popped up I was curious and gave it a tryUpon entering the restaurant one discovers a fairly unassuming casual atmosphere The people behind the counter are quick to greet you and friendly so that is a plus After looking at the menu which is half Cuban style food and sandwiches and half Chicken I decided on the cuban sandwichThe sandwich did not disappoint as it was flavorful and the portion was large It was a bit greasy but what else can you expect from a paninigrilled Cuban sandwich I would do it again when Im in the mood for something not exactly healthy I have not yet had the chance to try anything from the chicken portion of the menu"

    "review":"Everest is an authentic Nepali restaurant that specializes in both traditional Nepali food and Indian food  My wife and I have been here twice and have stuck with the Nepali dishes  We were not disappointed  After trying both chicken momos and veggie momos we decided that we prefer chicken momos fried  you can also have them steamed  Ordering chau chau veg or chicken is a must on our list and we also enjoyed the thukpa  This place is owned and staffed by Nepalis The owner both cooks and serves tables  He is starting out and is putting out a great product eventually other logistics will come together and I am sure will warrant a 5th star  On a final note make sure to get the milk tea chaiJuly 6th 2014  My first taste of Nepali dish at a Nepali Restaurant in Pittsburgh PA after living in the city for more than a decade Any my experience was just AOK We were driving back from Ohiopyle from a long weekend of hiking and biking  when we decided to stop here for dinner The restaurant sitting area and a party hall was being vacuumed as we walked in I was told that a wedding party had just ended but the restaurant was still open for business The restaurant has more of a cafeteriadinner settings with a row of corner boothsNow comes the mouth watering part  which we were hoping for Since its supposed a Nepali Ethnic Restaurant we chose to order only Nepali dish We were a group of five  so we ordered the Non Veg Thali for 2 chicken and mutton chicken chowmein Chicken Momo and Chicken curry with Rice Apparently they were out of Chicken Momos so we got the Veg Momo instead Everything seemed fresh and the Manager assured that everything was cooked fresh and from scratch Theres also several Indian Dish on the Menu which was a lot cheaper compared to the Nepali Dish which I can understand but the Thali in my opinion seemed a bit high As a Nepalese and having cooked and tasted Nepali Dish myself  the food here was okay and authentic to some extendEveryone working here was very friendly and the service was pretty good My recommendation to fellow yelpers if you happen visit this place  stick to the Nepali DishThe food here was very fresh and tasty I recommend ordering from the menu because the buffet while fresh and delicious has a much smaller selection than many are used to finding at say an Indian Restaurant buffet The food is really very very good and I do recommend them if youd like a flavorful dish I found the menu to be very much what I often see at an Indian restaurant perhaps I need to educate myself further but I had thought that perhaps there would be some Tibetan food that I was unaware ofDelicious dinner Fresh spicy and pippin hot Friendly staff and definitely coming back to venture into new items on the menu The man who placed our food on the table was so nice I loved the way he gently placed our utensils into our bowl of food I dont know it was just so kind and lovely : The restaurant had several ethnic men hanging out and one of them was very helpful with explaining some items on the menu Overall nice experience and Im glad its close to homeExcellent food  We enjoyed the Mutton soup lamb curry and mutton chow mein noodles  We will definitely be returningJune 2015 edit: We went there on a Saturday evening  There were 2 other tables of people there  The wait time was outrageous  Didnt get drinks for 45 minutes  We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and the first one didnt come for an hour even though the other 2 tables go their apps  I didnt even get to eat my entree because by the time it came we had already been there for 2 hours and we had to leave so we could get my son to bed  The mango juice was watered down this time  The food was still excellent but the service was so slow that it ruined the experience for me this time so I had to drop the rating by a star  Well go again but if the service is this slow again I dont know if I can continue to go hereSooooo delicious  I have been back three times and each time is better  Both the Indian and the Nepalese options are great  I loved the chow mein the momos the samosas and especially the spinach paneer  Service is excellent and the food is obviously homecooked  51 needed some good South Asian food and this is it"

    "review":"Although I have not yet been able to try the food I feel than an update to my original review is appropriate After learning of my subpar experience the event coordinator reached out to me to apologize and assure me that she would take the appropriate steps to correct the underlying issues She was contrite and seemed to be genuinely concerned with my bad experience In my opinion customer service is as important as price quality and atmosphere Mistakes happen and every one of us has bad days Its how a restaurant corrects those mistakes that separates a good restaurant from a great restaurant I am now convinced that my experience was an isolated incident rather than a regular occurrence I will definitely return to Easy Street in the near future and will recommend the restaurant to family and friends Im hoping that their food is as good as their customer service If that turns out to be the case Ill likely update my review to 5 starsI always go to their pizza placetake out counter for lunch The food is great but they are really slow with getting your food out I feel like there is a major miscommunication with the young lady working the register and the man making the foodRecently stopped in on a Friday night before a Bucco game Service was painfully slow Once the food finally did arrive  after about an hour it was decent enough but we had to scarf it down like a pack of wolves in order to get out of there in time to make it to the game Its an okay place Just dont go there if youre in any kind of a hurryI miss DingbatsThis review is for their express open for lunch Eric the chef is the person that holds this all together  He knows all the regulars and their special orders  Sometimes you can see him start the persons order before they even place it  For downtown quick lunch this is one of the best options in Pittsburgh  Large slices of pizza or pepperoni rolls for 3 It doesnt matter what type of pizza you get its all good  Occasionally he switches the pepperoni roll to a steak roll  If you see that buy it  You will not be disappointed  I try to go their every time Im in the areaWell as I noted they changed the menu along with the prices Some of the items remained intact but other things were swapped outFor instance you can no longer get pizza until after 4:00 That had been a good take home meal for family Most items are ala carte but if you order a sandwich you can pair it with chips fries or cole slaw They do have a portabello mushroom sandwich which I will try next time the occasion merits itThey do offer now a nice spinach salad with toppings and you can add chicken for a slight up charge Again this is not a place I normally visit except when I am meeting someone for lunchService can be slow at timesYesterday we had to wait 15 minutes for our lunch and my girlfriend had to be back at work  I think their Wi Fi has gotten worse so I normally turn it off to get receptionI have never come here during the busy lunch hours  happy hour is my time of day I always come with coworkers because it is the only bar area in the Oxford Centre that we can go to we work at the other We come maybe once or twice a month Their food is okay I usually eat the nachos or spinachartichoke dip Both are delicious and filling for the price Their wine selection is terrible so I end up drinking something on draft whatever the special isThis place isnt terrible for the occasional downtime after work but if it disappeared I wouldnt miss it"

    "review":"I came here Saturday evening yesterday and seeing that there were several seats available at the bar I took one and sat down The bartender approached me and asked me what I would like I said just a glass of water She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no Im fine She gave me a disgruntled look and walked away Shortly after another bartender approached me and asked me if I wanted anything and I said I was okay He said would you like a menu Feeling a little guilty I agreed to take one but said I ate earlier He then asked if I had any intention of ordering anything I said I wasnt sure and then I offered to give up my seat if more people came after which he then left I immediately got off my seat and left the establishmentI cant recall anytime in recent history being treated like that While I respect the need for establishments to make money and to attract paying customers it did not sit well with me that I could not even sit down at their bar and relax for a few moments with a drink of water On plenty of occasions Ive gone to other establishments and not been hassled over ordering water If treated nicely or if the bar was crowded I would tip when given water or would order something since I do understand their business needs However treating a potential customer like a vagrant off the street and not offering any initial hospitality is not a wise business model This form of treatment makes them feel insulted and not only discourages them from becoming paying customers but encourages them to write negative reviews and to share their story word of mouth to anyone who will listenIf management is so adamant that every person entering their establishment is a paying customer then they must make it into a policy that is clear to incoming patrons This can be done by putting up signs and also by training personnel to respectfully inform patrons of this policy when they sit at the bar Digressing if the bar was crowded and if I continued to order water then I could see their pointOne other point I should make is that I had just spent 60 at Casbah the adjacent restaurant which if I understand correctly is operated under the same management Regardless no incoming patron deserves to be treated like a deadbeat Any successful business model incorporates courtesy respect hospitality and the crazy notion that any incoming patron has the potential to become a repeat customer if they are treated right From the treatment I received I can see that either no such model exists for this establishment or the hiring or training regimen is in need of some TLC The experience I had infuriated me and short of a sincere apology I will never go back and will share this experience with othersBirthday Gobblerito It was so wrong yet so right Like being with a woman you know you shouldnt be with but damn it you can spare the eventual heart break for the momentary bosom of her warm love That my friends is the Gobblerito Minus one star for awkwardly loud acousticsI am ridiculously ashamed that in all my years in this fair city of Pittsburgh and my three years Yelping I have yet to review this fine establishment  I suppose the Shadyside location is among the more recent additions to the Mad Mex crew so maybe I get a pass  ANYWAY  Mad Mex is just fabulouseven moreso in the fall when the allimportant Gobblerito takes centerstage and fills my belly with an entire Thanksgiving meal swaddled in a delightful flourly shell  Aside from the Gobblerito MM has plenty to offer yearround include those of us who love a good vegetarian meal when theyre not scarfing down turkey by the pound  MMs menu is a delight to every TexMex palate and their wings arent too bad either  Throw in a great beer list and the best margaritas north of Mexico City and youve got a true Pittsburgh favorite Pass the guacamole pleaseMy friends and I had our Gobblerita friendsgiving at the Shadyside location  The food was great  My gobblerita and margaritas were exactly why we went there  The service on the other hand was sub par  We went at an odd time around 4 pm with nearly no one in the usually busy place:  Right after lunch right before HH  We sat in the bar and seemed to be a bother until our waitress was on her shift  I go out to eat often and the service makes or breaks the experience  I will try again soonI think Mad Mexs food is a bit overrated but the magaritas on happy hour special are a good deal and tasty  The beer menu is awesome  Expensive but excellent selection  The Shadyside location is spacious and comfortableI love their black bean dip and accordingly the black bean and pineapple quesadilla  Much of the other food Ive had here is pretty Meh and definitely Mexican inspired rather than close to anything authentic or even authentically TexMexy  The chips and salsa make me downright hostile because a they are expensive b the texture is too thick and they taste as they came directly out of a supermarketbought Tostitos bag and c they are often somewhat stale so its more like that Tostitos bag was bought and left open 2 weeks ago Gross  The Gobblerito is indeed a thing of Seasonal Beauty  If you dont mind the resulting carbcoma it is definitely something to tryOur favorite family dining choice  Delicious gluten free fish tacos and lots of dairy free and gluten free options as well  Kids meals are a good value  Margaritas delish

    "review":"My friends and I chose to go during a Ronald McDonald House fundraiser where part of the bill went to the foundation during brunch hours If a portion of my bill however had not gone to charity I probably would have refused to pay Upon arrival we were not greeted by any staff seated or instructed to seat ourselves We stood at the front of the restaurant confused for a few minutes when someone from Ronald McDonald even remarked that the restaurant wasnt prepared for the small crowd It wasnt very packed at all and 8 of us sat down without waiting Despite the restaurant only being moderately busy it took nearly twenty minutes for a server to even come introduce herself and bring us water She claimed she was late and no one told her this was her table yet in the time before she showed up no one else on staff acknowledged us We finally ordered and spent close to an hour waiting for our food When it arrived only five of eight plates were brought out Since the wait was so long those five began eating About ten minutes later the rest of us asked why we hadnt received our food at which time our server ran back and immediately brought the last three plates out It was cold It was quite obvious that three plates of food were left sitting in the back during that time I ordered a Reuben and tater tots There were about six tater tots on my plate and the Ruben was barely cooked There were two tomatoes on one side of the sandwich and none on the other so I could never get a full bite of everything The bread felt stale and overpowered everything else that was messily thrown into my plate My friend remarked that her eggs Benedict were cold and not the runny consistency they should have been The presentation of all the plates was terrible One friend was given a side of scrambled eggs that barely filled half of the large plate they were on Im typically a big food instgrammer but there was nothing on our table that looked appetizing enough to even want to think about taking a picture of When we finished eating it took another twenty minutes to take our plates and bring checks Then another ten minutes to run our cards All in all we were at the restaurant for over two hours for a meal that wasnt filling wasnt prepared well and was served with poor service Our waitress never smiled thanked us begrudgingly and ignored us most times she passed the table The place was understaffed unprepared and frankly a morning ruiner Sunday brunch should be a relaxing enjoyable experience surrounded by friends not the start to a bad day If I had to describe Dive Bar in one word it would simply be: abysmalDive is exactly the sort of place Upper Lawrenceville was lacking before Its a chilled out bar by night and a clean fairly calm place to grab lunch or dinner during the day Given the shortage of diners and weekend lunch places on this stretch of Butler Street I was very glad when it opened Ive been here for late Sunday lunch dinner and takeout multiple times The service is always fast and very friendly and the food never disappoints The burgers are handformed with lots of toppings to choose from and reasonably priced for the size and quality Ive also had the fish  chips which was quite delicious and my boyfriend swears by their wings Additionally the draft list is always surprisingly diverse and quite reasonably priced I tried a Kentucky bourbon barrel aged ale on my last trip here So good Ill be back to Dive again soon Im certain Its a sure bet for a good meal in a relaxing environmentHuge And Im not just talking about just portion sizes The menu at Dive is enormous and full of options You would think with that large of a menu some of the items would be a miss but Ive tried items in almost all categories quite a feat and they are all hitsMy favs include the grilled romaine Caesar salad and the bowls fries or chips topped with different veggies meat and cheeses And the brunch menu adds even MORE options for you to choose from including a mini funnel cake for 3 bucks that is the perfect size to shareDive has a plentiful draft and cocktail list Be warned Dive has a small dining room and some slightly surly wait staff The value and variety here always keeps me coming back thoughWent here for the first time last night on a whim and was impressed I only got the fried pickles even though I wanted everything on the menu but they were some of the best Ive ever had The batter was different than most but delicious and their ranch seemed to have a light dill flavor to it which I enjoyed Service was kind of slow but it was busy I cant wait to come back to DiveA great addition to our neck of Lawrenceville  I generally work late and hit this place on my way home The staff is always friendly and certainly not bitter about a late order which I really appreciate The food is solid for bar food and Ive had a pretty decent variety of things off their menu Good burger Good fish sammich Good fries Definitely glad to have this place in the neighborhoodReally nice bar area and super beer selection  Food was really decent  Macho Man Reuben was executed well  not overly heavy on the corned beef nor the cheesekrautslaw mixture  Very nice flavor profile and not your typical heavy Reuben I am not ashamed to say I ate the entire thing including the delicious sweet potato tots with that yummy cinnamon butter  Three of us split a Southern Comfort Crazy Dilla that was really delicious  The prices are reasonable and the service was good"

    "review":"Ordered the green curry  it was very good The only reason I did not give it a fivestar rating was the spice level I indicated that I wanted very little  as in almost no  spice  It was probably more like a 3 on a 05 scale when I was envisioning more like a 1  In the future I will just be sure to indicate that more precisely Overall the food was great the service was very good my husband was happy with what he ordered also and the dessert and drinks were also very tasty35 stars if I could and I plan to revisit to reevaluate the heat scaleLarge menu fair prices and generous portions Loved the spring rolls So far so goodBut their heat scale is a bit off from what I am used to I am normally happy at a 45 out of 10 for Thai food at all the places in the city So when I ordered by dinner I asked for a 4 but was told they use a scale from 0 to 5 rather than 0 to 10 Falling back to my undergrad Engineering math courses I calculated that half of four is two so I went with the two on the spice levelWell to quote Jessie in Toy Story IISweet Mother of Abraham Lincoln  I was unable to get past a few forks of my curry I tried shaking the sauce off each piece smothering it with rice and even tried beer and Coca Cola but I quickly gave up and finished the rice while sweat ran down my face I declined a takeout boxWhat I dont know is if this was a mistake or normal  But if this is really what their two is supposed to be I cannot imagine what a 5 would have beenI always get the fish with chili paste when I go and it never fails When Im craving Asian cuisine and Im too lazy to cook theyre always first on my list Super friendly and attentive staff as wellWe have been wanting to try out this Thai place down the road from us for awhile now and I will say it did not disappoint last night  We have been looking for a decent Thai places in the South Hills and I think we found our favorite spot We started with the pork dumplings as our appetizer and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing so much flavor  My husband got the pad thai with shrimp at level 5 we like spice and he said it was much better than our original favorite spot in the city  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with tofu at a level 3  It was spicy but a great flavorful spice  The portion sizes were large so if you are looking to eat a lot of good Thai this is the place  We will absolutely be back there soonTheir pineapple fried rice and The My Thai salad are the best ever Highly recommendWeve visited 3 times now and will definitely dine there as a regular stop  Curries are amazing  Service is exceptional"

    "review":"So I called to make reservations for lunch at Bella Serra in Market Square and discovered upon my arrival that they were now SiennaThe good news:  great location some nice outside seating and a fairly small indoor area that has a nice rustic Italian feel  The bad news: service was a little slow during lunch and it took forever for someone to take our order  Also I ordered the margherita flat bread  It was piled high with finely chopped basil which I love but the edges of the crust were way overcooked and impossible to cut through let alone bite through while the center of the flat bread was way too soggy   They seemed to use canned or at least marinated tomatoes  As a result there was a ton of sauceliquid which made the bread so soggy in the middle  I think they would have been way better off with thinly sliced fresh tomatoes  Having said this Id like to go back and try something else off the menu to see if that is any better  The styling on the plates of the other guests looked appealing and it looked like a good wine list  Im thinking I may just have ordered the wrong thingI am completely sold on Sienna I dined late on a Friday night with the significant other The atmosphere is very intimate and romantic perfect for our little date night We were promptly greeted and had our drink orders taken Service was fantastic throughout our meal The real star of the show was the food though oh the food I am beyond particular about Italian food in Pittsburgh If Im going to order pasta I was it to blow me away The food at Sienna knocked my socks off We started with the Octopus and it was prepared deliciously The sauce that accompanied it was just as delicious The only thing that threw us was the beans that it was served with Neither of us particularly liked them but at the rest of the dish emphatically Next we had our entrees we both had pasta I had the bolognese and my partner had the rustic gemelli Both were out of this world  I loooooved the sauce in the gemelli and the bolognese had the perfect portion of meat and sauce The noodles were fresh and cooked to perfection All in all I cannot wait to come back Im already dreaming of the dayMy fianc and I had our anniversary dinner here and unfortunately we were very unhappy with everything we tried We ordered the octopus for our appetizer which had very bitter vegetables and sauce My sangria tasted very fresh but there was a strong mint tone to it that I did not enjoy They serve their bread with a creamy spread that reminded me a little of refried beans It was unusual but had a nice taste fianc hated it I would prefer dipping oil This is not the place to come if you want simple classic Italian food Their entrees are all ruined by the bitter veggies and sauces and the vegetarian options are sparse I ended up getting the four cheese flatbread which was very greasy and had a nice crisp to the crustif you only ate the edges Fiancs prosciutto wrapped salmon was undercooked in the middle and sitting in a pool of disgusting red sauce that he said ruined the entire dish Not to mention tables are so close together that you can hear everyones conversation Was a disappointing choice for our anniversary dinner but the one plus is that the service was great and our server knew the menu extensivelyIt was a warm sunny early April day  we enjoyed sitting in the outdoor space The mushroom pizza was the delicious Try it if you like mushroomsI dont get it This place gets writeups and great reviews and I cannot for the life of me see why  The food is mediocre  Some of the combinations on the menu look innovative but in practice there is a lot of stuff on the plate that doesnt really add to the flavor of the dishes  My agnolotti didnt need 7 kinds of vegetables accompanying it when they were all mushy and flavorless  The service is worse  Our waiter was astoundingly condescending and unfriendly explaining what tapas are and what bolognese sauce is  I guess we look like we think our idea of great Italian food is Pizza Hut   and slowit took on average 15 minutes to get each drink not because the bar was busy but because he was standing at the end of it BSing  The price of the meal was not in line with the amount or quality of the food we received  In sum this place is thriving in a downtown area with otherwise great restaurants when it is on the level of a pretty good place in a far suburb  For exceptional Italian food walk 150 feet across Market Square and go to Il PizzaioloBrilliant ambience The layout of the restaurant allows for either a quiet meal or socializing with a group since there are 2 distinct sections Servings are quite large Well crafted meals good wine selection too"

    "review":"Right soFirst off hire employees that actually appreciate having a job  Not ones that are there because they are forced to  That way maybe you can actually earn a decent review  If you start off with a bad experience with an employee youre not going to get a great reviewI went here midday on a Sunday  Thought that was a great idea especially when I got there and there were no cars in the drive thru  Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there  Finally order and pull around I wait another five minutes  I could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me or if the sit down area inside was packed but there was no one else there but MEId gladly tell yall the employees name that is if where the name is suppose to be wasnt ripped off  All I can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine  I was made to feel like I was interrupting her day and that I should have just went somewhere else to spend my moneyYou know what really puts me in a tizzy yes I just used that word  Leaving the drive thru driving the distance to my house walking into my house sitting down to feed my face and find that part of my order wasnt given to me  enter angry expletives hereI doubt Ill be revisiting this location again Ill drive the further distance from my place the next time Im craving a taco or twoThe drive through service here leaves something to be desired  Not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpyFood is delicious and staff is very prompt  The one thing I absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is  I was completely stunned and amazed when I walked inI was 6 minutes late for breakfast and they gladly made me a breakfast burrito anywayThis is the fullscale taco bell location closest to CMUwhat elseits a taco bell besides from trying to confirm that i was out of my mind when i ordered 10 doritos locos tacos and a locos tacos box the staff here are friendly and make great taco bell tacosThis place continues to be a joke  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse  My order is never right and yet I still gonever again  I officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh"

    "review":"So Burgatory in the Waterfront looks  the same as the other Burgatories in the city but I can tell you there is something better about the food at this location Perhaps the chef I am not sureRegardless this is an excellent burgermilkshake shop Great place to stop while in the waterfrontMy favorite burger place in Pittsburgh Try the Bison burgers They are really good Dont forget to get a shake My favorite is tr caramel pretzel with the mix salty and sweet tasteIt was a little loud for a Saturday pm but when we asked the hostess to turn down the music she did She made a smart remark about it being a part of their thing or whatever to keep the music at an unhealthy decibel level but I really appreciate them doing that Its nice to sit down to a meal and actually talk to other people Though we notice many youngsters stare at their plastic palm pilots  To the meat Burgers were very good One of us had a chicken breast sandwich instead Weirdo We also ordered onion rings which were very good but too expensive for what you received We all substituted fries for chips and it was worth it I am not sure where they get their beef but it isnt the best Ive ever had We get beef from our local butcher which is better but they did a fine job with cooking it  charred on the outside with a pink center and they were generous with the toppings No complaints just happy chomping  Service was decent When we took our time ordering we felt we were forgotten But our server recovered Our food came out quickly No big deal We left happy They have a good selection of beer but its way overpriced I think I will try a shake instead next time or maybe I can sneak a carafe of white wine like my mom used to at Pizza Hut She would ask for a cup of ice To this day she will deny it For a party of three our bill came to 75 including tip but we also had 2 beers Skip the alcohol and it seems reasonably priced for the quantity and qualityThanks again for turning down the music We live in the age of Walkmans when everyone can deafen to their own tunes Or next time I will bring my boom boxThis is an upscale burger place that serves beer  cocktails Our bison burgers were very good  prepared well The homemade chips were dull though  the chocolate milk shake was disappointing because it didnt have much flavor I dont mind paying steep prices for excellent food but this place didnt clear the barLove the place Even has good veggie burgers The best feature is you can customize the way you want your burger to be Always a waiting but you can shop till you get a callBurgers were really good We customized both of our burgers We ordered nachos and their onion rings from their appetizer menu onion rings were huge and really good I think they even had a light layer of cheese in it Nachos were a little soggy They put too much of their sauce in it so by the time we got it all of it was soggy : Plan on a long wait Weekdays and weekends are really busy but I say its worth the wait we waited about an hr  on a Friday  overall a good place and surrounded by a lot of shopping"

    "review":"A good mixed crowd age wise which is nice mostly people who like good food and want a nice dinner out not too fancy but nice enough The free bean dipbread is a nice unique offering The garden side salad was yummy and different than what youd typically get The quinoa puff appetizer was good but nothing compared to the ginormous pork chop on top of goat cheese chive whipped potatoes I got deliciously prepared My hubby got the crab cakes and risotto which was equally as amazing We really were impressed with this place I think it is totally flying under the radar for how solid it is We will definitely be back but hope the menu changes up every once in awhile as there arent a whole lot of options My one suggestion educate your servers about gluten allergies its a pretty common question especially in fine dinging and my server had absolutely no idea what gluten even wasWent there last night Tuesday  They only had two people working the front since it was a Tuesday and restaurant week had ended a couple of days earlier  That was a mistake  There was a large business dinner going on and almost everyone else in the restaurant was there to redeem their Groupon before it expired today 82014  Half of the tables were  being used and the other half  had to be cleared  We had to wait about 15 minutes before they got around to clearing off a table for us however once we got seated the service was at a slow pace but bearable  Have to hand it to the two waitersMenu was limited but interesting Had the pork chop It was HUGE and tasty Ended up taking half of it home  The better half had the crab cakes which were also very good  The white bean dip and bread also very also hit the spotWill go back again to try the other things that interested me  Hopefully the staffing will be better planned the next timeGreat little place in Bloomfield The food was wonderful and the portions were enormous All entrees come with a side salad have the house dressing and bread with a white bean dip I ordered the pork chops and my partner ordered the crab cakes  we both loved our food and took half our meals home to save room for the peanut butter and jam creme brle and flamed bananas  so good Service was a little slow but that is my only complaintOh its byob and the corkage fee is only 2 bucks Wonderful for a date nightFor a motherdaughter date night I took my mother here last night and it was one of the best meals I have eaten in quite some time We had 6:45 reservationshowever they were not very crowded and we could have been seated easily even if we did not have reservations AlthoughI did notice everyone who came in after us also had reservations My mother and I brought 2 bottles of wine and were charged 4 a piece as it was a 2 corkage fee per person per bottlevery reasonable The only negative about our dining experience was the service which was rather sketchy We had an older gentleman who mumbled and was rather hard to understand He rushed us to order saying he wanted to get the menus out of the way for us leading my mother to have to make a split second decision on what to order The table for 2 we sat at was rather cramped however the table to our right was open the entire time so it was not too invasive The food was spectacular The complimentary white bean hummus with balsalmic vinegar and red peppers was simply amazing and delicious We had also read reviews prior to dining that recommended the smoked gouda I assure you this is NOT to be missed The smoked gouda is served on a bed of sauted spinach with pestosundried tomato and balsalmic on it Its the perfect size for two Id recommend ordering 2 for a table of 4 As for entrees I ordered the crab cakes which came with remoulade and lemon asparagus risotto The crab cakes were very meaty and the risotto was perfectly creamyjust an exquisite entre My mother chose the duck breast served for a corn scallion hash with a sweetspicy Asian glaze She said it was perfectly cooked and very tasty We were too full for dessert and we had leftovers for the next day Also each entre comes with a side salad thatuniquely includes beets Both my mom and I chose the pineappleblueberry dressing and it was wonderful Our total bill was 66 which is quite inexpensive in my opinion due to the BYOB My mom cant wait to return with my dad who is a huge crabcake fan I cant wait to return in the future as wellWe ordered food for a graduation party The food was wonderful: fresh well seasoned innovative and packaged to travel The staff was friendly and solicitous 5 starsFantastic food Smoked Gouda appetizer was excellent The Swordfish special was cooked perfectly and the combination of flavors superb"

    "review":"If youre above the age of 70 or cant bear the thought of opening a can of jarred spaghetti sauce and boil a few frozen raviolis then this place will do Otherwise do yourself a favor and avoid In dire needs of modernization food and decor wise  I dont understand all the great reviewsThe stuffed breadsticks were phenomenal and HUGE I wish I could find stuffed crust pizza around Pittsburgh that isnt a chain but this fit the bill We could have made a meal out of the breadsticks alone The wedding soup was awesome too I had the shrimp and lobster tail florentine for my entree and loved it Dessert was a snowball cake that was very good with whipped cream icing which I prefer over buttercream All in all a great meal with big portions  I had to take half of my food home and nice service Loved this placeStarted off the meal with fried zucchini which was great  Lightly breaded perfectly fried not greasy at all  It definitely tantalized my appetite and made me excited for what was next  All entrees come with soup or salad and I went for the salad option with the house made Italian dressing  It was good not like ohmygod good but it was your average house salad I skipped out on the bread to save room for dinnerTurns out I should have eaten the bread  I heard it was great and my food waseh  I ordered veal parmigiana  Huggeeee piece of veal pounded nice and thin just how I like it and thinly breaded  However there was basically no sauce on it though there was a generous portion of cheese  The side of pasta was absolutely bad  It tasted how pasta tastes in a chafing dish after 34 hours dry pasty with gelatinous sauce  Way too much oregano in the sauce as well  If you have the slightest hint of heartburn I guarantee that oregano is gonna talk back to you  We ordered a chocolate mousse cheesecake but found out they were out of it  Ordered Limoncello cake which was light and fluffy but basically tasted like something you could buy at Sams ClubDecor was dated  They could not fit one more table or chair in there if the wanted  It was clean and had that hometown feel to it but it definitely didnt serve up any sort of remarkable ambiance  The biggest saving grace was our server  He had been there forever and knew the history of the place got our large groups orders correct and never seemed to sweat it when it got busyOverall I dont think Ill be backMy wife and I dined at DeBlasios Friday 7 June 2013 for the first time in years  Our prior experience was memorable for the wrong reason cigarette smoke which streamed into the dining room from the bar  The latest visit was much betterWe were early for a 7:00 p m reservation and were seated immediately in a nice booth by the courteous and professional hostess  I find the dining room to be spacious comfortable and attractive  I disagree with those who feel that it is badly in need in renovation  It need not change a thing on my accountThe highlight of our meal was the service from young efficient friendly warm and gracious Alexis  She performed a quality check with every course but was not hovering over us  No manager or hosthostess came to the table to inquire about the quality of our mealMy Samuel Adams seasonal brew and my wifes merlot wine were both good and worth the prices 4 and 595 respectivelyThe fresh Italian bread was good  It could have been better had it been served warm and with a container of soft butter rather than hard pats of commercial product in plastic containers that the diner must openOur fried zucchini appetizer was outstanding and fairly priced at 750 for a healthy portion which left some to take home and enjoy  This dish is one of the best in the area and that is saying something in this zucchinicrazed regionMy wife had a mozzarella cheese and tomato salad which was small but goodMy linguine with meat sauce 1295 was an average portion  The pasta and sauce were tasty but there was not much meat in the sauce and the pasta was significantly overcooked and soft not something I would have expected at a restaurant which features Italian foodThe carrot cake was delicious and a reasonable portionOur check was 46 for two  While we enjoyed our evening I believe that for the money we are better off at wonderful Scoglio Greentree just two or three miles awayI think I have dined at DeBlasios for the final time  The restaurant does not respond to questions or respectful criticism despite maintaining a website which provides the ability to communicate  I enjoy DeBlasios pizza and fried zucchini but it is not worth the trouble to travel there for it  Stranegly  pizza is offered only in the small lounge but it can be impossible to secure a table there or to determine how many parties are waiting for one   On a recent visit I believe it was the owner that delivered our fried zucchini to the table  He simply dropped off the dish with nothing pleasant to say no graciousness  If this were my restaurant I would be grateful for every customer and that would show in the manner with which I interact with them  There are few restaurants that offer zucchini as delicious as that of DeBlasios but many which offer outstanding pizza and other dishes  I will dine where my patronage is appreciated and where ownership and management are responsive  DeBlasios is not such a placeMy family and I tried the restaurant for lunch after having been there for dinner many times Very disappointing Slow service and my grandaughters pizza was not made right the first time the waitress said it did not set whatever that means We had to wait another 20 minutes for the little girls pizza with no compensation or real apology Of course by the time it came she could not eat it and we ended up throwing it away No a pleasant experience for lunch Sandwiches had a lot of bread then served with fries it was just too much carbs  Not that tasty"

    "review":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant and in my general top 10 on the planet The Spicy Basil Noodles are to die for When Im back in the 412 I eat here twice a weekIts very cozy inside and while there could be table cloths and more stuff on the walls I never mind You cant find a better cooked Thai meal and amazingly enough for that trait a cheaper one I crave this stuff oftenGiven that this is the closest Thai place to me I have reluctantly gone a few times Always felt like I was getting hardly anything for my money but today was definitely the last time I will ever order food from here I ordered the red curry that I have gotten three other times for takeout For some reason this time I received what can only be called the snack portion of rice and a container half the size I usually get for the curry itself I understand raising prices I dont however think you should raise prices while you simultaneously  cut the portions in halfIn terms of tastequality of the food the place is decent at best Nothing special Try somewhere else with better food and more reasonable prices if youre looking for ThaiI love this place Its a comfort food thing for me Things are surprisingly consistent across visits The staff is attentive and welcoming The food is made from actual cut up food and not so much from a frozen bag of cut up food Its great for lunch its a good quick dinner I like this place so much that Ive been known to go eat dinner there by myself and I dont feel weird about itI love this place Nickys will always be my favorite Thai in Pittsburgh both locations equally great but Thai Me Up is all of a 5 minute drive from my house on the Southside and I love both dining in cool atmosphere or take out which I personally do more often When I have dined in they have had issues with being understaffed one server clearly overwhelmed with an unusually busy Tuesday night but as for the food Ive tried many dishes and they are deliciousStandouts their steamed dumplings are my favorite appetizer done so well their lemongrass soup with mushrooms is fantastic lots of shrooms and if you ask for it to be spicy spicy you will receive As for entrees some of my favorites are the Spicy Sweet and Sour with chicken and Tofu both proteins are always prepared perfectly and the SS sauce is great Eggplant and Basil with spicy ginger sauce and the old Thai stand by Pad Thai is certainly on par with NickysMy friend and I visited Thai Me Up today for lunch When we were seated we were the only customers The server brought over two glasses of ice water When I said I didnt want ice water he said I should have informed him of my preference before to avoid wasting before VERY RUDE I thought given that he didnt come over to our table to seat us prior to bringing the water so how should I have told him Next when he brings the water and ask if we are ready to order my friend says she needs a few more minutes As he is turning around I say excuse me trying to order an appetizer He walks off saying he will come later VERY DISINTERESTED I think I find another and ask for straws and she politely brings them over Then for the finale my entree Pad Thai is sweet beyond belief and has no vegetables After trying to eat I call him over and he claims that this is how they make it and the chef hasfollowed the receipt since he was watching over and walks off I have had Pad Thai at Thai Me Up before and this is not how it tastes or looks Second he was running tasks in front of me so he could not have overseen the chef cooking Bottom line: very very very bad customer serviceI was hesitant as I dont like most of the Thai in Pittsburgh but I was pleased Som tum on the menu automatic Thai cred The rolls were good better than my curry and the som tum was good I liked the menu There were classics and also some creative dishes I will definitely try again"

    "review":"There use to be a Nickys Thai in Verona that I visited regularly  I came here expecting the same  The Won Ton soup was delicious and one of the better versions that I have ever had  The Spring Roll Delux was meh in my opinion  I ordered the Garlic chicken  It was good but nothing to write home about  I was expecting more spiciness with a request of 810 when I ordered  I give this place a high threeIve heard great things about this restaurant since I moved to Pittsburgh years ago and have always wanted to go Ive grown up on Southeast Asian foods my whole life and in my opinion this place was overratedTheir Tom Yum didnt have that perfect blend of spicy sweet and sour that makes it so delicious  but you do get lots and lots of veggies in it My pad see ew also lacked a little in flavor The presentation was very nice and the atmosphere was also great but the flavor was lacking overallThis is one my favorite restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh  I usually go about once every two weeks during lunch You MUST go early in order to get a table Pros: the food is reasonable priced which is about 8 for chickenporktofu There are many dishes that Ive tried and really liked One of them is the sweet and sour dish I was never a big fan of curry but I enjoy their curry selection I would recommend the Massaman curry Its a peanut and coconut base Most of the meals come with soup or salad I usually get the soup which is a ginger base with rice and veggies There is some meat I think its pork The salad is like a summer and light dressing which consists of mango and peanutsCons: the waiting time takes forever during lunch I dislike the seating arrangements since each table is right next to each other which makes you feel as you are sitting right next to the people on your left and right I also do not like how loud that place is If you are meeting friends to catch up do not go there during lunch Its hard to hold a conversation when the noise drowns everything outOn the basis of one visit Nickys deserves the praise Wide array of menu choices Great atmosphere Fine serviceFood was amazing Service and presentation was really good Ordered the chicken with cashew nut stir fry and the boyfriend ordered the Panang curry We also got the vegetable4u entree Would recommend everythingThe steamed veggies are the perfect start to summer However the sticky rice is slightly too sticky they do give you a decent portion though The prices seemed to be different online compared to in house dont rely solely on what you see on your screen  give them a call and they are happy to help"

    "review":"Nice family run spot for lunch if you are in the area  Good service at a decent priceThe place looks like something from the Godfather  old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables The food was cooked well but lackluster I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth On the plus the staff was very nice and very attentive Management  you really need to update the placeWhen trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind I had never been here in all the years of living so very close I was glad I chose this establishment Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the placeCame in here just reading some reviews figured Ill give it a shot they were goodI walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a successSo not knowing what to order because so many things looked yummy he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine OMG DELICIOUSAND he prepared it himselfI definitely highly recommend dining here when in the PittsburghGreentree areaThe reason for 4 starts not 5 the wine choices are lacking but the Red Rock Malbec was nice with the meal And Stephanie the bartender super sweet and makes you feel like youre a regularGreat placeBeen coming here for 30 years or so  Always good food at a good price  Great service  Nice varietyWe checked this place out because it was close to our hotel and it was one of the few nonchain restaurants we saw  The service was very friendly The food was just okay  I ordered the fettuccini alfredo with lump crab and they said the sauce is freshly made in house but it sincerely tasted like it was out of a bottle  It wasnt tastyfresh enough to have been over 20  The salad was just the typical iceberg lettuce salad"

    "review":"I came in tonight for drinks and dinner with a good friend I didnt feel like waiting for a table so I sat at the bar until my friend showed up Immediately I was engaged by a bearded bartender who made me feel totally welcome He promptly made me my drink and provided great company until my friend arrived A female server gave us excellent food recommendations and then another really friendly server with dim sum took the time to explain the food he was serving The pork belly was amazing He went above and beyond in talking about the menu and gave us good company Justin and Collin are awesomeIve dined at Grit  Grace for dinner twice now  Both times I sat at the bar and had a lovely experience  The food was delicious and the service was fast  I ordered the pork face roulade both times because I loved it so much the first time  It was reasonably priced and I would have been full from the sandwich alone however I still ordered more plates because we wanted to try other things  The octopus and steam bun were both really good too  The Brussels sprouts with cheddar sauce was an excellent dim sum  My favorite part by far though was the drinks and dessert I ordered the jungle bird cocktail and the smoked flavor with the pineapple was perfectthe bartender is the man  He recommended the dirt dessert and it is still my boyfriend and Is favorite dessert of all time Will be back for sureGood snacks good drinks Slow and not very friendly service Sat at the bar friday after work with co workers Bartender was nowhere to be found and there was 4 hostess that stood around and did nothing One even came to the bar and poured herself a glass of water What about your customers Then this hipster guy in tattoos and plaid comes out and starts making drinks and takes our order but he was very short with us and was such a know it all Soooo that was kinda of an annoying experience The food and drinks WERE good but there was nothing about that place that was like I HAVE to come backI have written pretty extensive reviews of GG in the past so Ill do my best to keep this short and sweet My boyfriend and I had 8pm reservations and we were seated at one of the long tables right away Our server as always was efficient and friendly My boyfriend being here to visit for the weekend had never been to GG so I made some suggestions based on what I had in the past however the only thing we ordered that I had sampled before were the short ribs on the biscuits which I said was not an option to NOT order haha They were amazingly delicious as always Off the regular menu we also ordered the chicken meatball ramen  one hour egg confit chicken thigh housemade kimchi schmaltz roasted carrots They brought out two bowls and two spoons so we could share the dish I was pretty impressed with the ramen The broth was flavorful and not overly salty the chicken meatballs were flavorful and the chicken thigh was practically meltinyourmouth The size of the portion made it perfect to share since we also were partaking in the dim sum options When the dim sum server came around  we opted for the beef heart empanada with salsa verde The portion size was only one however it was quite large and filled to the brim with beef heart and potatoes Personally I thought the portion size was perfect for sharing We wanted to try the chicken wings as well however there were none available at the time The server had the kitchen make a portion for us and we are so glad we chose to try them There are 3 large wings in the portion which is served with buttermilk ranch the best ranch sauce I have ever had hands down and serrano chille peppers which I gladly let my bf eat since they are far too spicy for me so we each took a wing and then sort of shared the last one The wings we were told were fried in duck fat The skin was so crisp and deliciousthe best wings I have had in quite some time I was very tempted to order another portion but was pretty full at that point Drinks here are still top notch as alwaysI ordered the Postmark Pgh which had White rum Maggies Farm spiced rum wiggle lavender and some other ingredients I cant recall but it was very good I did notice they changed the drink menu since this drink I ordered is not featured on their online menu and the Mai tai which I typically ordered was no longer on the menu My boyfriend ordered a drink with chille infused tequilla and WOW what a spicy kick it had but he enjoyed it very much GG is one of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh excellent food and drinks and I find it is typically never crowded so if you have not already visited GG I recommend paying a visit soonIve been to Grit  Grace twice: Once for dinner and once for lunch  Ive enjoyed both times  Like other reviews have said the pork belly bites are insanely good  I also love the kimchi  a bit on the spicy side for some at my table but I thought it was spot on For lunch I had the crispy tofu  I would give that more of a 35  Some elements were great  the tofu and mushrooms were perfect  There was just too much braised daikon in the end For dinner Ive ordered the scallops and tried the braised goat  I enjoyed the scallops and loved the goat I just wish the goat had been on the lunch menuI went to Grit  Grace during lunch  I liked the overall vibe of the restaurant  I ordered a salad with the roasted carrots and cheese curds  It was definitely unique and I enjoyed it but it didnt stand out as being one of the best salads I ever had   I dined with 4 others  Their dishes seemed to be hit or miss  We also shared some items from the dim sum which were tasty  Id like to try this place for dinner"

    "review":"Interesting convenience store in Wilkinsburg that resembles a former gas stationThings you will find inside: Haninis Subs  I did not look over the menu or see what was going on behind the counter but I do know that they have corned beef sandwiches Overpriced grocery staples Cigarettescigars Snacks sodas and other sugary drinks Candy behind the counters glass Glass pipes  For tobacco use only Hookahs LotteryA hidden gem  This is a Cleveland based company so you know they must have great corned beef  I got a corned beef sandwich and it was fantastic  The sandwich was huge and the meat was fresh  Apparently their gyros are amazing too but I didnt try one  Also yelp has them listed as extremely expensive currently but that is a lie as all of the menu items were under 10 dollars and most of the sandwiches are 6 or 7 bucks  Haninis is in a run down neighborhood so if you are a snob you may want to go elsewhereGood neighborhood market with friendly people Their sandwiches are HUGE and freshly made right in front of youI love there sandwiches  also there chicken  is delicious  also they have a lot of different things in there store the food is  Is excellent also the shortterm to wait for the food the people that work there are friendly its a One Stop Shop they sell a lot of different items at this store but they sell food the price of their food is reasonable they make a corned beef sandwich thats out of this world they put so much corned beef on a sandwich its ridiculous I would recommend two others to come to this MarketThe graffiti on the side of this convenience store in Wilkinsburg PA is what first grabbed my attention when driving by I looked up the business then and read the couple reviews From those I added Haninis to my list of places to try Finally one day my husband and I grabbed a couple sandwiches for lunch There is no place for eating in  takeout only We ordered a pastrami and a corned beef sub Years ago I was hooked on the corned beef sandwiches with a side of potato salad from a small shop on Main Street in Butler I have seldom had a comparable corned beef since then This may be it though I watched as they cut the meat to order for each sandwich There is something great about the taste of freshly sliced meats I added the coleslaw to the corned beef that first visit which made it too messy Other than that everything else was great with these sandwiches The sandwiches were piled high with meat and made with our specified condiments as in any chain sandwich shop but this is not your regular chain sandwich shop This place is cuts above the rest so give it a try You can call ahead so your sandwich is ready for pickup when you arrive I only wish they would add my potato salad to make my meal complete but I am particular about my potato saladsThis is a classic hood store with beastly sandwiches you can get food snacks dvds and smoking accessories  The HUGE corned beef sandwich is a reason to come here Freshly made in front of you Im pretty sure that the large has over a pound of meat The other sandwiches are just as good as are the burgers and wings They also have huge saladsThis is great for late night stop on your way through Wilkinsburg but beware the sandwich is pretty unmatched and will bring you back"

    "review":"More beers in one location than I have ever seen The Italian food particularly the thin crust gourmet pizza is quite good too  But its all about the beer here  Guess the mystery beer and win it for freeThis wasnt our first time at The Sharp Edge we had been here probably about 1 122 years ago and we remember liking it then This time Not so much in fact we probably wont be going back and definitely wont be recommending the place to our friends The food is overpriced the service borders on nonexistent and the food is barely mediocre My house salad was a small bowl of lettuce 3 marinated baby carrots 2 beet slices 3 grape tomatoes a peperoncini and onions and was priced at 550 Plus there was a hair in it YUM Ill never understand why they dont leave the plate in question somewhere in plain view until the new dish is brought in I cant help but think she just took it in the back and plucked the hair of the dish and brought it back to me Needless to say I barely ate the salad Hamburgers ran around 1100 Youre better off driving a few blocks further to BRGRIf you are in Pittsburgh and you like beer  This is the only place you need to go  Great location and very friendly staff  The food is spectacular  When I am back in the burgh I will be visiting againYes the beer selection is fabulous but the food is awesome I had the Mussels from Brussels Sauteed with bleu cheese mild sauce and a hint of cream steamed in a Belgian ale I also ate a burger called the Belgian which is Ground lamb and sirloin with shallot and bacon topped with whole grain mustard and smoked gouda If your in Pittsburgh you must try this place even if you dont drink beer And if you live in Pittsburgh well then Lucky YouWe had a very large party here not too long ago and I have to say how impressed I was with the service  You cant expect something sleek and modern and super trendy if you go to a place like this but my husband and I thought it was perfect  They were the only restaurantbar in Pittsburgh willing to give us a whole room with no minimum bar tab or extra cost  The service was wonderful  everyone had full glasses all night because the server was so attentive  She also knew a lot about the beer and was able to answer questions for us  When some people wanted to go home and we were having trouble getting a cab the manager called two for us and kept us updated on their progress  The best part was that we bought a couple of rounds for approx 30 people and the bar tab at the end was only around 300 which is a lot of money for beer but so so so much better than we thought it was going to be  I will definitely be going back :What an amazing selection of Belgian ales on tap at fair prices  I feel like Im in heaven every time I visit"

    "review":"Ya got your classic DJs  shipshaped into a delicious crafted sandwich  shared the steak  onion hoagie great portion size  Super high quality steak He pickles his own onions too get it so good  Watched someone walk out with the meatloaf which Im totally gonna try next  Would love to see em open for Sunday brunchFormer greasy spoon turned badass sammie shopThis place is really good The food is down to earth and delicious and you can tell they dont want you leaving here hungry DJ is a great guy to talk to while eating he has a lot of cool stories and he knows whats whatStopped in today for a bite with a friend he got the Rueben I got the Italian hoagie Both of these sandwiches came piled high with meat some zesty Zapps chips voodoo flavor to be exact tomato lettuce and pickle spear on the side The Italian hoagie came with pickled onions and sauted mushrooms We both ordered some fries  I dont know what they do with them but damn are they good I think they soak them or brine them and after cooking them throw a little seasoning on them perhaps Good stuff Although it was lunchtime it looks like they serve breakfast dishes all day long which is cool I am def going to try the frog legs at some point in the future I will be back I know thatYour friendly neighborhood sandwich shop Support local businessHonestly you could put some of these dishes up against ANY in Pittsburgh and you wouldnt be able to tell which one came from the Michelin striving one and which came from the small dineresque area with an appreciation for Davey Crockett decor  I honestly think this has potential to be the best place in Pittsburgh Ive been to Gaucho once but was more blown away hereFirst it probably helps that they have access to the freshest ingredients possible  Out of steak for salads Go to the butcher shop who owns both a few buildings down and get some which was just obtained from a local farm earlier that week  Out of tomatoes Go to the Linea Verde Green Market next door its a market of fresh vegetablesherbs etc  Onto what we ordered  Egg chorizo tacos steak avocado salad potato pancakes with smoked salmon and pear apple sauce and lastly the mako shark yes shark over fried vegetable rice  Each one of these dishes were immaculately prepared and cooked to perfection  My shark was perfectly textured somewhere between white fish and chicken breast  Delicious with the rice  Best steak salad Ive ever eaten it helps when the steak is super high quality  The smoked salmon had to have been from Wholeys but I cant prove that  They have a standard menu but they have specials regularly and their are very unique options on there they had blackened frog legs as a special along with the above listed sharkId say the only problem is that its not really open for dinner hours  But its a diner setup with limited seating and the hours coincide with the butcher shop probably necessary as its access to ingredients depends on the butcher shop being open  But screw dinner DJs Sandwich shop will have to settle for being the best lunch Ive had in Pittsburgh even up against heavyweights like Morcilla  GO TO DJS SANDWICH SHOP THEN GO TO THE BUTCHER AND PICK UP DINNERIF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIANBAND:  The Faces  The Rolling Stones The Who  and The Kinks to a lesser degree got all the hype and justifiably so  But The Faces were probably just as good despite the lack of advertisingAwesome Stopped here for late lunch on a Saturday I had the steak hoagie and BF had the buffalo frog legs at the recommendation of the cookwaiter who was super nice helpful and attentive The food was delicious and reasonably priced The meal was quick but not rushed I cant wait to come back and sit outside on a nice dayI had high expectations for this place but they were not met  We went for lunchThe menu was crowded and hard to read for me  I got the venison bacon burger with egg with lettuce tomato and onion cooked medium  My girlfriend got the chicken chorizo egg tacos without salsa  The wording was a little odd as it wasnt clear if it was a venison burger with bacon on top or a burger with venison bacon  Our server explained that it was a venison burger with bacon mixed in   We shared a single order fries and our server convinced us to get both the cheese and chili on top  We got just water to drinkThe waters were delivered first  in bottles  We were not asked if we wanted bottled water  My burger came out minus the LTO or any condiment other than a sunnysideup egg  The girlfriends tacos came out plus the salsa mixed in  Strike on both  Somehow my burger was rare on one side and welldone on the other I looked closely to see if there was evidence of bacon inside but I couldnt tell or taste  The burger with its crumbly roll drippy egg and thick slice of tomato was a beast to eat  Not quite good enough to finish thoughThe fries looked like theyd be pretty good naked  However they were buried under what looked to be cheese from a can and chili from a can  The grease pooled up in one corner and pretty quickly ended up overflowing onto the ground  We sat outside where the metal tables have holes by designThen came the check  30 for a twoperson lunch with a single split side with water to drink  Oh yeah those waters were 2 each  Upon attempting to pay I was told that it was cashonlyWith Mama Ros I would have paid half as much gotten a hug and been quite happy with my lunch  With this incarnation I feel swindled  I have no plans to return hereWell cant say much for the food because I didnt eat here Which is such a huge disappointment I was super looking forward to it after hearing so many good reviews as well as having really great expierience with the crew at Djs butcher block But thats the exact opposite for Djs Sandwich Shop The 2 person staff made me and my friend feel so uncomfortable and unwanted we just decided to leave When we walked in there were about 4 customers waiting for to go food We seated ourselves at the bar neither the guy or girl working greeted us in anyway other than slightly side eyeing us and looking annoyed we were there at 1:00 in the afternoon As soon as we say we realized there was a cell phone at my friends seat so I said to the guy is this someones cell phone Is someone sitting hereNow the tone of voice to which he replied thats the STORE phone and with and irritated gesture slid the phone across the counter away from us looked at the girl and said can you get them drinks To which she just sort of dumbly stared at us and turned back around and continued doing whatever she was doing and not acknowledging us It was so awkward and uncomfortable my friend turned to me and said this is weird I really dont want to eat here To which I completely agreed and we left No acknowledgement of us leaving either Seriously look into your staff because they suck at human interactions I wont be back"

    "review":"We had my friends 30th birthday party here This is actually the 3rd birthday party weve thrown here The VIP is the best We love having a place to call home baseAlso loved the hot waitress we had She was hustling all night for us We had about 15 people who are big drinkers so we kept her busy Drinks are fairly priced I dont feel like I spent more than an average night out in the city We didnt try the food except the pizza we ordered to take back to the hotel across the street And from what I remember it was good I have been in for lunch before and I love the cheese sticks Definitely will be back Thanks BuckheadI was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Buckheads Saloon I normally am not impressed with chain bars and restaurants and maybejust maybe I expect too much or Im very picky The service was very good this evening We had a private VIP Booth and I ordered the Sampler Appetizer actually 4 of them for the group For a bar of this type they were actually very fair The cheese sticks and pepperoni rolls had a won ton type wrap on them making them crunchy Drinks were a little pricy but this was a Station Square Bar All in all my picky butt would recommend this place for a get togetherWe reserved a table for New Years Eve last year Had a 3course meal with sparkling wine and miller high life Not a bad value but around 10  the crowd changed a lot A bunch of young kids  early 20s came in for the count down and the music was so loud you couldnt talk to the person next to you The server was really nice and kept us well stocked in the drink department Probably wont be back for another big event but a weekday when its less crowded should be fineMy 10 year class reunion was at Buckhead  Buckhead provided us with a private area for our party  We also received finger foods meatballs cheese sticks pepperoni rolls chicken fingers and cookies  It was 30 per person for the area and the food  The music selection was perfect for 90s babies  Lots of 90s songs  Their wine selection was very minimal and I thought their prices were kind of high  Parking can also be very expensive and limitedNice and clean but there wasnt but there wasnt more than two people there Had drinks only with great serviceyou people need to go to burger schoolour burgers looked whiteprobably frozen burgers boiledgrossthe pretzel rollsbeer and the steeler nation were the only good thing about this place"

    "review":"As with all of the fast food restaurants in this area of Ohio River Blvd this place is dumpy and dirty  The staff is also poorly supervised and Ive been privvy to more store gossip drama and horseplay than Ive ever experienced in any restaurant fast food or otherwise  They get so loud back in the kitchen that we will often stop our conversation in the dinning room to wait for them to quiet down a bit before we continue  The food itself is generally passableWorst fast food Ive ever been to A couple years ago this was a nice place It took a long time for someone to answer the drive thru and then the guy working the drive thru was very hard to understand like he had food in his mouth and basically clueless Once our order was finally understood it then took a very long time to get our food I thought we were overcharged but rather than deal with the clueless gentleman I decided to just move onWe stopped through the drive thru last night after helping my sister move It was midnight and thankfully something was open I ordered nuggets fries and a frosty My sister ordered the same and Bobby ordered two Jr Bacon cheeseburgers Well only one burger was in the bag we found out halfway Down the road Bobby said the other burger was dry and they forgot the mayo  my sisters fries had no salt on them lso she says Mine were fine but I kept that to myself to avoid her eating some of mine Typical older siblingAnyways I dont normally review fast food that Ive had bad experience at bc it happens often but totally forgetting a burger is not coolTERRIBLE No one expects fast food to be gourmet but this experience would make corporate cry Ordered food for 2 adults full meals and for one child and was charged for 2 more adult meals I asked why the amount was so high and the employee said nothing to me looked the other way and yelled for a manager Still feeling over charged but not wanting to agitate the situation any further we left with 1 less drink then we ordered cold food and a soda water instead of sprite because no one changed the syrup Never againWe keep expecting their food to be better than the last time Ive had enough Ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around 5 oclock Youd think the food would be fresh during the dinnertime rush Well youd be wrong The sandwiches and fries were all lukewarm and both chicken filets were so dry and tough that they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours We ordered an unsweetened iced tea and a Sprite with no ice Received an unsweetened tea with no ice and a cup of ice with some Sprite in itWeve previously been treated rudely for having the gall to use the drive thru 20 minutes before closing time Im trying to remember if we have ever been served a satisfactory meal there but Im having trouble coming up with a single example I can only assume that the manager is never there or is so incompetent as to defy belief This location coasts by solely on the reputation of other Wendys Do yourself a favor Go to Burger King or McDonalds down the road or hike up to the Wendys at West View Park"

    "review":"Smoky but surprisingly not divey  I like to think of it as the poor wellscrubbed stepsister of Silkys Just roll with meThe drinks are cheap and strong and the locals are friendly Its the kind of place where families go along with Bachelorette Party girls along with Greenfield brotypes along with retired millworkers Lots of Nice Drunks who give freely the handshakes and the EyyyyyyTheir karaoke night every other Saturday is a bunch of fun due to the meltingpot nature of the clientele where Right Said Fred rubs up against 50s boogiewoogie The only downside to karaoke night is that the kitchen closes early because of itWe were really blown away by the quality of the food here  The portions are big many items are made from scratch including about 5 different kinds of homemade pierogis and the prices are cheap  You can really tell the chefs take pride in what they serve  Ive never been to a dive bar with such awesome foodBased on the positive reviews others gave I thought this place would be great I have never been more led astray by YelpBackground: I am 22 but I was trying to find something fun to do with some friends who were 19 and 20 and both from Europe We had been turned away from other places for not all being 21 which was a huge annoyance to the Europeans who have been going to pubs and bars since they were 16 and saw that this place had karaoke and thought we should give it a try Outside the door was a sign that said Must be 18 to enter so we thought we should be fineAs we approached there was a dirty looking man pounding on a car He seemed to be beyond wasted but we figured he was probably just someone who had gotten out of hand and walked inside The interior was dirty looking and everyone at the bar seemed very drunk already it was only 10pm on a Saturday and no one was going near the karaoke machine We were deciding if we wanted to stay and sit when someone put his arm around me and one of my companions from behind us It turned out to be the guy who had been pounding on the car outside He asked us for our IDs and I asked if he worked there considering he was not wearing anything official looking and smelled like stale beer He informed us that he was the bouncer and then insulted my friend by commenting that she looked to be about 15 years old We all handed over our IDs and he left with them returning quickly to tell us we were fine and to have a seat We picked the nearest bar stools to us and the bartender was with us immediately We all ordered nonalcoholic beverages coke lemonade water and were about to start looking through the karaoke options when a man Im assuming the manager came over He asked how old we were and we told him our ages He said that since drinks were being served we could not stay even though we had ordered non alcoholic drinks and the sign outside said otherwise I pointed the sign  out to him and he seemed unaware of the markings on his own bar and asked us to leave We ended up leaving without any drinks feeling like our personal boundaries had been crossed and like we had been super insulted I like a good karaoke bar as much as the next person but this is NOT the place to go unless you like random men crossing your personal boundaries It did not seem to be a safe place for women at all Or for people who like to be clean Dont go here Its awfulA dive bar Perfect with an excellent bottled beer selection local talent gambling and engaging Seats about 25 comfortably small smoky place The owner Al is a gent hospitable and Joey behind the bar talks shit and pours a proper beverage A good unwind spotWell as of right now Yesterdays has gotten rid of its karaoke Im super sad to see it go Crossing my fingers that this will return in the near future  Ill be sure to update if it doesI just moved to Greenfield about 2 months ago and Im pretty glad to have a little cheap dive bar right across the corner  What all can you say about a dive This is exactly what I look for  dim lights cheap drinks and a friendly staff"

    "review":"If you love Pittsburgh sports  classic Pittsburgh food  beer you will love this place  First the atmosphere is great because youre surrounded by Pittsburgh sports memorabilia  The food is excellent Ive gone here for lunch many times  have always loved my meal  Today I had the special: clamchowder soup tuna fish sandwich  tatertots YumFriendly service  reasonable pricesIve had lunch at the Clark bar and Grill about 10 times Consistently good service and food  There are a few restaurants on the north shore to eat lunch this place gets you served in a reasonable time if you have less than an hourAmazing food  hands down my favorite place to eat in the city The manager Tom is wonderfully attentive and friendly The whole place is clean and holds a very proud pittsburgh feel to it just a lovely and affordable placeGot tickets to the ZoSo concert at Stage AE and decided to switch up my prelube location from something other than the Tilted Kilt River Towne or Bettis Grill I decided on the Clark Bar  Ive only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for lunch Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N Shore of pgh the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show Speaking of beers theres a limited selection of craft beers here  As of this writing on tap theyve got Penn Marzen Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap  In bottles theres Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but Im sorry I dont think soI walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasnt too crowded possibly due to the weather  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like Ive experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lotWhile waiting for my date to join me I started with a Sam Adams Cold Snap as a tribute to the days February single digit temps before moving on to the Marzen Both were decent beers very drinkable but nothing all that specialIt was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner By that time we were the only people left in the bar  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks Other than those times its before and after the ball games that draws the most business as you would expectThe menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers salads burgers sandwiches and the House Specialty Fish and Chips  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials wings and a Cajun burger  I decided I would go Cajun tonight My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger My Cajun burger was spicy good delicious perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce I also got a sample slice of my ladys turkey burger yeah we do that and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese onion lettuce and tomato Her burger came with slaw and mine with friesOverall this is a casual easy bar  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner But whats really cool is all of the autographed baseballs bats and footballs in the hallway behind the barId recommend this place to any outoftowner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance service and delicious burgers If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five starsI went here for lunch and got the grilled cajun chicken sandwich and salad both of which were fine  The service was really good  Overall not a bad place but nothing spectacularHorrible food horrible service Im really not sure how this place manages to stay in business"

    "review":"One of the worst Wendys Ive ever experienced  Every morning there was a 30minute wait  after ordering  for foodBest Wendys experience Ive ever had And I wouldnt normally take the time to review fast food We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving The idea was to hit up the EatNPark over by Giant Eagle but alas they were closedWe pulled into the drive thru and were immediately greeted Needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered which we were We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window They were moving quickly smiling and paying attention to what they were doing We got our drinks and paid and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind usWe waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us I mean presentation AND style At a fast food drivethru at midnight So cool He was funny attentive and totally made our night I dont even LIKE Wendys that much but I will definitely be back and soonI dont remember the last time I stepped into a fast food burger joint  Every time I come here whether it be midday evening or late night there is ALWAYS a wait in the drive thru  Go at the right time and the person doing the drive thru intercom could be the best entertainment you get in a while  Oh yeah the food isnt all that bad either props for the fresh cut friesPlease clean your floor properly  It feels like Crisco under your feet  Very dangerousDidnt get all of the items I ordered AND PAID FOR Whats worse is I wasnt given a receipt so I cant even prove they forgot to give me something When I called corporate to tell them of this they said I could just go back and since I had some food in hand that I should get what was missing with no receipt I dont think so she decided to give me the store number instead so I can inform the manager before driving there So they gave me the number and all it is is BUSY the few times you can get through its a dialup set of tones that are ear piercing We also didnt get straws or utensils for our food Though there wasnt hardly any wait at all so I must have been lucky there but not lucky enough for good service"

    "review":"Great selection of Belgium beers a little priceyWorst staff of people They dont care to correct their mistakes and will insult you if you try to order off the menu Tried to order a Bloody Mary and brought me a V8 with no celery No restaurant manners and wouldnt bring any plates and utensils Its sad Im born in Pittsburgh and in town visiting and the sharp edge was my favorite go to spot Im excited to see the new restaurants in the area because I need a new go tonowGreat beer selection mediocre at best food  Always come for the beer which is a 4 selection but the waitstaff has always left much to be desired  Tonight was sitting outside for 20 minutes because I biked over with no lock I know dumb and when I finally caught the waitresses attention she said go see the hostess  There was half tables full  Go for the beer and sit at the bar  Whatever you do avoid the waitress who looks like shes trying to be rockabilly but has never actually seen anyone doing itService was mediocre at best Food was incredibly poor quality: literally had a freezing cold French fry served to me The only thing they have going for them is good beer selection Thus one star for the beerThe service here was efficient enough but not personal or all that friendly The selection of beers is nice but no real recommendations from the waiter Or explanation of what mystery beer he served even was The food was above average bar food but nothing stood out Overall value was strong during a midweek happy hour  Buffalo bites French fries jerk chicken pizza 9 plus 89 beers for under 60 Feels like it would have been more other placesNot a bad place to catch a few after workGreat selection of Beer and good food if you pay attention  Dont order a burger concentrate on the mussels or entrees"

    "review":"This sushi is great for the Pittsburgh area Awesome rolls fish is fresh and Ive only ever had a pleasant experience Its not superior quality but definitely one of the best options of the south side shady side Oakland area The lunch combo options also come with large portionsThis is the place to go if you like rollsall types  I got a veggie roll plate But the rolls I got in the side were absolutely delicious  They were the avocado peanut rolls     There is not a lot of variety if you are vegetarian or vegan other than the two selections I mentioned above They also have a plain avocado roll and maybe about 5 veggie rolls        This seems to be a mostly Japanese style Asian restaurant  They had soba noodles and teriyaki This is what my husband ordered  They also serve authentic green tea  The service is excellent The ambience is beautiful       Loved itWe checked Sake out on a cold Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised The service was pleasant and the food quite good Best of all it wasnt a zoo and we didnt have to wait an hour for a tableContrary to popular belief Nakama is not the only good place to get sushi in southside Plus who can beat 50 on Sundays and Mondays My favorite are the Miami Heat roll avoid if you hate super fishy sushi and the sweetheart rollWe stopped by before the dinner crowd came in We had been at a funeral and I was walking my dog hungry having missed lunch I knocked on the door just to ask for a menu The manager Tom allowing me to bring my dog into the waiting area so i could sit down and give him my order He even went back to the kitchen and came back to give my dog a treat He told me i could expect the food in 20 minutes allowing me time to walk the dog When i returned there was a package waiting When I  took it back to our hotel  my wife and I were delighted with our dinner Delicious miso soup perfectly crisp lettuce salad spicy tuna and sweet potato rolls my wife had salmon exactly as I ordered grilled with no sauces I had the Thai mango chicken All deliciousPrice was reasonablesushi was AMAZING best sushi Ive ever head service as on point they were there when we needed stuff and went out of their way to find us a bottle that they thought they were out of I highly recommend this place to everyone"

    "review":"Ive been craving Chinese for a few weeks now I havent found my go to spot in the area yet but Id been by this place a time or two and had not been turned off by anything I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan and some fried rice Everything was ready in maybe 5 min The dining area was small but tidy I chose to eat at home though The fried rice satisfied my craving nothing special but just what I needed to hit the spot The MGGP even had fresh zucchini a nice surprise All was reasonably priced No where near gourmet but if youre looking for typical Chinese takeout itll do5 star Chinese takeout Simple fresh flavorful fast Chinese takeout thats fairly close to my house and isnt expensive Been looking for a good Chinese takeout place since we moved here last year This is itWell This week is my birthday and after a friend pushed me to let her take me to lunch at her fav Chinese food hereI never ate here before and gave it the EggRoll test What the H dont people know how to make an Egg rolls anymorecause This place it wasnt hand made it was a frozen one you get at a supermarket horrible Only a yellow shredded cabbage nothing else but it was Soggy in center raw And I asked Waitress for hot Tea Was told we dont have that I live in San Diego and they brought a pot of hot tea before you ordered I long for those places here Well my friend ordered I forgod it  checkout said to cashier That was the worst EggRoll  She said sometimes you have good days  bad days Never againMy husband and I tried this place for the first time two nights ago He had the bourbon chicken and I had the curry with chicken both definitely couldve used more sauce It was surprisingly tasty the place was very clean and we didnt have to wait long Will visit again soonThis restaurant puts no effort at all into soups or egg rolls  They just buy the same Wontons and egg rolls that you would buy in the frozen food department  The Shrimp and Chicken dishes arent bad but unless you order extra sauceyou get almost no sauce at all  I judge all Chinese places by their Crab Rangoons  They have decent Crab Rangoons but they are way over priced for what they give you  The entire menu is over priced to be truthful I tried to order 1 and a half orders of Crab Rangoons and you would think I asked them to cure cancer  They out right refused to sell me 1 whole order plus a half order  I told them they lost a customer because they refused to sell me a 15 order and they couldnt have cared less  I will not go back to this placeCome to pittsburgh for a two night stay for shopping and my parents refused to eat fast food for dinner and wanted Chinese food instead So I choose this restaurant as it was the closest to the hotel with a good review When I first walked in I was surprised it wasnt like a restaurant but a food courts style where you order and take the food home I order 3 pint of shrimp fired rice in Chinese and it cost around 20 The owner absolutely refused to take the order to us in Chinese and force us to order in English I wasnt angry but the order is still written in Chinese and the owner still yelled out the order in Chinese to the kitchen anyways so what was the problem for me ordering in Chinese The food came quickly in less then 5 minutes and we took it back to our hotel It was hard to eat it out of the oyster pail but the food tasted OK but they really over done it with the oil and salt We tasted that they put a LOT of MSG We were so thirsty afterwards we had to chugged down almost a gallon of water The next day we went back and order the same thing but this time asking for less oil and salt This time it actually tasted way better then the first and we were not all thirsty afterwards Mine recommendation order it with less salt and oilMinus 1 star for foodMinus 5 star for value Minus 5 star for service"

    "review":"Im writing this review as I sat in the drive through for 25 minutes for 2 hard tacos I would give a zero but I cant Rudest workers and all around ghetto Talking about having sex heard over the order speaker Get to the window she is rude and talking to a coworker how she whooped this bitchs ass  Her words No just dont come hereThe Sunday shift wasnt calling out orders and when food was sent to the wrong table they didnt remake the order I had to go back to the register 3 times because they kept messing up my order They just dont listen to their customers or careAfter a year without Taco Bell in my life I was sad when I realized they removed the enchirito from the menu The awesome staff and manager took the time to make it for me anyways : very satisfied customerService is very slow Every time I go there they are out of 4 out of the 5 things I came there to order Points for my order actually being correct most other taco bell locations cannot manage even thatI visit this Taco Bell a little more often than I should because some days I just need a quick bite to get me through an evening of errands or to pick me up after a very long shift at work The food they serve is fine enough  by Taco Bell standards of course Theres certainly better places for tacos and whatnot in the area but this Taco Bell makes pretty tasty fast food that hits the spot on a bad dayBut man the service Every time I come here the drivethru is horridly backed up for one reason or another Not only are the workers not prompt in taking orders not once have I been able to place an order right away after pulling up to the station to do so said orders are never ready when people make it to the window I honestly dont think theyve ever had enough people on staff during my visits to handle orders from the drivethru AND indoors The result is delay after delay and my fast food order here has never gotten to me under 15 minutes And because of the design of the drivethru you cant even leave to go to Wendys when youre ready to give up Youre trapped and forced to sit And wait And waitI think whoever is managing the place really needs to reevaluate the busy hours here and adjust staffing accordingly It shouldnt take 15  20 minutes to get a cheap taco from a Taco Bell Definitely skip this place if youre in a rush"

    "review":"Last Friday I stopped into Gus Cafe for a quick last minute drink  Fell in love with their back patio and stopped back Tuesday 93014  Turns out it was half off burger night If you know me you know that I typically have one burger per year and Im glad I chose that designation for this one  While the Heisenburger wasnt up to the level of Walter Whites namesake it still was pretty good the onions were caramelized perfectly and the bun tasted like it was just bakedAdded a side of belgian fries though I wouldnt call it a side by any means  the tray could feed a small army  The fries were amazing and not like anything I have ever had though the aioli on the side lacked anything resembling flavorMy friend I was with opted for the hummus and enjoyed that as wellBeing that it is in Lawrenceville where you better be on point with your beer selection Gus Cafe didnt disappoint on that end eitherWhile it seems like Gus Cafe could add a few servers to the roster I must say the server we had went above and beyond  As I mentioned I wanted to sit on the patio  Now the twinkling lights must have clouded my judgement because we knew it was most likely going to rain  Well the umbrella didnt suffice once the downpour came  After making a break for indoors I must say it was beyond kind that the server offered to go outside to attempt to bring in our remaining food  We of course declined but the offer was appreciatedEvery hood needs the neighborhood place that is a step above the typical neighborhood hangout and Gus Cafe provides thatCame here tonight for the first time I probably wont be coming back Service was slowa total of an hour for food to come out It was understaffed Dont waste your timeReally nice place Great easy parking great walking in area Right across street from the cemetery on butler street I wish I had come here earlierNow that this is a burger place I have to change my review This place still seems pretty safe for celiac people but its a bummer that they changed itThe toppings on the burgers all seem pretty good but Ive ordered a burger from here four times now Medium or medium rare and its been well done every timeThe staff here is friendly and helpful but I really wish they would comp me more since my food is never right Despite its faults I still like this place and want it to succeed so Ill continue to support themI really liked the vibe at Guss Its a good location and has a good tap list and bottle selectionI had the daily vegan special which was a spicy burrito and delicious  Our table opted to split an order of the fries and it took 5 of us to finish it I wish there were more veganvegetarian items Overall great food and atmosphereLast night we went to Guss for dinner  My boyfriend was given a Groupon from his employer for 2 hamburgers and 2 french fries  My girlfriend also went with us  So here is our orderfried pickles whole wings and the 3 burgers and friesFirst of all we had the BEST waitress LIZ who was wonderful  She told us all about the menu and was very personable  The pickles were fantastic  The batter was sooo good just as previous posts have said  The wings were big and delicious  By this time we were so filled from the appetizers we had little room for the burgers  My boyfriend ate half of his and he said it was delicious too  Me and my girlfriend ordered a make your own burger which was so big  We only had a little taste and then took the rest home for lunch today  As I am eating it now you can tell the ground meat is fresh and tasty  The bacon on it is not your ordinary bacon in the package from the store  It is thick and plentiful  The carmalized onions really make the burger  If you would love a great burger great service just go to Guss and ask for Liz  She is the best and the food was top notch  We will be back"

    "review":"Amazing food and a great atmosphere It tasted like real Italian food The grilled calamari was perfectly cooked and the appetizers were all very well doneOh and their dipping sauce for the bread is amazing Definitely recommendedA good friend suggested Matteos so we headed there on a recent weekend As usual hubs and I were a few minutes behind so our dinning companions went ahead and ordered an appetizer while they waited When I arrived I was very surprised by the decor trendy yet classy Modern and open I loved it There were very few tables and a decent sized bar in the very back Seemed a bit odd to have to walk past all of the diners to get a drink at the bar This typesize of restaurant seems more suited for BYOB in my opinion Now onto the foodThe greens and beans app arrived just as we joined the table We gave it a try and were immediately impressed As I enjoyed the complimentary flavors of the sausage beans and spinach I looked over the menu as well as the specials written on the chalk board at the back of the room They had me at vodka sauce Penne vodka and prosciutto I sipped on a glass of wine while anxiously waiting If vodka sauce is on the menu theres about 100 chance I will be trying it That said Ive tried a number of vodka sauces all over the city In all of my vodka experiences I can confidently say this was one of my favorites In addition to a bright tangy and well balanced sauce there were large chunks of prosciutto It wasnt topped with small slices or as I say flakes of prosciutto No no There were thick chunks mixed throughout However I still craved more meaty goodness so I asked for a side of sausage A few minutes later I was presented with sliced sausage on a bed of greens The sausage seemed a bit spicier than what was in the greens and beans app but ultimately very deliciousOverall my experience at Matteos was phenomenal    so far Then it came time for the check We asked for separate checks by couple 2 couples There were a couple issues with the checks and it ended up taking us over half an hour to pay Services had been a little slow all night but this was ridiculous However the food will definitely bring me back for round two Hopefully the service improves before thenAwesome Italian food  The chef was previously at Serafinas in Crafton  so if you liked that food  you will LOVE this place  I try something different every time I go and have enjoyed all of it  The grilled chicken salad crabcake sandwich pizza and sausage lasagna it was a special are some of my many favoritesVery mellow and relaxed vibe If you want to smash some pasta this is the place My favorite is the mushroom ravioli My friend got the chicken parm and it was absolutely enormous 3 meals at least The greens and beans are a must have appetizer and can DEFINITELY be ordered as a main dish The servers were very attentive and consistent but not annoying If youre looking for a more relaxed atmosphere go to Matteos Also the desserts are amazing Any of themMy husband and I stopped for lunch last Saturday we were the only people in the whole place  The waiter was so friendly The bread and dip was amazing We both ordered the chicken bacon sandwich with tortellini salad they was fantastic The tortellini salad is such a nice change for a side option  The lunch prices and sizes were perfect  We felt perfectly full but not weighed down  It would have been 5 stars if only they had a better outside areaI went here with a large group of friends and I have to say that the service was the worst experience Ive had The server was extremely rude to our party impatient and unprofessional We laughed about it of course but shared it with the manager because otherwise we enjoyed the food Because of this its unlikely that Ill visit the restaurant again Hopefully their service has improved so they do well"

    "review":"Let me first say that the service is great  So cudos to the waitress however the waitress only takes the order and brings the foodThe bread served was stale and tasteless the oil dipping sauce matchedWe started with fresh deep fried mozzarella despite being cooked the cheese was cold and soggy  I have had this dish elsewhere and it has been prepared properly  Here I would not recommend at allWe have been here a couple of times and the food is very inconsistent perhaps average at best depending on the dish you order  The Veal Marsala was one of the worst I have ever ordered anywhere  The veal was clearly a lesser cut basically a roll roast cut into thick slices NOT pounded flat at all  So it was just several pieces of 38 hockey puck size of veal which was not tender  The Marsala sauce was missing something tasted bitter or sour I think it was missing the marsala  The dish was overpowered by an excessive quantity of jumbo shitake mushrooms I mean overpowered  Not an enjoyable meal at allMy wife ordered the Bucatini with marinara now that was not bad the bucatini is a relatively large round noodle which is like spaghetti on steriodsOverall the restaurant is very small and very noisy but that is acceptable  But the food is just a complete hit or miss for the price  Too pricey for hit or missHard to find it was in a shopping plaza but delicious Get a reservation and bring some vino House salad dressing was so good I wish they sold itWe have been to Burloni many times over the past few years Every time we left full happy and content Yes this place is very small They do have a few tables outside when it is warm Our latest adventure to IB brought a table of 8 Im sure they were annoyed with us seeing I called the day of to make reservations and called back 2 more times that day to change the number of people Regardless our table was ready when we arrived We started our meal with the calamari fried zucchini and sausage with peppers and onions The sausage is my favorite app Not too sweet not too spicy Perfectly complimented with freshly sauteed onions and peppers Although I have tried many dishes at IB my go to is the grilled chicken pollo griglia with vegetables Two marinated chicken breasts grilled and served with a huge plateful of various veggiescarrots broccoli potatoes onions peppers cauliflower brussel sprouts If its in season youre getting it I always add a large helping of the shredded cheese they leave for you on the table Another favorite is the pasta bolognaise which hubs ordered and I stole a few bites of They also offer a few desserts that change with the season Unfortunately Im usually too full to try them Overall small restaurant not much in the way of decorambience but great foodGUYS I thought this place was really good before but I just went back and they totally knocked it out of the park As always the service was great I can never remember our servers name  eek  but she was wonderful but OMG THE FOOD I had one of the specials linguine allo scoglio this time around Its a linguine dish that comes with mussels scallops crab calamari and shrimp You had your choice of red or white sauce and I got the white which was an olive oilgarlic situation It was AMAZING If you are ever in the area check this place outFirst off our waitress was the nicest person to walk the earth She kept giving us free bread and when we wanted to share the caprese app she put it on three separate plates for us to make it easier I had the paparadelle with sausage onion goat cheese and a lite tomato sauce She let me sub out sausage for eggplant The portion was enormous and extremely flavorful It was a hidden gem for surePappardelle with sausage and goat cheese was very good Started with grilled calamari and this was just delicious with the sundried tomato sauce and olives Dessert was excellent  Key lime pie and wild blueberry pie Yes there is a huge difference in blueberries and if you havent tried wild what  are you waiting forThe music was a tad loud but that keeps the conversation confidential Take a nice red and enjoy the Italian cuisine"

    "review":"Standard chain in market square Packed during lunch For me the menu is weak But they have been running short promos of new temporary items and they have been okGood for what its good for A quick bite to eat with lots of options for vegetarians My daughter was a big fan of the mac  cheese I was more soso on the IndonesianPeanut Saut When I mentioned that the edamame was way over cooked inedible the response was Thats too bad  I do expect more action then sympathy at a restaurant when I indicate a problem SighNoodles are good but the soda machine is my favorite part For my first time here I decided to try a bunch of things I specifically went with a bunch of people so we could share I ended up sampling the mac and cheese penne rosa tomato basil bisque steak stroganoff and the Japanese pan noodles Everything was good maybe a slight cut above the average noodle joint though macaroni and cheese was easily my favorite Sadly the pan noodles were a bit too charred though they substituted them for another dish without any hassle The soup was pretty good and it costing only a buck extra with a meal was pretty nice Its a busy place and the interior is a bit too cafeterialike for me though the tables themselves are nice The real highlight for me was the soda machine almost worth the trip in itself Its a new touch screen set up which has all manner of coke products and allows each one to be customized with different flavors strawberry sprite orange coke etc The only downside is only one person can use it at a time It certainly brought out the kid in meI had high hopes from what people had said about this place but while good the food just wasnt anything exceptionalPositives things about this restaurant:  When you walk in the menu with pictures is posted on the wall It is was easy to read with clear pricing and very descriptive After we looked at the menu for about 5 minutes one of the employees came over and asked if she could answer any questions for us She was very patient knowledgeable and helpful We soon decided and approached the counter where you order The cashier was personable and very nice They had waitressesbusers that brought our food and helped with anything they could They were very attentive and willing to help They fixed my meal in a timely manner and were very polite Very nice drink machine with immense amount of choices They had a drink for everyone The areas that I felt were negative was the cashier was new and did not know the menu very well and rang up our drinks incorrectly When my food came outJapanese Pan Fried Noodles the noodles and steak was burnt very badly The food was not amazing It was not awful but it was just below average I feel like the menu was limited for a specialty restaurant Although drinks were a positive there were drinks you could not get because they were out I do not know if this was due to Light Up night and they were unable to refill them or if they just had not done it Pricing was not very good Cafeteria style and uncomfortable chairs and tablesi prefer boothsSome improvement would be a change in the atmosphere seating upgrades better food quality and selection and have drinks on stock when neededI would not come here again because it does not really stand out among the other establishments in the same area This restaurant is located in Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh so there are multiple restaurants in the square and the only reason we chose this restaurant because we decided it was the most kidfriendly restaurant at which we had not already eaten The most important improvement would be food quality because if the menu stayed the same and the food they had improved I would be willing to give it a second chanceAverage taste Over price You have to pay around 250 extra for adding any meatWent here for lunch with some people I work with  They do a really good job with putting the menu not just behind the registers but also right after you walk in o you can decide what you want while you are in lineThey have one of those Coke machines that let you customize your drink but a lot of the flavors were not working when I was thereThere is a lot of seating which is nice since this location is in an area that gets really crowded at lunch timeThe food itself was not bad  I had Indonesian Peanut Saut with chicken  It came with a fresh lime I thought that was a nice touch"

    "review":"I found this place by accident half a year ago and have been going regularly ever since The food is extremely authentic and has large portions for its reasonable prices Service is fast and the restaurant is overall very clean Would highly recommendWanted to grab Indian food takeout and found this place AMAZING AMAZING FOOD Had the chicken korma and chicken curry along with naan and chicken samosas All were greatA really decent lunch buffet I remember liking their salad and different dressings a lot It has a great location that is close to school but when compared with other Indian buffets in Oakland I dont think it is the most competitive one Bottom line recommend for people like Indian food and also being around the neighborhoodWHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE  The restaurant must have changed owners  I began eating at Bangal Kabab House when it opened up  I would have rated it 5 stars then all the way up until this summer which was the last time I went before today  Today was a completely different experience  The new staff was not friendly but worst of all they are serving VERY SMALL PORTIONS NOW  The fish pakora portion was tiny  Channa Chat in 2 togo containers  smaller containers and they were only half filled  i told my friend about it and she said the Mali kofta she got this weekend was worse 3 tiny bite sized pieces floating in 12 oz of saucegravy  Everything still tastes authentic just like Bangla cuisine Slightly different recipes than before But unless they start giving people the portions they are paying for they will not last long as a businessI had a fish curry that made me want to stand up and applause Terrific and so incredibly cheap I spent thirteen dollars for a gutbuster of a meal Also their chutneys are totally on point you can tell when a restaurant is being lazy with the chutneysServes great biryani and buffet You could go for great tandoori n biryanisvery welcoming Staff did change which could be a little concern However on the whole decent food"

    "review":"Sat outside and had a great dinner  The food was delicious and the service was very good  Its very close to hotels so a really nice change from hotel food when youre on business travelPizza was good but really expensive I also got a 6 pack that cost 14 dollars The same 6 pack cost 750 back in my hometown  When it was all said and done our pizza wings soup and 6 pack cost 50We love their pasta fagoli on Fridays  There were 6 of us and the staff was very attentive  All of the food was great and we liked sitting upstairsOne of my standby restaurants when Im in the Green Tree area of Pittsburgh Small Italian calzone would be plenty to share between two people Their wedding soup is very good and I recommend it Good Italian food for those that tire of Olive Garden or Fazolis  In nice weather you can dine al fresco on their deck Casual atmosphere no dress code Never had a bad meal hereBest pizza in the area Italian subs are good quality Service was A1 but ya gotta watch out for the Psycho dishwasher or busboy every 2 minutes this guy comes strolling past our table cracking his knuckles giving us the Evil Eye really weirdWe stumbled on this place on a Friday night The place was moderately busy but we were seated right away The server was friendly but service was pretty slow considering how many servers were working We ordered the artichoke hearts to start  I recommend staying away from those They were around 9 and had obviously just come from a can and had some Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top The rest of the food however was delicious We ordered the spinach pizza with white sauce and an Italian calzone They were both HUGE and the pizza was one of the best Ive had"

    "review":"This is a decent Panera but not one of my favorites in Pittsburgh Try the one at the waterfront instead Nothing really wrong with this one except the location borders on sketchyEverything was exactly as expected when I arrived  The place was pretty dead when I visited however I assume because of the incoming blizzard  I did not experience any of the issues the previous yelpers experienced  The music was at a perfect volume the cashier was extremely polite and my food came out perfect  I would not hesitate to stop here if Im ever in Pittsburgh again and I wouldnt be afraid to recommend it to someone else  Keep at it PaneraMy only problem is the services here Just bloody rude for no reason Other than that the food was absolutely deliciousIts Panera so expect to experience the corporate Panera vibe The store was tidy and clean and the staff friendly I was needing some food and coffee after a long night and they were close After my disaster with Ritters Diner filthy place and growing weary of the Starbucks I headed down The breakfast sandwich was ok and although asking for one pump of mocha I watched as they disregarded my request and put several pumps of syrup into my drink Other than that no surprises hereMe and my friend were here yesterday AUG 10th around 11am and we think its the Cleanest panera we have ever been to just about spotless and the food was pretty good also just the cashier was rudeI work nearby so I go to this Panera for lunch as a last resort I only get soup and bakery items I refuse to pay 11 for wilted lettuce or one slice of turkey on a tiny sandwich The quality is terrible The service is usually ok But I was once waited on by a manager who didnt speak to me Not even to tell me my total But he was very nice to the girl behind me I havent seen him lately hopefully he got firedThree stars for the soup and bakery"

    "review":"Ehhhh I cant put my finger on why Im not feeling this place I just wasnt into the whole vibe The appetizer tomato mozzarella white anchovies was super cold like they had made a bunch and stuck them in the fridge My fish was done well but I didnt love the sauce or the presentation My husbands burger was done well too but also just a little flat These dishes just didnt excite me when they came to the table Couple this with the Coca Cola glasses and the rickety chair we left feeling just kind of blah about the whole experienceWhat a gem of a place in Shadyside  It s places like this that makes me miss living there  Food was outstanding  Because it was our first time we wanted to do a little bit of this and that  2 appetizers Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh a clam dish forgot name with the best tomatoewhite wine I could have drunk from the bowl broth Becky s salad the lemon dressing was out of this world deliciousagain could have drunk it good  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it that I ate it happily  Good pairing  The special of the night we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies  Small veggie selection by american standardshalf russet potato slither of zucchini and a stem of green onion but the star afterall was the lamb and it was meduim perfect just as I ordered  Would you care for some dessert Ramon our waiter he was fabulous asked  And so round 3 begins  Coffee a chocolate mousse with whip cream beauty and  their version of creme brulee  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter but not sure  Regardless it was  so so divineThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed unlike most places  The service was great the atmoshphere quaint it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe alot of repeat clientele from what I gathered  We shall returnFinally on an end note Cafe Zinho is BYOB so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino  And they only take cash or personal check but they do have an ATMCafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food Everything looked great on the menu but execution was flawed through out our meal Also their dishes are not really PortugueseFor appetizers we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce The chicken livers lacked flavor which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty The bread pudding was pretty good thoughEntrees were on the whole not impressive The lamb chops were obviously over cooked we ordered medium rare and the insides were almost fully cooked The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet The seafood stew lacked flavor The lamb burger was also overcookedShopping at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner my wife thought of Cafe Zinho which is nearby  I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly they had an open table for us  Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one  We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe bought a Spanish red and showed up at Cafe Zinho  They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine and brought over two nice stems  The waiter gave us menus described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over  We both ordered the soup of the day a pumpkin bisque my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree and I chose a lamb burger not Elysian Fields lamb I asked  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread  It had a delicious sweetness Our soups came out fairly quickly  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious and filling cream soup  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees  My wifes side salad was large as side salads go  She was quite pleased with it  It had baby greens tomato olives hearts  reduced red wine vinaigrette  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment  My lamb burger was huge  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger  Note to self do not order a salad if youre going to order the lamb burger  I ordered the burger cooked mediumwell even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium  It came out just the way I wanted it with just a hint of pink in the middle and full of delicious juices  My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy  I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room  My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then and she too gave up  We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us  It was a very nice meal and dining experience  We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name  Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here oftenPros: BYOB tasty food reasonable noise level outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally friendly and attentive service if a bit unpolishedCons:  Ambience it originally was a gas station and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor tables are packed every which way into the available interior spaceMoved to Pittsburgh from Philly a year ago Our standard for restaurants is if it were in Philly would be go back The answer for Cafe Zinho is YES  One of the only excellent restaurants in the City along with Salt and Dish If you find the Big Burrito empire restaurants and their coy cats lackluster and are looking for something outstanding go here Cozy BYO and excellent food particularly if you go with the Portuguese items on the menu  Our faves were the sardines to start and the fish stew for a main OMG good  Okay in Philly I would give this four starts but for Pittsburgh 5The food here is really amazing We ordered stuffed cornbread and vegetable soup as appetizers For entree we had roasted duck and pork loin They both taste really Portugal with a hint of sweetness The downside of this restaurant is that they ONLY accept cash"

    "review":"Ehh chicken was ok nothing special Just another chicken and sub spot located in the shopping plaza of east hills across from Giant Eagle They have the menu posted on the wall large enough for anyone to see but the inside looks horrible The floor is tore up showing the very guck left behind from when you tear up vinyl or tile and the trowel marks are left there They have a sign saying excuse our mess we are in the middle of remodeling but ECK Most of their informatory signs are written on Neon poster board in Permanent marker Not quite a professional place a business The cashier behind the counter was wearing a hair cap thats only suppose to be used before bed and not as an appropriate fashion symbol If people cant dress appropriately at their job then im not interested in a nothing they have to sell There was no seating either standing room only I only went here to buy some food for a relative but I wont be coming back on my own i have no reason to and honestly would not want toYes this place is a dive so be forewarnedHoney Bees has moved a few times over the years and is now located in a little shopping center on the borderline of Penn Hills and Wilkinsburg The location can be a little sketchy at night It is a pretty ghetto take out only spot so you will be getting your food to go when you visit One time I ask for a takeout menu and the women behind the counter told me to take a picture of the menu on the wall Really The main attraction here is the fried chicken wings which most of the time are hit or miss The last few times I had them they just werent any good They were lacking flavor and were just too small and made me will like I was eating a baby pigeon They do offer burgers salads sandwiches and hoagies as well but I have never tried themThe sides are the only saving grace for this place They offer the usual suspects mac n cheese greens green beans potato salad and more The last few times Ive gotten my chicken elsewhere and just came here for the sidesAs others have said the place is in desperate need of the Restaurant Makeover treatmentIt just breaks my heart that Pittsburgh doesnt have one really nice sit down Soul Food restaurant where you can get a wide variety of things You have to go one place for ribs and another of fried chicken and yet another for sides Yes theres Carmi which is very good but their menu is lacking And theres Savoy but at those high prices I dont consider that to be soul food When I have a taste for wings Ill just go to the nearby Genuine Pub or to Mohans as they are both superior in every way and just get my sides for either Showcase BBQ or Honey Bees"

    "review":"This space was recently remodeled in effort to change from shady sixpack store to a neighborhood pub The space looks GREAT all but for the waytoobright lighting which completely kills the charm of the space Also killing the mood was the rerun of a baseball game on the TVs and complete lack of music and energy It was midnight on a Saturday night and we WERE looking for something chill but this was a little too chilly I wouldnt want blasting music but some pleasant background sounds might have earned a third star My weak drink left much to be desired though We did not try the food but will try to return to do so and report back  obviously theyre just getting started with this venture Menu may be viewed on their facebook page: https:wwwfacebookcompagesParkPlacePub120093864751077skinfo Theres also talk of a patio to be opened soon on which I suggest low lighting so that one may escape the overbearing flood lights of the bar The bar is nonsmoking which I commend As a resident of this neighborhood I want this place to do well It just needs to have softer lighting some decent vegan food items and well balanced drinks to gain my personal approvalTypical neighborhood bar A couple TVs that have the local sports on There is a new outdoor patio which isnt fancy but it is a nice place to hang out Has some of the best burgers in PittsburghThis is a neighborhood bar with a paywhenorder gourmet burger kitchen attached  Good service  Locally sourced everything  The blue burger was perfect  The fries were great  The separate food and alcohol services is not inconvenient at allI live a couple blocks from here and never went in because it was always empty  but times have changed  This place is becoming a totally cool neighborhood hangout with some fine bartenders namely Caleb and a kick ass burger joint that leases  in the back Chef James rocks it  Great juke box lots of laughs you will feel right at home  Alone or with friends this is a highland park cheers  Also open on holidays if you need a place to get away from family Been there xmas eve and it was much neededThe new proprietors of the kitchen have successfully created the most delicious burger Ive ever tasted  The burgers consist of different hand ground cuts of free range hormone free beef  The French fries are double blanched and double fried that guarantees a crisp yummy fry  The onion rings are cut to order the tempura batter light and the homemade dipping sauce is perfect  Stop in ask for James hes one of the new owners of kitchen and the head chefBest wings in pittsburgh I love this place"

    "review":"Traveled from Washington finding a local couple recommending Carmellas Great atmosphere and better company Paige absolute best service in PittsburghI was riding my bike around south side and decided to stop into Carmellas The first thing you notice when walking in is the attention that was paid to the interior Wood is everywhere and you kind of feel like youre in a camping lodge Its really quite cozy The place was empty and I was alone and in a hurry so I sat at the bar hoping to get the steak tartare I saw on their menu It turned out to be brunch so I was a little bummed that I wasnt going to get the tartare but brunch on a Saturday is hard to come by so I was also excited I ordered the baked eggs It took some time for my order to come and I feared that the eggs were sitting I was right They were rock hard and the tomato sauce was pretty pretty generic There was a little spinach and beet salad on the side that was a little bit on a saving grace but not enough I usually dont sent things back and was pretty tight on time However I should have said something in this case I ascribe my disappointing meal to a slow shift and a lazy waitress Thats not to say she was a bad waitress I was once there and the slowest shifts are the hardest to care about good service sometimes I didnt like the eggs but the salad gave me the confidence to say that I would give Carmellas another shot Side note the music sucked It didnt go with the ambiance of the restaurant at all and should definitely be changed in my opinionFood was excellent atmosphere was very pretty We will definitely be returning  The mojito was perfect and my family had the French press We went for Fathers Day brunch and it was a perfect lunch Nice waitstaff Deserts were excellent as wellAwesome food amazing drinks and attentive staff  We came here for my friends birthday and we could not have picked a better placeI was in Pittsburgh for a conference and a group of us were directed thereby a friendly local couple we found  We enjoyed the friendly fun atmosphere so much we made a point of going back a few nights later  We got there too early for the kitchen to be open but the chef opened it for us  The food was awesome  You really have to try the U Peel shrimp and duck fat fries  We had Paige as our server both nights and she is phenomenal  She is very knowledgeable and personable  She made our evenings memorableCarmellas is a must when you are in South Side  Great atmosphere set by the eccentric decorations  Whether youre stopping in for a drink or a full meal the experience is great  I have only eaten here twice  once for dinner and once for brunch  Both were delicious The menu varies daily which means you are always surprised but pleasantly so  The drinks are also delicious  I tried a moscow mule since that is what they are known for  not my thing to begin with but it was still refreshing  They have an expansive whiskey selection and you can become a member so to speak and they will keep track of the ones you have tried  They also make a mean manhattan and old fashion  Highly recommended for a meal andor drinks"

    "review":"I love this place Except they need Real plates Fried eggs off of styrofoam just doesnt get er done Bring cash as plastic is a no goCane here for a late lunch with friends probably about 15 hours before they closed The food was good and I had a BLT and the got Chicken Clubs However our server was extra grumpy which kind of made the experience a little unsettling However I would go again for breakfast foodsGood basic breakfast diner  No thrills Eggs and meats all overdone unless you ask otherwise No butterIts a classic diner and doesnt pretend to be anything else  Breakfast places seem to hard to find these days  Scrambled eggs bacon toast and tea were served as ordered for 6  If you want to pay three times as much for the same meal visit one of the local hotelsWe were fortunate to be able to grab a table for 5 of us for breakfast on a Saturday morning  We opted to try something with cherries on it pancake with cherries but really there wasnt anything particularly special about the cherries  It just taked like the cherry pie preserves from a jarOtherwise food was just fine  Sausage links were odd in the sense that they were skinny  A decently priced 67 per meal breakfast option in downtown PittsburghWas visiting Pittsburgh to bring my daughter as an incoming freshman to Duquesne University Was staying at the Wyndham Grand downtown and all I wanted was a traditional diner breakfast Found Cherries at Market Square and I got excited Went in there and all the employees were sitting down watching tv Lady came over to me to take my order but sounded like a high efficiency robot Came off extremely rude the way she was in such a hurry She looked at me crazy when I said I wanted my bacon deep fried Where Im from south central PA this is common to get bacon truly crispy Anyway I got the special for 699 2 eggs homefries bacon and 1 pc of French toast Everything was prepared ok but the potatoes They were chunky soggy and greasy probably were sitting awhile Stuff was not made to order but the eggsI waited like 5 min for my entire order Maybe Im spoiled I grew up on diner food because my mom was a server This diner was not anything I was used to Not to mention where I live you can get 2 eggs homefries and toast for 199 So a breakfast like this would be far less But still not a bad price for downtown Pittsburgh just overall not entirely pleased Thats why just 2 stars"

    "review":"This is the best pizza in Oakland That is saying a lot because there are several good places in the area Since the location is a bit away from the center of Oakland this place can get very busy for dining in I have found the best time to go is about 1pm on weekdays The hospital people usually fill the place at 11am and the office types jam the place at noon If your going to eat there make it a late lunchMy only complaint is the location and like another reviewer has stated they dont often deliverIf you want a good deal then come here Their pizza is out of this world and very affordable The customer service is amazing too I pick this place over Milanos any day They know my order and my name and very personableWe stayed at the quality inn near the universities and wanted some pizza Found this place on yelp  Great NY style pizza Family owned so they want customers to be pleased You can get a simple garden salad for 3 and a chef salad for 350Great food at relatively cheap prices Their steak hoagie is great I cant tell you about anything else because that is all I getOMG Finally A pizza shop that doesnt charge 8 for a head of lettuce and a hand full of veggies The food is pretty good and very affordable The only problem I have is that my workplace puts in a 300 order every friday and they never throw out any deals Not that they have to but it would at least show that they value and appreciate their customers business"

    "review":"Im not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to McDonalds In fact I hate it I quit eating it about ten years ago that is until someone decided that after they took my order for Burger King and they werent open that they would run here to get food LAMEI wasnt going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid so I caved and let them bring me food from here I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid I picked at it played with it complained about it and if I could have I would have fed it to a dog However I view that as animal crueltyI give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in  Thats all my tongue sensed I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom cursing each time Remember beggars cant be chooser So when it comes to McDonalds panhandle elsewhereIt is a McDonalds in the middle of Oakland It is a fast food chain and they are usually busy The only good thing is that they are open 24 hours so you can always get your late night greasy snack I had a coupon so I went there I wouldnt pick it for an every day mealI never waited less than 40 min for ordering And another 10 min for my burger to be ready But it is well worth it The best burger in townHorrible customer service all around Manager flat out called me a liar over 20 chicken nuggets and refused to refund me Will not go backPretty much like most urban McDonalds Decent service the food just as you expect it I just got a cheeseburger and the 1 large sweet tea to get out of the heat and work on my computerThe store wasnt the cleanest when I was there WiFi was very fast but outlets hard to findThis McDonalds is so dirty The food comes out good but its the same as McDonalds everywhere else I try to limit my time in here because the floor looks gross and the tables are disgusting One time I had to go to the bathroom super bad and I went into the one here and I turned around and left right away and decided it would be better to pee myself"

    "review":"Great little place  Owners are outstanding people  like family cooking your meal  Each visit is a wonderful experience  seem to always see someone there we know NICE :Everyone Ive told about this place has become a regular its that good  Homemade pasta every day great specials and a family restaurant feel  Family favorites include hot pepper soup ahi tuna 20 bottles of wine and anything with the garlic cream sauce   Not open for lunch right nowPleasant  Fun AtmosphereExcellent service  woohoo PaulaEvery menu item ordered  wed definitely order again  CCs Veal  oh my  Mr got a prime rib special wmushroom risotto hummahumma  I brought the bone home to lunch on tomorrowBoth daughters ordered pasta dishes  asking us  while eating why weve never brought them here before   Deeeeelicious   talentedkitchenstaff I will say the food was decent but the wait in between courses was unbearable My husband and I went to dinner and we were fairly hungry  a plus if you going out to eat The wait for a table was average but it took over 2 hours after we were seated to get salads Another 90 minutes bf the main course We were so famished by the time we got our meals that we ate quickly By that time we just asked for our check which took another 45 minutes The server was nice but dont go there unless you are not that hungry and you plan to spend all night thereI ate here last night for dinner with my girlfriend after reading some of the reviews on Yelp  The outside of the restaurant is hohum and not much to look at but the inside is quaint and quite niceWe were seated almost immediately in a booth and told of the many different specials that they had that evening  Since we were trying to make it to a movie we decided to forgo an appetizer and have entrees only  For my entree I decided upon the Russian shrimp which had shrimp mushrooms and artichokes in a vodka sauce while my girlfriend decided on the pasta al pesto with chicken  They were both served with homemade pasta and we were delighted when given the choice between linguine angel hair penne or pepper linguine  Both my girlfriend and I ended up choosing the pepper linguine  Shortly after ordering our server came out with some nice slices of Italian bread paired with an olive oil and spice dipping sauce oregano and other items which tasted wonderfully  Both of our entrees also came with salads that were mixed and plated table side much to our surprise  The salad had a nice house dressing on it and tasted nicely especially with the Gorgonzola cheese on the side which the server recommended  With both the salad and bread being delicious I was really looking forward to our entrees  After they came out I first tried the pasta al pesto and it was delicious with the sauce matching the pepper pasta perfectly  Then I tried my dish and I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed  The vodka sauce seemed watered down and by that I mean that it had a watery consistency and was very bland almost like water had been added at the very end  That made my meal somewhat disappointing as everything else in it was good and cooked perfectly  It also dropped what would have been a five star review down to fourThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future  Everything except for my sauce was fantastic and I would go so far as to call this place a hidden gem  With that comment though I really want to think that the sauce that I had was a mistake and not what it is normally likeOne of the best Pittsburgh restaurants that no one talks aboutBeet  goat cheese salad is a mustButternut Squash Ravs Yum"

    "review":"The second location for the owner Josh of Istanbul Grille after the one at USX His food is always great though its a bit pricey for the quantity I would come here almost 23 times a week Reviewing it so other Yelpers can see the businesses 2nd locationI had always wanted to go to this restaurant for lunch but never quite seemed to make it over to the USX tower Imagine how excited I was to find out that they moved a 2nd location into the old Keystone Cafe Which I thought sucked anyway Glad THATs gone A few of my coworkers went earlier this week and described it to me as kind of a buffet which I was glad to hear because that means that there would likely be more offerings than what you typically see in chain restaurants that serve food from this part of the world eg gyro meat hummus yogurt etc And I was rightUpon walking in I saw that there were at least 1215 side dishes  some I knew some I did not Heres the cool part: when it was my turn I told the guy how happy I was that they opened in this location and that I was very excited to try some new things I ordered Meal 3 which is supposed to be a salad with 3 cold sides but I ended up with a sampler box He generously gave me little spoonfuls of almost everything on the serving table and he was funny and charming while doing it I ended up with this:The base was a green salad with a very light but very flavorful vinegarbased dressing cucumber salad yogurt with dill and pine nuts grape leaves chic peas with tahini beet salad roasted red pepper and jalepeno sauces hummus and spicy roasted eggplantThe food itself is clearly planned and prepared by people who know Turkish food and it is out of this worldThe service the food and the price were right I will absolutely go back to Istanbul and will recommend it to everyone I know392016: UPDATEI went back today and the owner was just as friendly and funny as last time He truly treats customers like friends I wish I could work for this guyFirst time herethis location  I have been going for years  I remember when Josh was where Yovis used to be on liberty  I frequent USX several times a month  This is much more space  The food is just as good  No falafel when I went  The chicken pita was great  Josh has best baba in Pittsburgh  Dont leave with out trying some sides  Nothing to be intimidated by everything is great  If you are vegan many options and even a vegan baba  Keep up the passion for great food  A definite gem in the Pittsburgh culinary scene  If you leave here hungry you must never get filled upExcellent food  I live nearby and Im a huge fan of this place  The owner is welcoming and generousJosh is back He makes the best Turkish food ever It is fresh healthy and tastes so good I always get the lamb or chicken with salad and sides You have to try the sides he makes fresh You will not leave hungry and your wallet will not get hit hard Love this place my go to place a few times a weekFresh flavorful and filling Outstanding food and service The gentleman in front of me today did not know it was cash only and the owner told him he could pay double next time This kind of service is what brings people back Although I would come back even if the service was terrible bc the food is outrageous Currently my favorite lunch spot in Pgh I love all the sides you get The carrot slaw cucumbers hummus chickpea salad lentil salad etc all deserve to be on my platter Well done"

    "review":"As a disclaimer I havent been here for dinner yet but Ive stopped by for happy hour regularly This is not a happening place but it is incredibly unique They have a very interesting location in the South Side Slopes with a little parking lot The decor is very nice with dark wood nice linens and flowers around Every time I go for happy hour I have a nice evening They have great food specials including giant sandwiches and wings Seriously you dont need more than 6 wings so at 30 cents a pop for happy hour thats dinner If you order too many theyre happy to wrap the wings up for you in a doggy bagVisited for the fist time tonight Low key place with a limited menu of very good selections Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food and the portions are generous My wife had an interesting strip steak with a Rainer Cherry and onion sauce that we both enjoyedThey have a selection of some 50 wines for 25 a bottle and the home made tiramisu was very good We had a pleasing CotesduRhone with our mealA couple can have a bottle of wine two appetizers two entress and a large dessert for less than 100My husband and I live in the neighborhood and by default come to UUBU6 quite often for dinner during the week lots of regulars from the Southside slopes here The food is usually a hit rarely a miss foie gras on waffles and guacamole on crabs are a resounding no but most everything else an absolute yes The usual American fares as well as Eastern European ones really shine here never have I ever had better pierogies than at UUBU6 soft and pillowy while drowning in butter Why yes I will happily stuff myself with these pierogies made of angel dust That massive delicious burger that comes on homemade buns is a musttry too Everything comes in huge portions and we usually end up having to take half of our food home as next days lunch Dont miss dessert here there is usually an excellent array of homemade tarts pies and cakes Mike the chef makes all the desserts and the breads which are consistently delicious  I could eat Mikes apple tarte tatin everyday for the rest of my life happily The beer specials usually 23beer dont hurt either The servers Tom who wears many hats here including bartender and coowner with his brother Mike the chef and Diane are great and are part of the reason why we keep coming back to this neighborhood jointGreat little hidden placefriendly staffgreat food Diane waitress takes the cake thoughshes hysterically awesomeUubu 6 is a bit tiny but its pretty unique We came for Thanksgiving dinner and if you can use it as a basis for the rest of their food its pretty goodAs the below poster said: they bake bread in house We got the most delicious fresh warm rye bread and I typically hate rye with a plate of tasty melty butter Next was a delicious mushroom bisque followed by a decent salad with pomegranates raspberries and walnuts They served a good but typical Thanksgiving plate with all the fixins For desert was a dense chocolate cake and I suspect flourless which was quite goodThey have a large wine menu and recently have added a 20 bottle page Also our server was an incredibly friendly and pleasant despite the stress she must have been under due to the high volume of large families coming in Parking is kind of a pain though the lot for customers can probably only fit 6 cars luckily they have a valet to deal with that There is street parking across from it but theres no sidewalk I would drop your guests off at the restaurant before parking on South 18th Street as your passenger side will be extremely unpleasant to get out ofBeing that Im the first Pittsburgher to review UUBU6 it pains to me rate this typically superb restaurant with only 2 stars But unfortunately last Saturday night my lofty expectations fell well short of what we had experienced here before We arrived early for our reservation at this funky spot up the hill on the South Side and decided to have a drink at the cool bar of what used to be the Workingmans Beneficial Union No 6 lodge somehow they get UUBU6 out of all of that I was excited to see a large beer tub full of one of my favorite beers Blue Point Hoptical Illusion and quickly ordered two for the guys Our ladies each decided on a pomegranate martini which were so strong even I had a hard time taking a sip The four of us were seated in the grand main dining room with the yellow and green checker board ceiling and the dramatic yellow drapery But unfortunately after we sat down the staff forgot we were there We waited almost 20 minutes until a server approached us and asked if we were ready to order I said we would be happy to order if we had menus You can see where this night was headed The server apologized and quickly returned with our menus  UUBU6s menu tonight looked nothing like the menu on the website it does say menu subject to change upon the Whim of the Chef  but I have to say we were very disappointed with the nights offerings The entire first page was a Lenton menu  this was a Saturday night with 810 seafood specials But the biggest disappointment was the fact that there was only one appetizer asparagus frito misto to go along with 3 or 4 salads Are you serious   The app selction on the website had so many different choices and our only option was asparagus which also happened to be the vegetable of the day  Fortunately I saw a very attractive cheese and fruit plate on the dessert cart next to our table and we decided to order it for our appetizer The waiter obliged and it was actually a very good selection of a Maytag blue a brie a borsin and a smoked Gouda to go along with the grapes strawberries crackers and bread The wine list is extensive and is attached to every menu so after finally settling on a bottle of wine we were sorry to learn that it was unavailable Our server suggested a similar California Red from the 20 bottle list I was confused because none of our menus had this value list So he returned with another menu and we were lucky to have a very good Cali Pinot Noir  The salads were just okay with a bloodorange vinaigrette  Nothing to get excited about   But  my seafood bisque was very flavorful and hearty My lady ordered the Hangar steak with mustard sauce and sweet potato fries Our server informed us that he thought they were out of it so he asked her for a plan B in case it was unavailable After another 20 minutes we motioned to our server to see if she was getting the hangar steak and he informed us that there indeed was one left We wished there hadnt been because the steak came out a little overcooked but drowning in mustard flavor But her biggest disappointment was that the accompanying fries werent sweet potato just plain ordinary steak fries She wouldnt have ordered the steak if she had known they were out of sweet potatoes and our server again neglected to mention this to us As for my dish I went in ready to order either a duck or a lamb dish from the website but of course neither were on tonights menu  So I decided on the soft shell crabs with spring onion and tomato relish I chose poorly  The salsa on top was just that chopped tomato and sliced green onion   But that was the least of my entrees problem The soft shells were so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising with each bite It was almost laughable but by now I was too hungry to send them back Apparently it was contagious because the accompanying asparagus also seemed to be inflicted with this same salt problem In fairness our dining companions enjoyed their dishes I especially liked his Angus beef tenderloin we like to try each others dishes but his wifes salmon dish was a little on the dry side The dessert cart again none of the desserts on the website were on the cart tonight sells itself with the elegantly arranged trays of small cakes and pastries The ladies Chocolate flourless cake wasnt very aweinspiring but a strawberry Napoleon with whipped cream was sublime All things considered and because of my 50 gift certificate thanks WPXI Just Pay Half our final tally came to 65 per couple  All things considered UUBU6 can give you a pretty good bang for your buck with the 20 wine list and also a 30 recession buster prix fix feature   So as you can see you can get pretty good value here   As long as the kitchen and waitstaff  rekindle the commitment to excellence that I had come to expect when UUBU6 first ascended up the slopes of the South Side"

    "review":"This is a small romantic modern French restaurant with eclectic decor quiet background music interestingly I thought I heard a Lady Gaga song and excellent wait staff Our first time there we had an excellent meal from start to finish with fish and chips appetizer its not what youre thinking of delicious pasta and vegetarian entrees and a unique chocolate mousse dessert The food at our second visit didnt seem as inspired as on our initial visit The fish and chips appetizer was very good but not great My wifes vegetarian dish a cassoulet wasnt as tasty as the roasted vegetable dish she had ordered before My salmon was very good though Food presentation was superb both visits The wait staff was quite attentive and the service was quick Appetizers were in the 15 range and most entrees were in the lower 30s With the small entree sizes youll want to get an appetizer with your meal Also be aware that parking can be difficult since you have to fend for yourself with whatever street parking is available For the price Id pick Casbah just a short walk down the streetI stopped by here two nights ago for my birthday dinner with my wife  The Twisted Frenchman was my choice because I had been eyeing up their tasting menu for awhile but at 90person it seemed like too much of a splurge for a normal evening out  I made the reservations through the Yelp app a couple of days ahead of time and had no problem getting the 7 PM time that I desired  My wife and I ended up arriving at the restaurant about 10 minutes before our reservation which wasnt a problem as we were immediately seated at a table along the wall which was fairly private  The inside of the Twisted Frenchman is actually decorated quite nicely in a simple manner with grey tablecloths and napkins and a large decoration in the center of the ceiling consisting of a bunch of cylinders of glass that were in different colors and sizesAfter being greeted by our server and having water served to us I asked about the tasting menu and then noted that I had allergies to chocolate and red wine  Our server didnt seem to think that was going to be a problem and so we both ordered the tasting menu  A couple of minutes later our server came back out to ask me if it was ok if the chef cooked some of my food in red wine since it will cook off  I explained to him that it wasnt and he went back into the kitchen and I knew it wasnt good whenever he came back with the regular menus  He explained to me that the chef couldnt cook enough dishes without red wine and so we would have to order from the a la carte menu  What kind of chef is unwilling to accommodate someones food allergies  I have never had a problem with this before and at most chefs tastings they have actually asked me if I had any allergies so that they would not make something that i cant eat  Apparently this chef just didnt feel like making an effort that night  The server proceeded to then point out three appetizers and two entrees that I could actually eat and noted that I could also have the steak and lamb entrees but without the demi glace  Interestingly neither of those items even mentioned a demi glace on the menu  Since at that point the menu was so confined for me my wife and I left the restaurant and used the 200 we were planning on spending at the Twisted Frenchman to have a nice dinner elsewhereThe bottom line for me is that I will never come back here again in the future and would advise others to avoid it as well  What kind of a chef cant make dishes whenever they are handicapped by a single ingredientParty of four on a Tuesday night and we were very pleasantly surprised Pittsburgh has a lot of fancy and expensive restaurants many of which I feel dont deliver either a unique experience or good value The Twisted Frenchman gets it right beginning with the atmosphere Good bistro feel with a laid back but attentive approach to serviceWe were presented with the wine list and our server was obviously an enthusiastshe not only was able to describe the different offerings we were welcome to try anything on the list before making a final selection Turns out our initial choice was not as good as our second so we were able to hone in on a winnerThe menu is varied and carries such real bistro fare as sturgeon squab and duckThe appetizers cured salmon and fois gras were a touch over done however when we brought the salmon to the servers attention apparently it is a style of cooking you either love or you dontThe mains however were fantasticA rack of lamb you could cut with a knife a ricotta dish that made our toes curl and steak that was the best we ever tasted Presentation was simple but attractive and the service the the right level of careWe finished off with two desserts shared the clear winner a frozen chocolate dish that was just right in its tartnessDinner for two with a glass of wine each around 120 not including tipDefinitely on the go back list if only to see if they can knock it out of the park again with different selectionswe heard great things about this place so we had to try it what better time than for valentines day  my birthdaywe read there was valet parking there wasnt lets just say i wasnt dressed to walk 4 blocks in a wind stormthe staff was welcoming  we were seated immediately we went with the 8 course tasting with paired wines let me say EVERYTHING was ridiculously DELICIOUS best french food ive had in a long time HOWEVER i felt like i was on an assembly line it seemed as though everyone was having the tasting menu it was as if all they did was make the tasting menu so it came quick  fast: every dish perfectly the same which is what you want i know just not that perfect i watched as the chef went to each table saying the same rote speech as he poured the nitrogen over the dessert he didnt seem to be feeling itit got pretty loud too as the people drank more again i get thats what they want but for a romantic quiet meal for 2 nah we had to yell to talk to each otherid give it another try but id order off the menu  maybe go on a week night instead of the weekend  id wear better shoes for walkingNicely displayed dishes but the taste is not as sophisticated as the presentation I had sturgeon the beat appetizer and the chocolate moose The sturgeon tasted like simple salmon and the chocolate moose was too watery The signature drink was OK but very strong The service was mixed We had a reservation At the entrance no one was waiting to seat us After a bit of hesitation we decided to go inside and see what we should do We almost were entering the kitchen area at the back of the restaurant when someone finally told us to sit somewhere It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was not busy at all But the rest of the service that night was goodThe appetizer beets was great   The entree duck was also quite good   The vanilla dessert was definitely not worth the calories   The folks at the table who got the chocolate dessert seemed happier with their choice    If you go before sundown make sure that you dont sit facing the windows as the sun reflecting off the windows across the street is blinding    The servers were clearly aware of the problem but had no fix except to tell us to wait 15 minutes until the sun went down     The servers were otherwise properly attentive but not overbearing for a high end restaurant"

    "review":"This place gets REALLY packed on the weekends and a lot of meat heads and dbags hang out there  However the prices are good the bartenders are rather pleasant and its off the main path of carson so its a nice beginning to a night or last stopFriendly atmosphere inexpensive drinks good bar food daily food  drink specials  Tuesday is 2 beer and 1 taco nights plus trivia game  I can see this place becoming that special neighborhood bar where everybody knows your nameOne negative  the jukebox is waaay too loud  Cant have a conversation with the other people at the bar when its onAll in all a great start to successWent here because it was near a friends place and our last night in Pittsburgh  It happened to be the last game of the Penguins NHL Playoff run sorry fellas and also an 80s night with a DJ playing music to barely anyone  But what I gather from this place is that it is very neighborhoody and literally everyone is local  They dont have a full bar but most of the clientele seems of the Bud Light persuasion  Seems like a cool place to chill if this is your hood  Sports barish but more divey than anything elseUnfortunately this bar closed a couple months ago But I still wanted to give it a review because I fell in love with the place It was a local bar with cheap beers and great specials 2 dollar you call it every evening Huge projector screen for pens games but most importantly the staff and owner were great people I was really sad to see they closed downThis used to be a great bar  The new owners should have changed the name because it is dragging the old Jaggerbush name through the mud  We stopped in for the grand reopening with the DJ this past Saturday Our bartender was more worried about plugging in her phone than getting people beer  Now that the taps have been moved to the back wall you cant see them  and its not a good sign when your bartender doesnt know Whats on tap  When asked if the Dogfish Head was the 60 minute or 90 minute she came back and told me it was the craft beer  It wasnt overly busy  but it took a long time to get a new beer when we needed a refill  and they ran out of the beer special an hour in  And the back up special  and back up special  Our bartender did nothing to tell us what beer they DID have  we just had to keep guessing beer until we picked one they had  And there is something to be said about actually serving a beer and just having it slapped down in front of you and your money taken with no regards to the customer  At the end of the night she tried to tell me she didnt have my credit card  and we couldnt get out of there fast enough  Very sad to see a great bar run so horriblyPudding shots Jukebox Sunday potluck for Stillers games The best affordable taplist in South Side always changing and always featuring something for everyone The staff is friendly and the barfood is satisfyingnot to mention the beautiful historic building its been a bar for over a century and features a builtin wooden barback as well as the classic South Side ceilingsI spent many nights in grad school taking my work to the Jaggerbush to write papers and drink my stress away for good formI spent even more nights putting Wagon Wheel Confessions Part II and I Believe in a Thing Called Love on the jukeboxBest dive in South Side If youre coming in for a night out hit up this place first for a relaxed atmosphere or hit it up last for some good old fashioned debauchery and pudding shots"

    "review":"The food was quite good on my first visit and it is great to see more places with a traditional Hong Kong menu to order from  What it lacks in interior design it made up for in quality of the dishes  Definitely worth a check out and located in a convenient spot for the academics  The fotos of the food in the entry are pretty helpful tooFood is actually not bad here Reminds me of homestyle food in Hong Kong The main problem is that the owner is a bit nosy Once she realized that I spoke Cantonese she proceeded to ask me when I immigrated to the United States I answered whom I came with I answered  how come my father didnt come with us  and were my parents divorced and thats why my father didnt come with us I didnt answer I just had that blank look I am a 30 year old woman so its a bit weird to have a stranger asking about my family background Its a lot more information than I would like to share considering that I just wanted some lunch I agree with another reviewer that she did not treat her servers very well On one occasion she yelled at the server for working too slowly in front of other customers and we were a bit uncomfortable with that scene Other than that the food is fine I would recommend takeouts to minimize interactions hahaIf youre looking for authentic Cantonese food Ka Mei is for you  Because its your only Cantonese option in Pittsburgh So if youre judging based solely on Pittsburgh its the best But otherwise its actually rather average Cantonese cuisine relies heavily on fresh ingredients and not necessarily spices So yes you can get a Cantonese styled steam fish here But its made from a frozen fish So i dont blame the chef or Ka Mei its just were in PittsburghI only come here when Im feeling homesick otherwise if you just want some Chinese food whether its Cantonese or not I recommend Rose Tea As for service I dont usually recommend a Chinese restaurant if your main objective is service I believe the owner is from Hong Kong And true to the style of Hong Kong servers she speaks to you in a familiar tone but can also be curt sometimes Which is ok with me like I said I come here if Im feeling homesick Ka Meis preserved egg and pork congee is pretty decentSadly I will have to give it a soso review overall I have had take out from them twice and never dined here but it did seem fairly clean and bright mixed with a lobby that has pictures of many of their specialties adorning the walls Though a bit tacky it was very nice to see what the dishes looked like The vegetables were very fresh and that was the best thing about this place However both times I got about 78 different dishes total the meals simply lacked flavor When I have to apply fair amounts of salt and soy sauce to enjoy the meal I am disappointedI love the food here every single time The general tso is the absolute best around in Pittsburgh The owner is very kind and the resturant us well kept I always recommend Ka MeiThis is one of the few Chinese restaurants that seem to be primarily concerned with catering to their Chinese clientele And I respect that In fact the reason I ventured in to Ka Mei was on the recommendation of a Chinese friend A very picky Chinese friend at that Like other restaurants Ka Mei offers both AmericanChinese food and authentic dishes Ive opted for the latter and have not been disappointed Their food seems lightly seasoned and notably fresh You can taste the different elements I admittedly tend to prefer stronger flavors but I appreciate Ka Mei as a change of pace And its the only place I know of that serves dou miao snow pea greens when in season"

    "review":"Ive been to Sals twice So take my review with a grain of salt It was fairly new the first time I visited I ordered the grilled cheese with fries Pretty good lunch but I was more impressed with the service Friendly waitress and an attentive cook who came and visited my table So I was pleased and decided to bring my fiancee in a few months laterAwful experience Ordered the lil sal burger and baked cod We sat and conversed for around 25 minutes and began to realize people around us who were sat ten minutes after us were beginning to get their food I asked the waitress about our orders since I work in the city and had to return to work soon and she told me that the burger takes awhile and the fish isnt quick either That statement is sad and overblown Ive had both in dozens of places in the city and never had an issue So we waited another ten minutes and decided to ask for the check The manager came over and gave us the same reason and asked us not to leave so he didnt have to waste food The guilt trip ploy worked and we waited During our wait the chef meandered on by and briefly told us that the oven temps were low and thats why the fish was slow Eventually the manager who was not very pleasant brought us a to go bag While the meal was covered I cant say Ill go back anytime soonFood was alright much better when you are able to sit and eat it while it is warmIve walked by this place dozens of times and never went before today After stopping in I regret not going in sooner I walked in placed a takeout order and was back out the door in less than 10 minutes While it was a little more expensive then what Id normally want to spend on lunch the quality of the food more than made up for it The beef on weck was tender and juicy even before dipping the sandwich in the au jus I especially like the touch of a horseradish spread It really pushed the sandwich over the top for me The housemade chips were fine There was nothing bad about them but nothing exceptional either Overall this was a great meal Ill definitely be back againSandwiches packed with meat and nice and hot so you can tell it is fresh All the sandwiches come with homemade crispy chips and a pickle on the side This deli is very busy everyday and I can see why The sandwich I had was the classic Reuben with chips It was packed to the fullest with corned beef and sauerkraut with the 1000 island dressing gives it the perfect kick to make it the perfect hot sandwich I would reccomend this deli for all meals of the dayI had walked past this restaurant too many times to count and finally got a chance to try it out recently when I had down time between ushering shows at the BenedumSals has both a dine in area and take out options  There is a separate entrance for the take out  The inside is colorfully decorated with several Burton Moris prints and other Pittsburgh and arts related items  Smart considering their location in the cultural districtThe menu offers more then just the typical deli  There were quite a few normal deli selections but they also had things like beef of wick hot roast beef on a kimmuleck roll and a potato pancake Ruben  They also had several soup appetizer and salad options  It was a nice variety more then you might expect from a deli  I started with the fried pickles  They were tasty but nothing to write home about  I had thought about ordering potato pancakes but changed my mind when I ordered the potato pancake Ruben as my entree  You had the option to have the Ruben with corned beef chicken or turkey  I chose turkey  The sandwich was HUGE   And the potato pancakes very tasty   it came with a side of apple sauce sour cream pickle and house made potato chips  The sandwich was so large I wish that I had not ordered an appetizer  Service was quick and attentive  Even though almost every table was full the server make sure water glasses were full and everything was going well with their patrons  Sals also has a great selection of desserts  I wanted to order the cannoli but they were sold out so I got the salted Carmel brownie  It comes with a scoop of ice cream and was very tastyOverall I really enjoyed my visit to Sals and will likely be back  Especially with my frequent visits to the BenedumOMG that corned beef I had the Potato Pancake Reuben and it was ridiculous I dont know where they get that corned beef but it was out of this world best corned beef sandwich Ive had in my life YUMMMMWe were looking for something quick but good for lunch and healthy Very accommodating Seated quickly and service was on Busy place Ordered salads and wrap Not bad a little small I guess we needed to order something unhealthy to get super sized Probably a great place for burger or traditional sandwich Homemade chips were good filler"

    "review":"Horrible beer horrible service horrible menuBe careful The servers cant pay attention to save their lives and the management cares even less I want to make sure people know how careless the management is particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run aroundThis place is quite big with a bar area dining room area and patio area We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TVs They also have darts and two pool tables which I really enjoy When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share It was a pretty delicious meal but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall but I didnt really get them It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront areaThe beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL Ive tried many things on the menu and if you have developed a foodie palate dont even bother because you will be very disappointed If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch which nothing wrong with that you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas minus the repulsive beans and rice and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer Otherwise you are better off skipping itThe food is standard American farea bit overpriced in my mindand the beers range from mediocre to very bad  The Klsch is the only decent beer of the bunch  The service is good but the wait for food or a table can be quite long generally 2030 minutes even for just beer and apps  Ive been to the one at the Denver airport as well but I was stranded and had free meal tickets so okaybutnothingspecial pizza from Rock Bottom it was  Since its a recognizable national chain I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craftbrew experienceErgh this place I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here Naturally Im not a stranger to this chain understand its a chain but the past visit here was just not goodCame with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money We were seated in the dining area Every time we are seated in the dining area its a bad experience On the bar side you get entertainment the beer flightsdraft specials are decent and the bar foodappetizers are passableIt started off with the soft drinks Im not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky and yes I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular There was incorrect carbonation whether they were running out I suspect this no ice lukewarm or they had just hooked up a new box unlikely I sent it backMy brother got a burger which he said was fine it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied I tried to steal a few of his fries which were a failure They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section a full mouth of starch and were barely crispy enough So abandon plan On my own dish I had the classic mac n chicken First of all the pasta was crispy really it wasnt a cheese sauce it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs And when I say smothered here this is not a good thing Sigh The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish and said it was cooked properly A small save Again  I sent it back after about 3 bites The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box I told her to take it away She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check which I didnt see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom I hope they didnt charge us for the pop drink Needless to say I came home hungry Honestly if you come come for drinks and a salad they dont screw those up Everything else avoid"

    "review":"Indian Spices is a fairly new addition to the Cultural District dining scene  Its nice to have a goodtasting Indian option Downtown and its also nice to see a relatively inexpensive restaurant open here expect to pay 750  14 for a dinner entree or 750 for the lunch buffet  Unfortunately the atmosphere in the restaurant isnt as nice as I had hopedGood points first:  We really enjoyed most of the dishes we had here  Pappadums were warm and crispy with some sort of spicy seed baked into them unlike the plain pappadums you get at a lot of restaurants here  Both the mint sauce and the onion relish were very nice  For our entrees we both ordered dishes marked as chefs specialties  I ordered a vegetarian entree with paneer and okra which was perfectlycooked:  the paneer and okra had been sauteed with onions until both paneer and okra were slightly browned but not overdone  This let the okra keep its flavor without getting the sliminess that okra can have  My husband ordered lamb pasanda which turns out to be lamb in a sweet and spicy creamy sauce with cashews and raisins in it  This was one of the most delicious lamb dishes either of us has had in a very long time  The garlic naan was good too the garlic was cut in rough slivers and baked with the naan so that it had a roasted tasteThe bad parts of our meal:  Samosas were not good: the outermost part looked and felt promisingly crispyflaky but the crust turned out to be a little bit gummychewy on the inside which I do not like  Additionally the potato and pea filling was distressingly homogenous and not very well spiced  But the accompanying tamarind sauce was excellent    Maybe samosa chat would be better  The restaurant itself is kind of cold in temperature and austere in appearance:  the walls are all painted varying shades of grayishpurple which I find oppressive and the occasional small kitschy wall hanging does nothing to relieve the overall foreboding aspect of the dining room  Worst of all the service was not good  Our waitress acted as if the presence of diners in her dining room was the only obstacle preventing her from attaining enlightenment  She was not very good at answering questions  When we asked what onion bhajiya another specialty was she replied onion rings  Upon looking it up later I discovered that they are not onion rings  They are actually basically onion pakoras  Furthermore she wasnt particularly attentive and when we asked about dessert options she gave us a disapproving look me in particular and said Dessert as if we should be ashamed to even consider eating more food in a restaurantAll in all we will probably come back here since so much of the food was good and that lamb pasanda was REALLY good  We will also probably stick mainly to the chefs specialty items and we might order takeout next timeWorst food experienced tomato soup is thick cream and sour in taste coming to biryani it was tastelessness bad taste but mango lassi was awesomeIndian Spices is my goto place for Indian Food in Pittsburgh Each of the 5 or 6 times I have gone there in the last three years the food was delicious You can set the spice level for what you order on a scale of 15 and it is not an Americanized scale Higher numbers are quite spicyThe prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is casual The servers are fairly attentive and politeExcellent and authentic overallOwners daughter is the hostess and compared to the next door competitor other hostess is old lady their food is more tastyReasonably pricedLiked all nonveg dishes and Chicken Makhni is specially smooth  nice Veg dishes like Saagchole spinachchickpea karipakoda is worth mentioning Sometimes they have Biriyani which is niceBut in desert they loose a star     as  they do not feature Gulab Jamun as often as they should Instead its always kheer every time I wentStaff is very friendly I recommend the lunch buffet its a solid value and the dishes rotate so you can try something new each time You can even get the lunch buffet to go with fresh naan if you are in a hurry If you are sensitive to spice it can sneak up on you here but Ive always enjoyed it This place does the little things right from the subtle seasoning in the rice to the standard dishes like chicken tikka masalaBest food ever  Had a family dinner and so satisfied with service and taste of food Best thing is they can make mild hot or extra hot exact proportions No words  Just give a try and you will be writing review like me"

    "review":"My husband and I decided to try Cibo as it was part of a discount card fundraiser we had signed up for  when I looked at their websitemenu online they identified themselves as gluten free friendly and more than happy to accommodate any allergydietary needs and as a GF girl anytime an Italian place says they have GF pasta Im pretty happy We dined on a Saturday evening with reservations I usually try and keep it pretty positive when it comes to reviewing restaurants but our experience was the complete opposite of positive and I hope some changes can be made their in the future because their food had some great elements  their owner was nice but other than thatugh When I mentioned that I am GF and asked if I could get the Chicken Parm but without breadcrumbs which I would normally not even think to ask for but since they had identified themselves as being willing to accomodate allergies I went ahead and asked I was told the chef is busy and wouldnt want to do that but that he could just put some grilled chicken on top of the pasta but she didnt want to ask him to make it parmesan style even though Im pretty sure that would just consist of putting some sauce and cheese on top I can understand when things are busy it is hard to accomodate special requests even simple ones like mine but as a customer who is paying 20  for dinner I dont think I should have to worry about if my order will stress the chef out Either dont claim to be GF friendly or get some more kitchen help In the end I ended up paying a pretty high price for noodles marinara sauce  grilled chicken : Our waitress only smiled when she was dropping off the check  we only smiled when we could finally leaveStopped here for a meal before going to the nearby theater Owner was very friendly and they were able to get us through the meal in less than hourso we made the movieBYOB allergy friendly and with wonderful Frenchpress coffee Everything put on the table was excellentHowever this is a 4 start experience than a 5 star because the portions were tiny Think 22 for a Vongole pasta dish which had at most 3 ounces of pasta Tasty by every measure but it was about 2 per fork full of pastaAll the salads were were exceptionally good but a bit on the smaller sideAgain great simple foodjust not enough of it at these prices I would however visit againWonderful food great service and fair prices We got the flatbread and half portions of the linguine and ravioli OutstandingThis is NOT the old Cibos  The dishes are creative and the flavors and preparations are amazing We had the duck confit as an appetizer  this made us take notice  The Boston Bibb salad with radish and truffle oil was ascetically beautiful the aroma was fabulous and the taste was sweet and tender I had the lamb kabob and basmati rice and it was even more amazing than the duck My husband had the rabbit with greens and white beans which was just as delicious We finished with the salted Carmel custard which carried this meal over the top The fabulous service from Mary and visit to the table from Jen the chef made it beyond expectations HOME RUNI struggled between three and four stars  I gave the 4th star for effort   Service was fantastic and very welcoming   The food was good but there was plenty of room for improvement   I had the Lamb Shank at 2700 which was very flavorful but slightly overdone   The accompanying risotto was delicious but was somewhat overwhelmed by tomato sauce which was bitter    Orange cake for dessert which was flavorful but dry   The server immediately corrected by bringing me a very tasty Affogato    Overall I will go back in the near future and will recommend to other neighbors in the area    My portion was perfect    The pasta dishes were pleasing to my fellow dinersthough the portions were not overgenerousI went to Cibo for the first time since theyve reopened under new management IT IS FANTASTICFor a starter we had the mussels I can honestly say they were the best mussels Ive had in Pittsburgh As an entree I ordered the rabbit first time Ive had rabbit It was delicious The wait staff were super friendly and I loved the intimate atmosphere I will definitely be returningDont let the older negative reviews deter you from dining here Those reviews are from before they reopened under the direction of a new chef CIBO IS BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER"

    "review":"I went here a couple times then stopped  The bartenders are WAY to into themselves which is probably the reason the service sucks  What this place needs is people interested in serving the customer not posing  I dont need to be looked down on by the people slinging drinks And its too bad cause I like the ownerWe went for dinner here on a Monday evening around 8:30 and were seated immediately We were both astonished with the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and declared we loved it before we sat down The place seemed massive Our waitress was friendly and answered our questions we had I thought the service was exceptional and everyone who worked there was very polite We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Dip with pita bread and it was amazing Out waitress brought us more bread to finish it offI got the Pulled Turkey sandwich and it was good I felt a little full from the Dip so I didnt eat much of it Everyone seemed to rave about the wedges Im not sure why There wasnt anything amazing about them so that was a disappointmentAll in all I think Tender is a good place if youee looking for ambience and atmosphere but the food was sort of average To me I feel like theres nothing to really draw me backMade a reservation for 8 people when we visited home and ended up in the green room which is a lounge separate from the main bar areaThe waitstaff didnt tell us about the room and that we wouldnt be at regular tables Would be a nice area if you had a large party and wanted to mingle but we rearranged the couches and side tables a bit to make it more comfortable Had to unexpectedly limit what we could order nothing that really needed a knife and fork  hard to cut a steak on a coffee tableGenerally really yummy food shared a bunch of the small plates and pretty good service In the end felt like visiting a friends house who put up big  for a private chef and servers ha Just make sure you know what to expect if you make a reservationWe almost didnt go here because of some of the negative reviews  Were glad we ignored them  Yes the menu is limited But look theres a steak a chicken and a fish entre and a couple of burgers  My wife had the chicken and I had the fish  Both were excellent  We each had a small plate as well and again they were great  Okay if youre looking for a wine list and 6 cuts of beef try the Sonoma grill  but If you want a cocktail and a good meal with good service in a nice venue this place is hard to beatStopped in here for a couple of cocktails with a friend after putting it on my list a few months ago I was expecting an experience a bit different than what I got While the interior was nice I was kind of expecting a bit more of an upscale vibe and drink menu however the drinks were mostly tropical and fruity and the bartenders were wearing Hawaiian shirts I had no problem with this but the prices and decor should be in agreement with the drinks and dress code of the staff Overall I didnt know what kind of barrestaurant Tender was gunning for is it more of a laid back tropical oasis in the middle of Lawrenceville or is it upscale and trendy with a tropical infusion I really had no idea Maybe if I would have taken a look at the food menu I would have gotten a better idea but I left after one cocktail which I had no complaints aboutVery friendly and welcoming place  Limited menu Monday night burger night but the food was very good  Service was very good and the cocktails worked fine  Went with our 10yearold who was welcomed and greatly enjoyed the cream soda and root beer  Beautiful space"

    "review":"Love my hometown favorites Cannot beat their fish sandwiches although I do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced breadstop that Always will support EmilsOther favorites include Reuben Hawkins Avenue sandwich Chrissy ClubGreat food   service every visit They do so many things right there especially taking care of the customers  I have always received a hello a follow up on my food a thank you and then a good bye  Some many restaurants get away from these simple steps of service Im glad Emils has notI remember the old man 20 years ago eating a giant size hamburger used asked me questions I miss those days food there is spectacular the fish is to die at four if you never been there just put it on your schedule of your things to do and I promise you you wont be sorryThis is my fourth time but my first review It never disappoints Always home cooking old school like grandmas house Dont expect ambiance but if youre hungry and want nice wait staff usually family squeaky clean great value and generous portionsway more than I can ever finish Emils is your placeTonight I had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that was sooooo good Very obviously home made I had a side of onion rings that were perfectly cooked which doesnt sound fancy but I still couldnt finish My husband had the chicken parm Thursday is Italian night It came with a huge salad very fresh an entire loaf of Italian bread and a generous portion of nicely crisped and tender chicken breasts Added to that a side helping of ziti My husband enjoyed it very much the chicken was perfectly cooked Im a sauce snob Italian allergic to with an aversion to green peppers To me there was just a hint of green pepper in the sauce so I probably would avoid anything with red sauce at Emils but thats just my quirk Ive had the stuffed cabbages there the fried fish Ruebens burgers  all wonderful Emil was and his family is of Serbian decent Food is love We love EmilsI wouldnt say the best fish sandwich ive ever haddefinitely a huge portion but rather bland and nothing special Very nice people and good service but i would largely disagree with most of the reviews here Atmosphere was quite drab classic western pa corner bar but no windows poorly lit and overall fairly dismal Clientele seemed to be on deaths door missing limbs and morbidly obese Fries were frozen and under cooked Meatballs were dry and bland as well I had high hopes but left feeling disappointed defeated bloated and like i had swallowed the entire rustbelt in one biteExcellent fish sandwich Wonderful Reuben Sandwich even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade   Chrissy Is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome  Restaurant personnel are pleasant   I really enjoy visiting Emils when Im in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays   Worth the trip"

    "review":"We have visited here twice now One time to eat and one time for drinks I must say we do prefer the drinking here more than eating Aspinwall was in dyer need of a bar like this Its a laid back sports bar thats a notch higher than a dive Its clear they are still working out some kinks but thats to be expected to a brand new place The service has always been very welcoming and the drinks are a fair price The food is pretty standard bar food nothing out of the ordinary but its perfect for when youre drinking a beer and watching the game on one of their 12 tvs The four stars is for the residents of Aspinwall not to make the trip in to town for I hope they develop drink specials and some entertainment in the futureTVs are great Beer selection is not good On a slow night our food took FOREVER Our fries were cold burger burnt and bacon on the burger not cooked This was our 3rd time here and the experience has been the same every time Very sad because we were so hopefulJust browsing through restaurants nearby and wanted to add my take on Ordinary Joes  I live in Aspinwall for a little over a year now  The prices are high at Ordinary Joes because its close to Fox Chapel and lots of residents in and around AspinwallFox Chapel think they are high class folk with extra change to spare  That said if you order the wings you will not be sad with the price or the taste  Whole wings fried to order come piping hot with a few different flavors to pick from  Ive ordered at least 23 varieties and have been happy with each  The blue cheese dressing though I literally crave it  I have no idea if its homemade but it sure does taste like it  Its devine  Ordinary Joes is a nice not overly decorated bar with lots of TVs that is willing to put a nonPittsburgh sports game on even when the Penguins are playing  Delicious whole wings fantastic blue cheese dressing and out of state courtesy  Much more than I can say about the other bar down the street  I will return to Ordinary Joes again and again :Weve gone there a few times because its casual and an in between meeting place Salads are good Prices seem to be reasonable Last time we were there my son ordered a rare burger It came out well done He sent it back and the next one came out cooked even more It wasnt busy there and the waitress said they had a new cook At least they didnt charge us My wife enjoyed her grilled chicken salad and friends said their sandwiches were good I would go back there again Service was good We didnt sit in the bar area but the restaurant partContrary to some reviews we found the prices for drinks and especially food to be more than reasonable Great burger done exactly right Tons of food for 11 bucks Not a beer drinker so cant address that but good glass of wine for 7 Will revisit soon  Good service and speedy Very pleasantWas nervous to try this place based on the reviews not giving them much credit for what theyre doing  I found this to be a really neat wellset up bar that offered excellent service and really good food Its nothing super fancy bar food options but different than Tavern down the streets menuIt wasnt busy when we went on Friday at 9pm just a few people scattered throughout and sitting at the bars  I LOVE the fact that they have two rows of just bar style seating behind the actual bar  I think thats a really great idea for those that are going to watch a game on one of their many massive televisionsI forget our servers name but he took really great care of us and had a lot of recommendations  We started with the buffalo chicken dip on fresh chips and I requested extra celery  It was a very generous portion with SO many chips which is good because normally you run out of chips with your dip  I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad and Bobby ordered one of the burgers with fries  Both meals were excellent and large for the price  We both had left over when we were full from eatingFood and drink prices arent anything super cheap but comparable to what you will find at other bars in Awall  As I expected it was the typical Fox Chapel crowd  Its a nice place to go and catch a game and eat dinner or just stop in for a few drinks with friends  I really like the atmosphere and that it is close to home  Aspinwall needed something like this"

    "review":"what is it with Wendys   They never get the orders right If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to Even in Florida  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly sometimes cars are stuck on Baum blvd also the service is slow and poorThis place is well sanitized and has enough space to host lots of customers on rush hours It even has wonderful terrace seats You know that its very hard to find that kind of virtues around here Wendys cheese burger is definitely delicious Its patty is so juicy and breads are soft Drink option is cool too You can have free ice tea in side barMy only complaint is the size of burger Isnt it too small I am an Asian girl and dont eat too much but still I wasnt satisfied with the amount of itWorst wait times ever staff is inefficient It doesnt matter if the store if updated with a fancy facade wait times average 15 minutes to 40 minutes for drive through during peak times If youre going to run a fast food joint the keyword is fastFast food NOTBig corporate America places only get one shot w us We came here cause we got stuff to do quick trip to TARGET try to get child fed quickly and to bed on time SO LETS STOP AT Wendys right QuickSwing and miss Never againI visisted this Wendys often when I first started working nearby in Shadyside But I quickly learned my lesson I got tired of spending 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line No less than 20 minutes Every Single Time The drivethru is only slightly faster at 1015 mins Plus the staff is rude Ive driven out of my way a few times to the Wendys in Wilkinsburg just to avoid this placeAnyway I have no qualms with the food as its the same as any other Wendys So its fine if you have time to kill"

    "review":"This place is a hidden gem  I put this in the deli section but this is so much more than a deli local and organic foods daily specials salad and sandwich or soup and salad combos historic building where the preserved the original murals that are over 50 years oldMy friend suggested this place for lunch  and it was perfect  I really like to have a salad with a small sandwich and the salad sandwich combo was perfect  The small salad was just the right size  I had the Asian chicken salad and it was great  not at all over dressed and not too many friend noodlesI love that they have rehabed an old bakery that was local owned  The Red Oak has kept the original murals that were installed in the bakery over 50 years ago  They also serve smoothies and a breakfast menu I am very interested in trying an oatmeal smoothieI decided to go here for brunchlunch today with a couple of friends from the department at Pitt that I work for Today was probably the busiest I have ever seen Red Oak but it made me even more excited to try their food for the first time I ordered the Bacha ham egg and cheese sandwich on a butter croissant and a hot coffee although I really wanted to try the banana nutella pancakes The Bach was actually really good for being just a ham and cheese sandwich Their croissants as my friend told me are delicious and I would have been okay with ordering just that One of friends ordered a Carnegie with sausage and really enjoyed it Im excited to try other things here as everything is pretty fairly priced and the staff are friendly I probably wont come back during prime time for lunch though we went at 12 noon because its gets so crowdedIve eaten here a handful of times and there food is fresh and delicious  I would recommend the salmon avocado salad and chicken sriracha wrap  YummThis place has a great atmosphere and friendly workers My boyfriend and I walked in a few minutes before they closed but they didnt say a word until my boyfriend asked about it The guy at the register was very accommodating and friendly he told us they would still make whatever we ordered I got the Meatless Monday Blue Plate Special which had lentils potatoes and kale The food was decentnot anything fantastic but it was good My boyfriends MMM sandwich looked yummy as well and it came with his choice of a side This isnt the least expensive place on campus around seven or eight dollars but Id love to come back to try other menu itemsIve been here quite a bit since starting my job at Pitt I go every Friday and get the fish tacos They are so good It comes work 2 great sized tacos with rice corn and black beans There is a fresh slaw on top with Alvacado sauce They usually run out by 1pm so get there early Other than that Ive had the sweet potato and meat stew which was amazing and the salmon Alvacado salad which was really disgusting It might have just been my taste but the salmon tasted really awful and I eat salmon a lot The overall atmosphere is cozy and the workers are super nice Its a good spot for fresh healthy foodVery good fresh and healthy food Smokehouse turkey with side of hash was excellent  Have brunch juice bar and smoothies too"

    "review":"I adore Ephesus  Super underrated  Its a pizza place with a Turkish background so in addition to making some pretty decent pizza they serve traditional turkishmiddle eastern fare like kefta falafel baba hummus and its really goodTheir Adana Koeffte platter is to die for  And I just tried a new item yesterday called a pide peday its a turkish pizza shaped kinda like a football with a thinner different crust topped with ground spiced meat diced tomato spinach cheeses I lost my mind it was amazing  I am going back later this week to get another  maybe twoOh and they deliver  to half the city  I dont even have to leave my houseI had the Greek pizza with gyro meat and it was truthfully the best pizza that Ive had in a very long time I highly recommend stopping in and I will definitely be backIs sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible We place an order at 10:17 am for 2 extra large pizzas and 2 small The girl said about 45 min to an 1 hr great perfect timing in order to feed my staff at lunch when the girl repeated the phone number back I realized that this was the general number and asked if she could take my direct dial that way they would actually reach someone when the called to notify me that the delivery was in the lobby she repeated it back and I thought all was well I called back at 12:29 and asked if my order had left yet and all I was asked was what was the address ah hello were in downtown and did you ever think there might be more than one order coming in from the same office bldg A 3rd phone call was made closer to 1 pm to ask what was the hold up only to find out that my order was attempted to be delivered around 11:30 am but they couldnt reach anyone so they left when asked what number they were trying they said the general number yes the same number I advised the girl taking the order that she wouldnt reach anyone at The manager offered to remake the order since it had been sitting and offered a 5 discount on my next order wow thanks So after about 30 minutes the order still wasnt here so we called yet again only to be told were trying to call but no one is answering and that the driver was in the lobby Needless to say they had all the right numbers but not in the correct order Not only did we give them a direct dial at the beginning of the orderafter all the confusion and speaking with the manager we then gave a cell number just to be sure the call wouldnt be missed It seems the staff at Ephesus needs to take an effective listening class maybe itll help When we told them this was the worst service weve ever received and that we would not be ordering again the simple response was okThis is the best place IMO that delivers to Troy Hill  Please allow an hour at least for delivery  It is worth itIn the past Ive had the regular pizzas sausage pepperoni etc from there  Always delicious  Today I decided to try some of their other selections:Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum Pizza SOO GOODPide with Pastirma WONDERFULBeets I had a craving  Really really goodDelivery was only 5 minutes past the GrubHub estimate  Driver polite and friendly as has always been my experience with themIm usually stingy with the stars but as it is so hard to find good food delivered to Troy Hill not counting using Meals Delivered Im going for it  Five starsThree stars which i gave because their food is very good but the service is bad Should go but dont get angryJust moved to downtown Pittsburgh from NYC and this is the best delivery pizza Ive come across so far Prices are great and menu is really diverse too Definitely recommend"

    "review":"Formerly known as Eastern Chinese Buffet this establishment closed for a month or so during the summer of 14 and reopened as Panda Buffet I had always planned on going when it was Eastern Chinese Buffet but never made it as China Buffet King over in Green Tree always got my vote However the other night I was out and about with the full intention of trying it as the newly rechristened Panda BuffetIt was a pretty underwhelming experience I went between 7 and 8 PM and was the only person in there the majority of the time When I was nearly finished another person came in for some take out There is adequate room for a good number of diners in there but perhaps I just went during a less busy nightThe buffet is comprised of three main tables with a fourth one scuttled off to the side The first table had the standard fruit and dessert items Cakes cookies slices of watermelon you know the stuff The second and third tables had the various soups and Chinese dishes as well as the substandard American fare that plagues too many Chinese buffets The fourth table had a sad little tray of crab legs and a couple of other items that didnt look too appetizingIts a pretty rinkydink selection I tried the wonton soup first It was decent The wontons were small and the broth had decent flavor which is more than I can say for Phong May Houses wonton soup see the review for that place for those details I liked it enough to go back for a second bowl but that may have also been down to the slim selection on the buffet overallThe coconut shrimp was very good Nice and tangy with no fishy taste which is always a plus at a buffet I also enjoyed the steamed dumplings The filling seemed to be different from the usual potsticker recipe I couldnt tell if it was chicken pork or a mix of the two Weird stuff but another thing I had seconds ofThe General Tsos chickens sauce is way too thick It was similar to a thick barbecue sauce I didnt care for it Ditto on the egg rolls The pork filling in them was that strange sort of mincedspiced variety Way too overpowering I didnt try the spring rolls but they didnt look much betterA big problem overall was trying to determine how long all the food on the buffet had been out A person came out of the back and refilled the fried rice once Nothing else was refreshed or refilled the rest of the time I was there even though I had claimed the last of the dumplings and most of the wontons there were four before I got my soup The rest of the items had a sort of glazed over look to them especially the sweet and sour sauce which looked like it may have darkened and almost got a skin going on top Yeah Not so greatI doubt Ill ever go backIts definitely cheaper by a couple bucks than China Buffet King but the food isnt in the same class even though its buffet fare The two or three things I enjoyed were decent enough but nothing to get me to come back for those alone Maybe some people really dig this place but if my visit was any indication of a regular experience there I wouldnt be surprised if Panda Buffet winds up closing as wellStill have a lot to improve but decent food for the price The one buffet to go near this areaWowNot what it used to be Been here twice within last few months Very disappointed both times Because of se situation Most of the food selections are empty You ask them to bring some out Eventually they do only enough for one person I came here with three people We could not all enjoy the same dish because there was not enough A bit of false advertisingall you can eat buffetThere is nothing to eat Its a shame because it used to be a nice little place If you planned to stop for lunch and fill up a container to go Its not going to happenMSG MSG terrible crippling migraine from the extreme use of MSG Friendly service but that does not make up for my headache And waste of money ordering this"

    "review":"Boy do I miss Primate Bros  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 am  We were coming back from a night of being out n about with friends this was in high schoolcollege summers in the mid70s  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their Tshirtsbut alasleft it with a native friend she also liked it alot in Koh Samui ThailandDefinitely didnt live up to the expectations  Being from the east coast Ive had my fair share of delicious sandwiches  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich  Outside of the bread I cant say it was memorable in any wayThat said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot moreThe restaurant did their level best to make it up to me so heres another star for giving a damn ThanksIf youve been to Pittsburgh you know what to expect from a Primanti Sandwich When Im in the mood for them they are fantastic So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants and this one came up They thought it sounded fun and different but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side and the other is gluten intolerant I really didnt think Primanti would be the best place to take themWalking around down town we passed this one and they wanted to sit down and give it a try It was a beautiful day so we sat outside which was really amazing We were also amazed by our server By the end of the meal we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all In fact its a distinct possiblility that she didnt ever work there and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square You dont go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to and she was far off that markShe took forever to get there but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals We talked about the menu Auntie decided to order anything with no bread with some loaded fries Mom wanted a sardine sandwich but only if its the sardine filets she doesnt like the kind with bones She is not one to make a fuss so figured cheese and egg would be fine too When she came around for drinks they got a water and a pop I asked if she had PBR and she replied she didnt know Then continued to stand there pen in hand ready to write my drink order down OK then how about I just have a diet pop Before she ran off we ordered our meals I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said insert foul insult here and shrugged A big slow deliberate shrug Not a word And then just stood there waiting to write my order down After a good long awkward pause she said I dont know  All three of us just looked back at her waiting until eventually she sighed held her pad down by her side and with a big roll of the eyes asked if I wanted her to check Yes Please doSo then she ran off and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks Running the sandwiches she would grab two or three tables at a time and then put all the sandwiches down sort of paw through them to see what was what and leave theirs and take the rest It was just strangeShe came back and without looking up announced Dont matter we are out of sardines anywaysFacepalm From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant I doubt she even asked Mom very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience asked for egg and cheese Auntie ordered loaded fries to start then her corned beef with no bread The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich but she wanted them anyways I got balogna just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo meansOf course the order came out quickly and wrong Mine was fine the way it came but not what I asked for Mom was the same Auntie was fine but no loaded fries every showed up Until we got the check thats where they were Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server My Aunt picked up lunch and left the tip I dont know what she left but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us All in all I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we didThere was a lot of hype leading up to a visit to Primanti BrosI was very excited and wanted badly to love it  The place was packed but the service was friendly and on top of it the whole time we were there despite having a group of sevenThe Pittsburgher: fries coleslaw cheese steak all on a single sandwich  I expected a taste explosion in my mouth but somehow everything just seemed to cancel everything out  The Cheesesteak was just a burger  The fries were mushy and undefined  The only thing I could kind of taste was the slaw and it was not my favorite  Im saddened to say I left half my sandwich completely untouched on the table when I leftI had a cheeseburger and it was decent Im not a fan of coleslaw which made the burger a little dry after taking it off Ill have to give something else a try the next time I am in town"

    "review":"I havent been to a Hard Rock since I was 14 or 15 back in the days when it was SUPER cool to sport your Hard Rock Orlando tshirt much to the envy of your bananaclip clad friends I was tasked over Thanksgiving with finding a joint that we consider to be momfriendly since my Mom isnt really a foie gras and fondant kind of lady I actually hate foie gras too but you get the idea I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was at the Hard Rock Cafe at Station Square Can you believe it The fries were great and the music wasnt too loud This is the best decision when you dont want to go to one of the 7 sports bars the area offers to unhappily wedge yourself in a sea of beersoaked Steelers jerseys Big up to the Hard Rock I almost bought a tshirt just for the camp factorFood was good  but service bad A customer shouldnt have to ask for silverware or water after theyve already received their meal and had nothing to eat with Servers need to pay attention to detailMy friends and I had lunch after the duck tour The honey mustard chicken sandwich was very good Burgers and chicken fingers were also very good Mac and cheese sounded good but was disappointing The cheese sauce was not thick enough and not cheesy enough I had the best mojotio at the Aruba Hard Rock Cafe on vacation I was so looking forward to this drink and it was just ok We sat outside and it was a beautiful view of the city Service was goodIts a hard rock We went for an early dinner on a Friday There was no wait for a table and we were seated promptly The waitress was efficient and not overly friendly The food came very quickly and was served hot and fresh The only true gripe I have is that hard rocks in general are over priced The food is the same at all of the chain restaurants I would prefer to hit up an Applebees and save a few bucksIf you enjoy other Hard Rock cafes you will have a very similar experience here The food is typical nothing spectacular but nothing bad too  the service is fast and polite while the outside patio is extremely nice when the weather is good  It faces right at the fountain and the river and it is really really nice  The music is nice at least for whoever likes rock apparently : and there was nothing really bad associated with my experience thereI came here yesterday and had a great hot dog meal Today at first I went to Houlihans looked at their terrible design and small menu and decided to come back This is just the introduction Nothing much intended hereWe were seated immediately No wait at all We were seated in the back of the restaurant in which it was a little cool but aside from that the records and album covers and fancy electric guitars were really cool Of course to every good thing a bad The walls were bricks and Im sorry but I just dont like bricksThen we hit a slope At first our waitress was really nice and didnt take any time at all to take our drinks and orders Then we didnt see her for 10 minutes at least She walked around us and near us but never to our table Slopes  1 stars and thats why I had it at three stars at this timeThe food of course was great again but it just wasnt the kind of wait we wanted Im looking for better restaurants Station Square is cool Hard Rock is cool our waitress was NOT cool Go to the Melting Pot"

    "review":"This particular location has the best service of any Pittsburgh locations The staff is always willing to accommodate anything you ask for The Joey with tofu is a phenomenal burrito and their salsa is addictiveGREAT Service  Everything is fresh and you get nice size meals Prices are not bad either My friends  I were full when it was time to goBut Ill be BACK You cant go wrong with Moes  The service is always polite and prompt  The ingredients always taste fresh and for the money you do get a generous amount of fillings  In my opinion its better than the other burrito chains in PittsburghGo for the burritos stay for the salsa barI will be giving this place 5 stars for the food and the service as everything within the restaurants control was perfect  The food was perfect  portions were plentiful and very tasty   They had that Coke machine where you customize your drink which I also thought was neat  The problem was that a basketball team with young kids was in there having a party of some sorts  The restaurants walls didnt help suppress the noise and it was very loud in there  But this group got to be more and more out of control that had I been the manager I wouldve told them to cut it out  McDonalds is down the road  I can safely assume that the manager wouldve gotten in trouble by his higherups had he done such a thing  I love Moes and will come back but I wish places would have a policy on controlling groups of kids  Plus McDonalds is right up the roadSolid food Lunch crew better than night Night shorts you on chips Didnt even have enough to finish the quesoWelcome to Moes A place where you get exactly what you expect and deserve: quick service and tasty food at a reasonable price As a bonus there are plenty of addon toppings to choose from and when you order to go they load you up with an indigestible quantity of tortilla chips The salsa bar is another strong point where you can get as much as you like of eight dips  some regulars and others that rotate this week I enjoyed the cucumber pineapple salsa"

    "review":"For value and taste Taste of Art gives you bang for your buck Students welcome you provide service and prepare the food in professional grade kitchens The atmosphere is also lovely energetic yet relaxing Ive attended the end of quarter buffet 3 times this far and enjoy it every time This little restaurant offers  worldly cuisine for very affordable pricesI started off with the shiitake french onion soup followed by a fine pinapple caprese appatiser My entr was a steak sandwich on brioche served with a small potato salad and pico de gallo Finally ending with homemade apple pie and vinella bean icecreamYes the food was great but the service was abysmal Took a long time for the food to arrive and they took around 30 min to figure out what the bill wasBut i give them credit for the good food the presentation the taste and the location The staff were friendlyI will definitely go there when i have over 15 hours to kill for lunch That was my only downside45  a bit taken off for reasons belowFirst off some of the dishes are beautifully plated and visual appeal always makes a differenceOn Tuesday I ordered the steak diane which came with roasted beets and potato croquettes The roasted beets were just regular diced beets  juicy and sweet The potato croquettes came way too crispy as theyd fried it for too long but after mentioning this to the server he brought me another order that tasted absolutely wonderful  soft warm and full of potato goodness The steak was either rare or medium rare  I didnt specify  and very flavorful and tender It doesnt seem to be seasoned which is perfect for me as I prefer to taste the foods themselvesOn Wednesday I ordered the salted caramel whiakey tart Best salted caramel sauce Ive ever had Most just taste like regular caramel The salt flavor in this however shone through without overpowering the sweetness The dark chocolate on the tart was perfect The tart did come too hard to cut due to the layer of salted caramel though and all of their available ones were still frozen so I had to lift and bite in an uncouth manner they had no other unfrozen ones It was very chewy Aside from the difficulty though it tasted great with the spicy whiskey flavor well I guess alcohol in general although Im not 21 yet mixed with the sweet elementsThe minor mistakes were understandable since the chefs are simply students and theyre quite skilled in any case Servers are also wonderfully cordialIf this week werent the only one that I had time available came on spring break because I have classes at this time otherwise Id definitely come more often They also have a weekly specials menu in addition to the regular semester menu with all sorts of novel dishesGood food prepared by the students for class  Open for lunch only  The students learn how to handle the restaurant and all the issues  Only open for a few weeks each term and only on Monday thru Wednesday not sure of how many weeks it is open each term  Food was very good and students wait on you as well  Should call and make reservations and can BYOB if you wish  Have Greek theme this term on daily specials Wait staff was a little nervous and needed some training but very attentive and helpful  Give it a try if you have little time in and out in less than 1 hour  The soups and deserts are very good tooToA is open again  Stopped in for lunch  They have a nice varied menu  There does not seem to be a theme this term  Had a really nice meal with a friend  The menu includes soups and appetizers salads entrees and deserts  The desert was delicious so save room"

    "review":"Go to a restaurant where youre taken care of and not where youre doing all the running aroundThe only reason for 3 stars instead of 15 is because the food is quite good especially the Bahn Mi from Provisions and the burger is outstanding  Other than that their system is just ridiculous and confusing You need to pay at each restaurant and theres no freeflow or continuity within the group of restaurants like where you pay at the end for all sorts and varieties offered  In other word its too much work and Hey if I wanted to work and do all the running Id stay home and cook my own mealYour wallet is out all the timeSince you have to pay at each restaurant its just a bad business model  The whole point is to enjoy something from each place With your wallet constantly out it just doesnt work You tend to stick to 1 place and so the other standsrestaurants get the shaft And this is if youre staying IN to eat  I could understand this for takeout But otherwise its ridiculous  I cant see this lasting long The menus are hard to read you dont have time to figure things out if its crowded you better know what you want and you see most people squinting and trying to make it out and keep an eye on how many people youre give your cc to Total disappointment If they need to explain how to get a meal DOESNT WORK Its stupidAddress is actually 2016 small man streetReally fun cool concept where you can pick from 4 restaurants order at the counter then give them your cell and you are texted when your order is ready Nicer atmosphere than I expected cafeteria style seating with bar located near seatingVeggie perspective  definetly have a few options among the 4 restaurants carota cafe had the most options so I went there for entree AND dessert Carota cafe review: chef Jessica Lewis I loved the kale and egg great flavored fresh and though it doesnt look like a lot of food it filled me up dish Yucca fries were mediocre perhaps Im not used to yucca but very dry and chewy the aioli was great tho Lastly I finished the true chocolate babka which was perfect and not too sweet  They gave me a small glass of the beet mulled wine which was delicious and on the house This was a limited opening  looking forward to more visits to the galleyTheNice food Idiotic concept You feel like youre walking around inside a website Confusing Line up and spend 6 dollars here do it all again 3 feet away have your privacy invaded and your data mined get 4 texts and two robot calls all to gather up your own lunch and sit at a picnic table Guess what Googleeyed hipsters there are chefs out there who will wow you and treat you like a guest in their homes Support them Love innovation but the Burgh is all about keeping it real and this place is the polar oppositeThis is a great concept  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the chefs in the test kitchen are great  They will talk with you if they have time about their style and food which add a lot to the experience  The dishes are not all home runs but that is why the test kitchen exists to allow the chefs to get feedback and try out some of their ideas before they open up an independent restaurant The bar and coffee baristas are great as well The one big critique that I have is the lay out  The restaurant feels crowded all the time because of the use of space  They tried to put large tables in a place that is not necessarily made for them creating a cramped environment  So when the Galley does get busy then there is little room to move  Overall I love this concept and the food here at this restaurant  My hats off to the chefs that are starting out here  I hope that Pittsburgh is able to open more places like this that will attract young chefs to the growing food sceneSuch a great addition to the Strip District Ive gone here multiple times now for brunch dinner and just drinks and always have been impressed Ive tried food from all four of the kitchens and can honestly say Id go back to any of them Some favorites have been the roasted beets at Provision the octopus at Carota the corned beef sandwich from Aubergine and of course the avocado toast from Josephines The menus seem to frequently change or have specials and thats one of the great things about this place I plan to keep going back and wont get tired of the options While all of the food choices are good the bar might even be better They have a changing menu of local beers on tap and the cocktails are delicious And if you get there for happy hour pricing you cant ask for much more Theres also an espresso bar area if you arent in the mood for alcoholic beverages The only negative I have is that when the bar area gets crowded its not the most convenient for this type of setup where you have to order your own drinks every time and there are not servers but overall the pros of SG outweigh the cons by a lot Check it out if you get the chanceJust made it to Smallman Galley this week with a friend and it definitely lived up to the hype I love the concept of the chef incubator and the space is such a great addition to the Strip District It was early enough to grab a seat at the bar for happy hour which by the way is awesome Half off all drinks and wine from 57 pm I was thrilled to find a happy hour that extends past 6:00 I started with the Strictly Business cocktail and it was wonderful  a mix of Boyd  Blair cinnamon and ginger beer The perfect winter cocktail I also love how each chef also has a hand in the cocktail selections for the menu Now onto the food We started with the mushroom and brie toast from Josephines Toast and it was excellent The perfect amount of melted brie and various mushrooms Then we shared both the beef and pork meatballs and the fresh pasta from Aubergine Both were phenomenal The pasta had root vegetables tossed with pesto and parmesan And the meatballs were served over mashed potatoes which we loved Currently I can only speak to Josephines and Aubergine in regards to food but I certainly will be back to try others Once again another solid addition to our food scene here in Pittsburgh Smallman Galley is worth the hype  get there"

    "review":"This place was quite good My husband and I were running errands nearby and wanted to grab a quick tasty lunch I found this place on yelp and it led us to a very delicious lunch The smells coming out of the back of the place definitely lured us in Its a small cozy place on the inside nothing too fancy But the service is fast and pleasant I got the banaganoush and stuffed meat grape leaves and my husband got the meat shawarma platter Our food came out pretty quickly which was good since we were hungry The stuffed grape leaves melted in my mouth yum so delicious If Im passing through that area I would definitely make another trip here for lunchSmall and appears to be family owned Fair prices with generally very good food and generous portionsThe moussaka was a treat as were the hummus baba and sleek This is BYOBI did not however care for the house salad dressing I was expecting an olive oillemon based dressing but this was creamy and didnt appeal to me However to be objective about it mayo is one of only my few food dislikes so I am biasedAllinall though this was very good and a nice change from AladdinsExcellent foodSmall restaurant   Excellent food with good portions  Love the filet kabobs dinnerTheir hummus is extremely creamy and smooth   Wonderful by itself or with the filet on top  The lentils and rice dish is also delicious  Their meat grape leaves are our favorite in Pittsburgh This is a family owned business and the family takes care of you  Wonderful service   Dont forget the baklava DeliciousIt is easy for takeout too  They are closed MondaysThe food here is delicious I had a sampler appetizer and everything we very tasty The lamb kabob sandwich was particularly good Too many times places over cook the lamb and it ends up dry but my lamb was cooked perfectly I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the interior could definitely use a renovationThe food is amazing We ordered grape leaves baba ghannouj gyros falafel kibbee The service was great and the food came out really fast Will definitely be returningThe food here is hands down delicious If youre looking for something tasty to try check out the spinach and feta pie The baked kibbee is to die for and the lamb sandwich is always on point Its never over cooked or chewy I typically order mine without the hummus but add a white garlic sauce to it The babaghanoush is sooooo good Pretty much anything on the menu here is wonderful and cooked perfectly and with passion Dont skip out on the lentil soup either"

    "review":"This place was recommend by the hotel I was staying at  It was the worst prime rib Ive ever had  There was fat running throughout the piece of meat that was practically impervious to my knife which actually wasnt a good steak knife at all  It extremely hard to chewThe service was only sosoThe one hight point of the evening: the chocolate pudding creme bruleeWe complained to the hotel shuttle driver on the way home and apparently this place is hit or miss and it depends on whos in the kitchen  Thats just no good at allAs you can see by the overall rating on this restaurant you should avoid I have been twice the first time was much better than the first The first time I went with a party of 7 and we sat at a round table had apps dinner and drinks and everything was fine and service was good The second time I made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of time since it was a large party after my graduation my family came from out of town about 20 people When we got there they told us we would be at two separate tables even though when I made the reservation they said that we would all be seated together Not only were we separated but instead of connecting two long rectangular tables they had about 15 of us at a long table and my mom and grandma and 3 others at a circular table across the room I was pretty mad about that had I known it wouldve been like that I never would have went Anyway the food and service was also awful We had to flag servers down and NO ONE OF THE TWENTY PEOPLE were impressed with their food In fact my dad had to buy food right after we left because he didnt eat anything The whole experience was really disappointing especially when youre paying so much for bad food and service Never ever again Listen to the reviews and go elsewhereOld school yes  Good food and fast service yes  Would I go back  Depends  I went here after googling steak houses in Pittsburgh and this place came up and it is located only a few miles from our hotel  It was almost empty although it was around 9pm and the beginning of spring break at Pitt so easily explainable  The waitress was freindly but not a great waitress in that she really didnt refill the drinks until we asked her to and she kind of seemed like she was tired worn out etc  I decided on the orange roughy with a side caesar salad and the cheddar smashed potatoes  The fish came in a cream sauce which I did not want so I asked them to season the fish in a way that the sauce wont be missed  They definitelty listened to me bc the roughy turned out pretty good and the salad was a nice size for a starter salad  The cheddar potatoes were what made the meal  They were fantastic and I wish more places would start offering this as a side choice  The only complaint is that the portion of the potatoes was a little on the small side however they were really good and I didnt leave hungry which is always a plus  This place was a nice beginning to my stay in Pittsburgh and the best meal that I had while I was in townFirst and last time there  The bus boy dropped the rag on the floor picked it up and immediately wiped a table down with this now dirty rag  My husband ordered another drink he never got it  Our sides were luke warm at best  Bread was stale and the entre ordered Salmon Majestic was suppose to have crab meat and artichoke hearts on it which is the reason ordered There were no artichoke hearts on it When I brought this to our waiters attention he said he would see if he can dig some up  When I inquired about it 1015 minutes later he said they thought they were on it and wouldnt bring any more  Although price wasnt adjusted   When I advised about the drink not being served he said nothing although offered to bring another serving of rice even though we were done with dinner  When he brought the check he said I couldnt do anything about the dinner but I took off the winewhich wasnt the drink that was ordered it was a chevez off the check  HorribleFood is consistently good  Service is friendly and good also  Best zucchini app in town  Love to sit at the bar  The bartender JC always makes it entertainingIve been coming here since I was a kid for 20 years now  Went for my one year wedding anniversary and was disappointed  The service and food were ok but for the price I could have had 5 times as much food anywhere else  The seats are uncomfortable and shift its dark and dreary inside"

    "review":"Love the ambience and cocktails and always enjoy interacting with the staff I go there every few weeks to enjoy fresh cocktails with friends Ive also experienced the bartenders making unique specialty drinks that arent on the menu when I ask them for something special Specialty cocktails take a while to drink but this is a place you come to in order to relax and sip something delicious If you wanna get wasted on shots as soon as you walk into a place this might be the wrong place for you The food is also deliciousI have loved this place ever since it opened Ive never had a bad drink here and I find it fascinating to watch the incredibly hipster staff make them with so much attention to detail I love the way they serve you a glass of bubbly when you first get inI also really enjoy the food  you should definitely consider ordering snacks to go with your cocktails They rotate the menu so its hard to keep up but everything has been deliciousWhat keeps me from giving it 5 stars The prices The price of even standard drinks eg a gin and tonic is a little high for my liking I would come here all the time if it were just a tad less expensive I still come here at least once a month because I just cant resistFantastic cocktails  We went early for a cocktail before dinner  I had a standard oldfashioned to see how their housemade bitters are  Excellent My wife also liked her  drinkWe were waited on immediately and our drinks were served in under 5 minutes Our bartender was very friendly and cool  Awesome RecommendedThis is a cool cocktail bar Its a good place to go and ask for something offmenu but they have many excellent suggestions as well There isnt really food here Three or so good beers available but this is a cocktail placeKinda loudcould use some sound bafflingbut a comfortable location in a fun neighborhoodLoved the interior decor and the service  When you arrive the waiter gives you water and a little cup of sparkling rose What a lovely touch  Made us feel very welcome and was a great palette cleanser  The cocktails were yummy and our waiter helped us decide by having us answer a series of questions which was fun Looking forward to returningI love classic cocktails This place has some of the best My wife and I dont get the opportunity to go out very often but when we do this is one of the places that will be on our list It can get a little busy but its always worth the wait"

    "review":"This is a great Pizza Hut location  On our first couple nights in Pittsburgh my husband and I ordered from here online  They delivered it to our hotelthe pizza was hot and delicious compared to most Pizza Hut locations the delivery was quick and the drivers were friendlyNow Im sure there are better local pizza joints around but we needed dinner and we needed it deliveredPittsburgh streets are scary  I would recommend this place to anyone in a similar situation or Pizza Hut lovers near ShadysideCan a pizza have too much toppings Holy bejesus these guys really piled it on my pie yesterday The current carryout 10 any pizza 2 for extra cheese or stuffed crust I found out is a great bargainI have to admit the pepperoni lovers with Italian sausage and mushrooms pan pizza is too rich for me I actually like bites of just cheese sauce and crust when I eat pizza I am a big fan of the Papa Johns down the street with the garlic dipping sauce but if I am really hungry this Pizza Hut is the dealI ordered online by web because their iPad app didnt have the carryout deal or any other deals click on deals and you get some message about everyday low pricing and no coupons needed fail It was piping hot when I got there to pick up 15 minutes later Great counter serviceConvenient parking lot behind the store Carryout or delivery only No seatingLove the food but this branch is a mess I ordered a big box which included pizza breadsticks and cinnamon sticks That didnt meet the price requirement for delivery so I ordered a 2 oz soda to put me over the limit I never got the soda and the pizza box was soaked in wing sauce I didnt even order wings It got all over my clothes and hands and I had to scrub the counters after setting the box down It was handed to me like that Couldnt believe itThis pizza hut is very hit and miss but mostly missThe main problem is not enough sauce  In order to combat this I even ordered extra sauce but there was still barely any on the pizzaThey are generally good about giving a lot of crust flavor but sauce and cheese game is too weak  Better off at Little CsLet me say first that when you call the number for Pizza Hut and expect to talk to the actual store to place your order think again  What happens even though the number is a local number you are redirected to a call center  Yes a call center its not bad enough that telemarketers use a call center but why do I need a call center to order a pizza from a shop up the road  To make matters worse if your address does not show up for them they will put you on hold and then attempt to transfer you to the store  What happened to me was that each time they transferred me which was three times I was hung up on  Each time  Then they acted like it was my fault this was happening one time when I called back and was explaining my situation the gentleman on the other end interrupted me and said if I wouldnt cooperate he would end the call  If you want my business you will make this work not threaten me  It is not my fault that I want to talk to someone in this store to place my order and not talk to a third party placing my order  What is so difficult about making this happen  Once again why do we need a call center for a Pizza Hut orderWhen I finally did get to talk to the girl at this location it was like I was inconveniencing her Placed my order and waited  The only good thing about this experience was that after twenty minutes on the phone placing the order the order actually showed up earlier than what they quoted me  However the food was cold by the time it was delivered and the pizza was kind of put together lopsidedAnother thing they do not list on their site or tell you over the phone is that there is a 3 delivery fee  Lesson learned here you want good fresh food order from a local shop and not a national chainNote: this is a deliverypick up only location no dine in available here"

    "review":"Ive never had a bad meal at August Henrys and since its a half a block from my office Ive gotten to sample many things from the menu  Im never left feeling hungry either  The portions are enormous AND delicious  The fish sandwich is bigger than your head  The Stromboli is one of the best around  And the menu is varied enough that every one of your picky annoying friends andor coworkers will be satisfied  The items appear pricey on the menu but once you get your food and find yourself struggling to finish the last bite the 9 bucks you spent on a sandwich is well worth it  The atmoshere is chill and relaxing  A great place to have lunchAugust Henrys has a lot of potential  the location could be a prime spot for pretheater diners for posttheater drinks for weekend lunch while out and about downtown  But the service makes it pretty awfulI was staying at the Courtyard across the street on a recent visit to Pittsburgh and my brother and I ventured over to August Henrys to grab a drink and a snack as we prepared to do some barhappy hour hopping  It was about 3 pm on a Saturday  We walked in and sat at the bar  There were 2 other people at the bar both drinking beers  After we sat down someone who I assumed was the bartender came over and asked if we wanted some waters while we waited  Um sure  I was a little confused as I was unsure exactly what I was waiting for  I assumed a menu  After about 15 minutes of not another single person even looking in our direction or speaking a word to us we left  Im still not entirely sure what I was supposed to be waiting for  Some communication would have helped  I would have considered giving it another try on Sunday during the football game but they werent open  I would possibly give it another try next time Im back in town  but only if I cant find a better option  Sorry August Henrys  Im still wondering what we were waiting forAverage food at best that is extremely over priced This was my first and last time hereIm hoping we went on an off day My husband and I popped in yesterday right before we were heading to the airport to go home The burgers were blah and we were definitely bothering the bartender The profanity and gossiping that was going on between the waitstaff was nauseating If I finally waved her down for our check Maybe the burgers wouldve tasted better if the bar was more invitingWell I must say that words fail me If there is a worse place in Pittsburghs downtown to eat particularly at this price point I cannot imagine it Service was impossibly slow the food nothing more than commercially prepared fare warmed or regrilled on the premises and even that wasnt done very well The wait staff was uninterested in their customers and unkempt to the point of being dirty: and this from a Williamsburg Brooklynite who knows nasty when he sees it The menu tries to be everything to everybody and as a result the restaurant produces an incredibly poor product My biggest mistake was eating what was served instead of leaving Dont make this mistakeCame 2pm on a Monday which was pretty ideal since no one else was in the entire restaurant The service at the bar was great even gave me wet naps she must have known how messy I am The turkey burger was huge and delicious and they let you choose any two toppings  I went with the jalapeos and white cheddar bomb Perfect amount of food too The coleslaw tasted fresh Very tasty overall good affordable place to stop downtown"

    "review":"Dont know why ppl disappointed by thierr rice dishes I had pork chop bento and shaved ice  today and it was authentic I stopped in for some bubble tea around noon on the weekend The restaurant itself was pretty empty so there wasnt much of a wait I ordered the Bubble Milk Mountain Tea small is 375 with tax The bubbles were a little on the hard side but the tea itself was sweetened just enough which allowed the flavor of the tea to come through Definitely a nice refreshing treat for a summer dayI went here for my first time today and had the best ice bubble coffee Ive ever had in my life Service was also fast and friendly Cant wait to go backAvoid this place 3 dollars for 4 small meat balls You can buy much more in Asian grocery stores with much better quality The meat sucks It was not even fresh kind of gross To sum up high price with low quality avoid this placeThis is a really good little hot pot place for Pittsburgh The premium beef slices were a little too small but still pretty good quality I prefer just the regular beef its sliced better and the taste is still pretty good The hot pot comes with a great amount of veggies and noodles I really like the herbal soup The service was excellent and the servers were really niceIm so glad I found this place near my house and cant wait to go backPretty good After reading the negative reviews I was pleasantly surprised by this place I ordered the salt and pepper chicken it came out quickly looked great and tasted great as well The service was great the waitress was really attentive without being overly present or obnoxious I loved that there was a good portion of veggies with the dish definitely gave it a good combination of flavor Will come back to try the macchiato bubble tea have only seen this so far in China so Im excited to see how it is here"

    "review":"I tried this makeover and found it very pleasant One night I believe a Wednesday they had a nice jazz ensemble The wine that I had both times  a white Pinot was very good I ate at the bar and liked the food The service was friendly which is always my number one need in any restaurant andor barWe first found Culture in February Wife and i were downtown for a show and had some time before it started so we decided to stop and get a drink We tried to go to Proper brick oven but the place was an overcrowded madhouse so we left We saw Culture across the street and it didnt look too crowded so we went there We sat at the bar and had a drink The atmosphere was easy going and the staff very friendly We decided to come back for dinner some night   Fast forward to April we are in town for another show and decided to go to Culture We got there later than we wanted due to silly traffic issues from the damn Pirates game    We were seated immediately and served promptly Our server was very busy as the patio was open outside and she was covering it also We both ordered a salad mine with chicken and my wife with salmon The portion of salmon on her salad was very generous and was done perfectly She raved My chicken was also done perfectly and was very tasty My wife had a cosmo and it was very good    The people at Culture are a big part of what makes the difference IMO We were able to make our show on time and after the show i suggested we stop back at Culture for a cocktail while the traffic cleared We were in the plaza close to their patio when the gentleman from Culture who we had talked to at dinner saw us He came over to us invited us to sit at a table and relax and offered to bring us drinks himself I am not sure if he was a manager owner part owner or what bit he was an awesome guy and made us feel both welcome and important    We enjoyed a drink and ordered a chicken quesadilla which we shared and it was fantastic The staff was super friendly and the whole atmosphere was friendly and upbeat    Culture has only been open a short time They are still fine tuning their business The prices are competitive for the cultural district Their drinks are actually a little less expensive than Olive or Twist I think they may have been a little short staffed but the staff that was there was exemplary  We will be backThis used to be the Grille on Seventh Well start with The menu The menu is limited but looks good A little more expensive than it should be 17 hamburger 18 salmon salad But they have great outdoor seating in the Katz park across the street from the Benedum Our time was limited and we let our waiter know so we ordered what appeared to be easy ravioli two salads and an iced tea We were one of perhaps 3 tables  This is where the story changes We cant review the food as we didnt get it Our time ran out As with most patrons in the Cultural Distrct we had show tickets We went inside for the third time asking about our food Again they said it was coming I presume they were waiting for the tea to steep as well We explained we had to leave A nice woman came out and took my name She apologized and said she would take care of us upon our return We dont know when or if that will happen Not feeling much confidence They werent busy then not sure what another visit will revealWe came here before seeing a show at the Benedum Center There were 7 of us When we first arrived 2 of us ordered Miller Lite The waitress came back with one bottle of Miller Lite stating it was their last bottle When it came time to order we discovered that we had three different menus with different prices on each When we asked about it the waitress informed us that we would be charged the least amount for anything that had a different price on different menusAll of us ordered an entree and either a soup or salad to go with it After a very long time the waitress brought our entrees but no soup or salads We told her that we hadnt received our soup and salads She replied that she would bring them right away When we all had finished our meals she arrived with a tray full of spring vegetable soups This is not what any of us had ordered They had run out of spring mix for the salads so she couldnt bring those and they had also run out of the turkey chili that the rest of us had ordered The soup had chicken in it and the two that had ordered the salads were vegetarians so they could not eat it as a replacement We were not even asked if we wanted a replacement just given this soup instead which the one of us who accepted it as a replacement ate with a forkThe food was mediocre at best and the service was just terribleWe have season tickets to the Benedum Center and I can assure you we will be finding a different restaurant to have dinner before our next showIve been craving Chicken Parmesan for a while and they delivered Very hospitable service and I actually got to meet the Chef Claude Pierre Well definitely be backCame here this past Saturday for dinner at around 5pm It wasnt crowded and my party of 4 were seated immediately We came because its a black owned business  we wanted to check it out The menu wasnt extensive but it had lots of good sounding things They dont have a physical drink menu but of course made everything we asked for  all of us loved of our drinks I had a guava mojito  it was amazing I ordered the Jack Daniels wings which came with fries  it was delicious It comes with 6 wings flats and legs  I could only eat 4 I think the fries were hand cut they were great too The owner came to talk to us which showed great hospitality There was a great live DJ and they have a chalk board of all the events going on The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because our food took a little longer than we anticipated we were the only ones not seated at the bar and we wished there a little more on the menu to pick from However the owner told us they just opened in January so we figured theyre still getting their footing in the industry But I will definitely be back"

    "review":"went there for lunch and i had the skirt steak hoagie that came with soup and coleslaw for under 6 bucks my wife got the fried haddock sandwich which was enough for 3  food was 5 star peppersteak soup was very good  and there is plenty oof parking across the st in a city lot attached bar too that we didnt go to try it out its worth itIm sorry but I definitely do not like this place  I absolutely hated the decor I felt like I was in a 70s style Golden Corral The extra room with live music was just not my kind of place and the bar was super crowded with bartenders who werent particularly nice or efficient I cant speak for the food which others here have said is average I will not come here for brunch and I would only go here again if I was in a group who insisted They are many better places in Lawrenceville to spend your moneyHambones is a great bar with great bar food  Jeff the owner is there often  friendly as hands on as an owner should be  The hambones stew is the famous thing to get  Burgers and apps are good  The Thursday night comedy show has some good performers  Like that comedian with the beard and the hairDecent local hang out They usually have a string band playing in the back room when we go on SundaysThere are 34 pinball machines there all the time so its fun to go with some friends The food is good bar food My favorites are buffalo chicken dip and the Krusty burger101015  bring back the Krusty BurgerI love coming here on Tuesday for 150 tacos they are so good Appetizers are half price during happy hourIve had the burger it was on point I also had their seafood chowder which my boyfriend was questionable about but it was amazing I would rather eat seafood chowder here than wholeys Hambone stew is also really goodI really dig Hambones for several reasons One its a really relaxed vibe Its not fancy its rundown and chill My friends come here for gaming so you might be able to see why we like the place so much Drinks and food here are really cheap and they have a small but nice collection of pinball tables in the back The Elvira table is pretty amazing and its pleasure to be able to play such a vintage table The drinks here are no fuss and to the point I liked what I had and theres not more to say on thatThe appetizers are horribly greasy but its so good Fried broccoli with cheddar provolone sticks onion rings yum Eventually I learned that theres a restaurant portion next door When I went to this side it was really awkward Our server was either new or just socially awkward He barely spoke but he did his job and we werent feeling social anyway I like their menu Im a vegetarian and theres more than one option so thats always good in my book I had a southwest wrap and my boyfriend had a grilled cheese We swapped half of each so we could enjoy the flavors When they something will be spicy it will be spicy I was impressed Ill probably be back to Hambones a lot in the future The food is cheaper than other places its cozy in there and its perfect for a board game session or pinball What more could a girl want"

    "review":"Try the knots on the appetizer menu and the wings  Weve been back several times since their recent opening and have yet to had something we didnt love  Wedgie is huge hoagies are good fries are good pizza crust is awesome  Definitely worth a try  You can also order and eat at the Milestone next doorAnytime I get a new menu in the mail I have to give it a try They had a coupon for pizza and a whole hoagie so I gave that a shot I ordered the pizza with green peppers onions and mushrooms Pizza was fantastic crispy yet chewy crust My only complaint would be I wish there was a little more sauce but other than that a fantastic pie As for the hoagie I ordered the Texas Roadhouse steak and it was unbelievable The steak was tender and flavorful and I love a nice soft bun The onion rings and Santa Fe sauce was a very nice combinationAnother time ordering I got the gyro platter and I was very disappointed Frozen presliced gyro meat and a very bland sauce I also asked for feta cheese which they did not put on Overall I will be ordering from here more often trying more of the menu But as of now its one of the better if not the best pizza place on CarrickThere are a lot of pizza places that deliver in this area but I have gotten disappointed so often this year that I was beginning to suspect I just dont like pizza anymore Is that even a thing that can happen I realized its not me its them I mean if after an evening of libations and whatnot if we dont care for your cheesy baked and fried foods delivered no less then maybe your food just sucksWe were in Milestones one night and the bar maid sincerely vouched for this place She said theyre different I grudgingly went over  grabbed a menu but expected littleTHEY ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GOODNot just drunk Ive been laid up at home for a month or so  ordered from here once or  twice a weekI recommend the Pepperoni Twist Rolls their regular pizzas and the DiRomas Greek pizza the wings better than 51 Wings or any of the bars  meaty juicy crispy and wellsauced and their salads are way better than pizza shops usually do Hoagies are ok  Im not a big sandwich fanThey use quality toppings slice their veggies just right and balance all the ingredients very well My friend thought the twist rolls could use more meat  cheese once and I think the pierogie pizza would have benefited from more sauce  sauteed onions Their pizza crust is not amazing but perfectly fine and holds up if you reheat it the next dayDelivery times are reasonable and the employees are all very courteousHighly recommendI called to place my order and asked what the specials were The person on the other line chuckled and said Specials Whats that So I just ordered my default order: a pizza and bread sticks They were really quick with my order My husband who picked up the order said that the setup was pretty cool as its connected to a bar Oh and they accept cardsI was excited that they offered a large selection of toppings but they were pretty expensive For my large pizza it was an extra 5 for 2  toppings that arent even considered premium The food itself was disappointing The container of marinara that came with the breadsticks was cold and way too sweet The breadsticks were bland They tasted like bread with no garlic flavor and minimal cheese flavor Even so I would rather eat the breadsticks without that awful sauce The pizza tasted as if it was made with the same overly sweet sauce that came with the breadsticks making it unpalatableIn short with so many other pizza options in the area I wont be coming back hereI love that they have wraps and love the Buffalo chicken one  I love pickles so its a plus that the wraps come with a pickle They have decent pizza  They can be inconsistent though  One time the pizza will be great the next time its just meh My pap noticed that with his hoagie First time he had it he said it was great the next time it was just ok I feel like delivery takes forever and I didnt care for their chicken gyroI ordered Nachos and Tiramisu  The nachos chips were stale and the sour cream watery  The Tiramisu  was frozenThe drive calls me when he arrived and said  Im hereI said OkHe says Are you going to accept the orderI said Are you going to come to the doorOh I cant find the house"

    "review":"My friend and I ordered dinners from this place as we have for years and will not EVER waste our money here again The pork dumplings were made of mushy gooey thick dough with about 12 tsp of nasty so called pork The egg roll I ordered was disappointingly about the size of my thumb filled with grated carrots and the outside was so hard and burnt I couldnt bite it The hot and sour soup seemed to be made with beef stock instead of chicken stock and did NOT contain any wood ears bamboo shoots pork green onionscallions or tofu WTF The fried rice was actually brown rice or burnt white rice with no egg no baby peas no scallions no soy sauce or roast pork but only did contain those wonderful American grated carrots went to the dogs toothe prize of all was the Szechuan scallops The entire meals two scallops were cut into quarters and contained ONLY grated carrots and green peppers WTF is that I ask No ginger no garlic no scallions no baby corn no snow peas there were no Chinese vegetables at all I could have grated a 5 cent carrot and 14 of A green pepper myself WORST FOOD Ive ever had in my 50 years on this planet Dont WASTE YOUR MONEY I have to give it one star to be able to post this otherwise NO STAR  Id tell these people to get out of this business or get your grandparents back in there cookingFor a hotel restaurant this place is ok I had the drums and flaps wings that wont blow you away but were good enough for a late meal or maybe a happy hour My wifes calimari was below average with mushy consistency not the crispy fried calimary we were expecting If I stayed in the hotel again I would probably  eat elsewhere for a full meal and then come to the bar for drinks afterward The atmosphere is perfect for watching  a game with multiple screens around the entire room Being after 10pm there was no issue with the wait staff or service As a bar only Id give 3 stars but if youre eating food dont expect more than a 2 star experienceVinnie and the gang are the best  Great hotel bar 18 TV screens for wall to wall sports  Food is exceptional which Im usually critical of most hotels bars not being  Highly recommendFeeling trapped Dont worry because Champions is good for your food and beverage needsI stay at the Doubletree near the airport on most of my trips to Pitt It is convenient to the airport and not too far from downtown The only drawback is that the nearest restaurant aside fro Champions is two miles away and more often then not I dont have a car Not a worry though because Champions has a fine selection for small plates and full courses to meet your needs The restaurant is a sports bar with a number of sets all showing different events The crowd is mixed but mostly business travelers who tend to be courteous   The bar staff is excellent though I admit my needs are simple whiskey bourbon or craft beer  Since the bar carries my favorite bourbon they are perfect Ive had several of the small dishes and their famous Pub burger The food is 375 stars which Ive rounded to 4 The burger and fries were top notch but their calamari was dull In the morning they serve a buffet breakfast which compares to most American hotels I wish we could take a lesson from the Japanese on how to put together a breakfast spreadYou gotta try the Champions Pub Burger Its Angus beef with braised brisket and smoked Gouda combined with crispy onions on a brioche bun The flavor Is out of this world and the best part about our evening was our Great server Jennifer She is so nice Go check it out and ask for her Cheers"

    "review":"Well I filled out the comment as requested and noone contacted me Then I made the mistake of giving them another chance My order was ready this time and the burger was not burnt but instead was inedible  It tasted stale and musty with a rubbery consistency Was it old Had it sat under a heat lamp all morning Was the meat bad I got sick and vowed never againWell it all stared when I first sat down I didnt get waited on for about 20 minutes It was only 11pm at night  not a prime time When I got my silverware I noticed it was used from the bathroom The waitress gave me an attitude and I did not receive my food for another 30 minutes I am very disappointed in my eat in at the parkSeems ok until you order the food is average at best nothing special kinda like a bad Dennys service is ok then again not memorable prices are fair for the food wouldnt recommend reckon if your drunk this food is better Guess the chef who creates these dishes eats dog food thinks its greatAh Eat n Park They are consistently open What is notable here is the complete and utter absence of hipsters posers snobs or any sort of pretension whatsoever What you find at Eat n Park instead are Pittsburghs blue collar families senior citizens and teenagers out for an inexpensive meal at a surprisingly highquality local diner chain The super burger is basically a Big Mac without all the grease  and is actually quite satisfying The salad bar is always fresh and kept well stocked well sometimes the customers manage to fish out all the chicken and noodles from the chicken noodle soup leaving only the broth The service is topnotch with friendly waitstaff who could teach the waiters and waitresses at some of the more expensive fine dining establishments the area a thing or two about customer serviceAnd they have pieEat n Park is passable for certain things The hamburgers are satisfactory and although the salad bar will never be compared to the extraordinary Souplantation Sweet Tomatoes it is not bad  My wife and I were desperate for food after a late Pittsburgh Pirates game which left us few choices and we made the mistake of coming here and ordering the 999 Midnight buffet which was lousy  The eggs fried potatoes hash browns onions and mushrooms drowning in liquid were tasteless  Pancakes that are stuck to the container in which they are placed are not likely to please and the soggy waffle my wife had was not enjoyable either If I had been told that the corned beef hash was canned dog food or that it was made with Spam it would have been believable as there was no hint of beef as it is known to most people The quality of the food at Golden Corral is spectacular in comparison to Eat n Park and the value is infinitely better 899 for a breakfast buffet that includes an extensive salad selection and so much more wellprepared wellseasoned tasty items Breakfast foods are now served there throughout lunch and dinner  I do not plan to order the Eat n Park Midnight Buffet or the breakfast buffet ever again  If I do I will deserve my fate  I continue to have difficulty understanding why Eat n Park is such a spectacular success particularly given that at its other divisions including Six Penn Kitchen it has demonstrated that it knows how to prepare appealing cuisine I would have been much better off at Primanti Brothers where one can secure a late night feast: half pound cheeseburger with all the trimmings and which includes enough of the areas best french fries for an army for a mere 819  This Eat n Park location has been nicely remodeled  It is now more spacious attractive and comfortable  There is not much more  that can be said for it than thatI love this eatnpark We come here all the time because of the friendly staff and fresh tasting food I actually live closer to the west liberty location but we will drive a little further because this one is way better we havent had a bad experience yet"

    "review":"Decent beer selection and right outside the stadium Servers are not very knowledgeable on the beers that they offer Had nachos and they were just okay nothing spectacular though Nice location to watch the game if you didnt get tickets Would go backIve been to this place for lunch a few times and I while there was never anything wrong with my order Ive never been very impressed with the sandwiches  They are definitely unique recipes though so its probably just my personal preference However today I was walking by the ballpark and got a craving for a cheesesteak so I gave them another try  Unfortunately I was turned away because they apparently only serve cheesesteaks as part of a Friday special  What kind of restaurant  much less a sandwich shop doesnt have a cheesesteak on the menuNot too bad  Came here in the morning before a Sunday afternoon Pirate game and got a salad  It was the first order of the cooks morning and I actually heard him make a comment about the first order being a chicken salad deduction of a star  Also the waitress put mistakenly put in my order twice so maybe it was just the morning that was affecting her but I didnt mind but the chef didThe salad was definitely good but it was just alright and for 850 I wasnt too shabbyDominics is a nice little place to duck into and grab a meal before a game at PNC Park  and believe me the sandwiches and beer here will be a lot cheaper than what you find at the stadium From my time here they may even be better for you  not by much of course but the food here did not upset my stomach which is something stadium food is always guilty of so thats a good sign of which has better quality food options in my eyesWhile I wasnt here very long I thought they had some interesting looking menu options to consider most of which were deli or barfood sandwiches that are perfect for game days I ended up getting a chicken sandwich and water and got what I expected: a very big greasy but yummy sandwich with the right amount of additional toppings cheeses and sauces As someone else mentioned they use Boar Heads meat here and its a nice ingredient that helps bump this place up from being an ordinary sandwich shop Of course I guess the bar also makes sure this is more than an ordinary sandwich job I didnt drink while here because it was 90 degrees outside and I wanted water more than beer but from what I saw they have a very impressive selection that wont disappointI want to add that they actually had very nice service while I was there  a nice young man brought my food and even picked up the trash as soon as I was done He was very observant and attentive which really stood out in my mind because I truly expected that Id have to pick up my food and then throw the little basket it came in out myself given the casual setting that Dominics has Kudos to them for going above and beyond  Id love to come back and eat here again if I have the chanceVery friendly staffgreat beergreat atmosphere : loved itIve been here twice most recently about a year ago  I dont remember what I ordered the first time but the second time I ordered the snob caprese salad is this supposed to be a dig at foodies  It was pretty basic consisting of sliced tomatoes fresh mozzarella slices and basil leaves drizzled with balsamic vinegar but it was fresh and quite tastycomparable to versions Ive had as appetizers in Italian style restaurants  Not bad for Federal St and prices are less expensive than at SoHoThe outdoor seating provides a great place to come to people watch esp on game days  One of the days I was here before a Steelers game in Heinz Field and the street was flooded with people in black and gold with Terrible Towels  About halfway through our lunch there was a commotion at the bar across the streetfirst a police officer showed up then a fire engine and then an ambulanceand my dining partner and I wondered what in tarnation was going on over there  Finally a guy in a Steelers jersey was brought out on stretcher and loaded into the ambulance  Looks like someone must have pregamed a bit too much  The first time I was here there was also live music on the porch which was nice  Overall not a bad place to grab some grub before a game 35 stars"

    "review":"What a gem this place is The restaurant is so tastefully decorated the temperature was perfect for a hot summers day and the waitress that we had Kalin was so nice and did a great job Now about the food it was all incredibly delicious I had buttermilk pancakes with cherries and honestly those were some of the most delicious pancakes Ive ever eaten My husband had the pirogi with eggs and potatoes and said it was on point Had a coffee and a cappuccino both perfect If youre looking for a really awesome breakfast in downtown Pittsburgh do come hereI was a little worried because the place is on the fancy side and I wasnt dressed for the occasion I sat at the bar anyhow The server was so pleasant and helpful with food and wine suggestions I ordered the shrimp and chips The shrimp was HUGE Literally the biggest Id ever had or seen in my life My friend even joked that it was fake Lol Also they have a house ketchup thats to die for They could totally give Heinz a run for their money The food was well priced too The wine on the other hand was much more than I anticipated 11 for the glass I had At any rate I would go again but Ill be getting a cocktail this time And some ketchup to take back to NYC :Gave this place another try based on the managers assurance that my previous experience was unusual  Arrived now aware that entering by the back door was sure to baffle the staff and was met by the most unfriendly hostess I think the individual was pretty androgynous  She scowled at my companion and I and showed us to our seats without ever speaking a single word  The waitress initially arrived at our table with a friendly greeting and took our drink order but then disappeared for an extended period of time  This was before the lunch rush and there were only about five or six other tables of diners so I have no clue what kept her away  When she reappeared I asked for a recommendation and ordered the vegetarian masala  While this dish was good it was so very spicy that my nose was running and eyes watering throughout the meal  a warning about the spiciness level might be in order  Once she took our order we didnt see the waitress again until she brought our check with the dessert menu never asking if wed prefer separate checks  as many lunchtime diners do  Even the worst restaurants usually have a server visit you after your meal has been delivered to see if you need anything a drink refill would have been nice based on the spiciness level of my meal  While the food was good this is a very expensive place to eat lunch and should have top notch service With an option like the William Penn offering delicious food and excellent service right across the street this place really needs to step it upThe pork chop was amazing but the date sticky toffee pudding was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten Great spot when you stay at the Hotel Monaco are just downtown and nothing else is open which seems to happen on weekends Definitely worth a stop for anytime of dayGreat rooftop but drinks are a lite pricey A great place for a group as their are tons of giant board games to play for freeI visited The commoner two times because I stayed Monaco hotelTheir dishes were delicious and the interior is nice and the high ceiling is greatHowever the place was really really noise to communicate with my husband at dinner time Also the service was a little bit slow and hard to catch servers"

    "review":"Good food good service OK atmosphere  Try the sampler platters to get a bit of almost everything  Dont be afraid you silly gringosLet me start with a disclaimer: I have never eaten Ethiopian food before but have read about the concepts history and attributes of the food  We were out in Pittsburg for the Thanksgiving weekend and looking for something different to try  Tana seemed to fit the billThe service was friendly the staff pleasing and very helpful  The waitress helped explain the foods and structured a meal for us that would let us try various forms of the cuisine  The only downside of the service was our waitressbartender did not know how to fix a Bourbon and Ginger Ale  We settled on a Jack Daniels and Ginger Ale  Close enoughThe food was where things began to go down hill  Ethiopian food has a tradition of being heavily spiced and quite hot  The food we tried was very mild and honestly not terribly interesting  The Injera Teff flour spongy flat bread was good but we found it surprising it was not served warm  Now it may be that it is usually served codcool but seemed all wrong to those of us used to eating Indian Roti or NaanWe ordered 2 appetizers  Sambusa are pastry shells filled with various meats of vegetables  We had a mix of lentil beef and chicken fillings  Expecting something more akin to a Samosa these were smaller greasy and tasteless  The chicken was palatable the lentils ok and the beef awful  Think under seasoned ultra fine ground beef that has been overcooked  Yuck  My wife ordered the Ayib Bemitmita grated cottage cheese and spices and this was not served until well into the main course and was boringThe main course was a sampling of a Doro Tibs chiken dish a Tana Tibs Lamb dish Ye ater Kik Alicha split peas and Misir Wot lentils  These were served on top of a large serving of Injera  In order to preference the split peas were in fact quick enjoyable the lentils decent by less interesting  The two meat dishes were frankly boring  No spice no heat served cool and the meat was tough  A total strikeout in our opinionI am sure that Ethiopian food must be much more interesting than this however keep in mind that this was our first tasting of this regional cuisine  I would rate this as 25 starts but given our inexperience bumped to 3 stars to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubtIf youve never had Ethiopian food you will probably enjoy this rather watered down version just fine But its clear this spot is benefiting from being the only Ethiopian restaurant in town The ingira was flat not spongy All the dishes were over salted and under seasoned You didnt get that sense of multiple layers of flavor except for the lentils Just wait till you visit your friends in PhillyIve never written a review on Yelp before but I had such a crazy experience last night that I felt compelled to create an account to help save other diners from wasting their time at TanaI had a reservation at Tana for 8:30 pm and my husband and I arrived right on time After checking in the hostess left us standing at the door for at least 1520 minutes We were finally seated and looked over the menus when the hostess who was also our server and the bartender came back and informed us that the kitchen was running out of food so we should let her know what items we were interested in and shed see if there was any left We gave her our order and she came back a while later and said that they were only out of 1 of the 5 items we wanted which was fine so we replaced it with something else As our server was about to run off again I asked if we could please order some drinks we hadnt even been brought water She said yes of course but were out of cups Around 9:15 pm our server came by and said our food would be out shortly A few minutes after that she came back again and said that they were out of injera and is that alright with us We said no The whole point of eating Ethiopian food is that its served family style on injera this huge piece of flat bread that you tear off and scoop the food up with using only your hands and no utensils Without injera youd just have some piles of food Our server was very apologetic and said shed have the manager come over and talk to us and work something outWe waited for the manager about 10 minutes and never saw him During this time we called Abay another Ethiopian restaurant right around the corner and made a reservation there By the time the manager at Tana got to our table we were probably already enjoying our entrees at Abay Abay was also busy that night but they obviously know how to run a restaurant  great food great prices and they even had cupsGreat food Indians would love this place There are many options for vegetariansI always seek out the Ethiopian restaurants in a city and was pleased to find this one especially after another one nearby recently closed  The menu offerings are pretty standardmeaning nothing feels like it it is missing  The meals are about 15 and are generous in size and with a great selection 1 meat  any 2 veggies on injera  The meat was just a little bit greasy but still good  Ill be back there again soon for more berbere one of my favorite spices"

    "review":"Excellent casual business lunches  salads sandwiches  always freshly prepared and consistent quality  Family ownedAverage food nothing special Convenient to work Walk to market square for better options Service is below averageI was in Pittsburgh for 2 days And on the first lunch I was invited to a Russian lunch I thought awesome I have not had borsch kharcho blini or piroshki for a long time It was Italian restaurant with gorgeous Russian servers So that was the Russian lunch That is one great marketing strategy and it worked The place was packed with mostly men in business suits I will guess many of the men were regular customers from the way the devushki were talking with them  Oh if you are dressed in suits you are bound to get better treatment from the waitresses We were not in suits so you know the type of service we received: we had to ask for extras and refills The waitress Olga Olla gave us the menu and a paper that said they could not accept credit cards that day So we all dug into our pockets to check for enough funds for lunch We had enough Okay the food The bread was deliciously yummy Thick chewy and very high in gluten One of the best Dipped into the olive oil and balsamic vinegarit was bread lover heaven on earth We had to ask for 3 extra servingsI had grilled chicken panini and salad  The food took forever to get to our table of 4 There were definitely more Russian waitresses than cooks there That long delay was occupied with giant globs of the delicious bread soaked in olive oil and vinegar and capturing in the Russian scenery Didnt I say this was a great marketing ployWhen the lunch came the salad was pale in comparison to the bread And the panini was weaker yet How could they get the bread right and the panini wrong Maybe the bread was from bakery We had to hurry up on our lunch to make it back for a conference call Would I go back Definitely for the breadIve never had a bad meal here I usually come for lunch whether it be a quick  bite or a more relaxing meal They also have breakfast if you want a tastier egg meat and cheese sandwich than your typical Dunkin or McDonalds excuse of a breakfast  The food comes out very quick out of respect for your time It is most popular during the workday lunch rush I would say that they are most famous for their salads and sandwiches They are unique ItalianGreek creations with either feta or or red peppers on everything I particularly love their pasta de la Sandra which is a penne pasta with mushrooms sausage  peppers in a balsamic blend Yumm The Italian soup and the turkey feta hummus pepper sandwich with risotto are also among my favorites So go to Buon Giorno Cafe on your next lunch break to enjoy great service a fresh meal and at a very good priceBuon Giorno is located very close to my workplace so I often go here for lunch They offer three daily specials usually a salad a sandwich and a pasta in addition to their full menu Generally their food is good not great  I find most of their sandwiches and pastas to be a bit bland especially those made with ricotta  Instead of mixing ricotta with a sharper saltier cheese as one typically does in lasagna andor filled pastas Buon Giorno just sort of dumps it on top of penne and marinara sauce  How boring I enjoy their italian tuna salad not the kind with mayo and wedding soup All salads and soups come a few slices of Maninis bread which never disappoints  If you order a sandwich you will receive a side of the risotto usually either spinach portabello mushroom or spinach and feta The spinach and feta rice is so good my coworkers call it crack rice You always want more Another positive thing about Buon Giorno is their breakfast  They make delicious breakfast sandwiches and frittatas It is safe to say that all the small plates and sides are excellent at Buon Giorno while the main entrees are only soso  For a cafe that is only open for breakfast and lunch downtown thats really all you need But dont go to Buon Giorno expecting a high quality Italian meal"

    "review":"After reading the previous reviews Im a bit confused  Maybe its because I got delivery and didnt step foot in the doorI actually enjoyed the food  The smaller portion as their menu put it is the same size as other restaurants regular portions  I got my old reliable General Tsos nice portion of meat to rice and an egg came with the comboI even waited a day to write this to make sure that I wasnt going to feel all that bad  Ill definitely go back here especially for the priceAs a DC native my standards for takeout are pretty up there and New China Inn didnt even satisfy my craving I ordered online through Foodler great site btw All I really wanted was veggie lo mien but in order to fulfill the delivery minimum I also ordered the pork dumplings and Im so glad that I did The veggie lo mien literally tasted like a farm urine hay and all sorry for such a disgusting description but that was all I could think of as I was trying to get the taste out of my mouth But the pork dumpling were pretty good They come in an order of 8 and I was full after the 4th oneFood was nasty the crab ragoon were hard as hell and the rice was so dry and tasteless will never order from this place again have some pride in ur food will pass the word around if u want good Asian food go to w liberty aveDisgusting No really I love chinese and have never been so dissapointed I ordered orange chicken and white rice Chicken was rubbery and tasteless and a few hours later i couldnt stop vomiting and ive NEVER gotten sick from chinese style food before Please find somewhere elseThis is just a local Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood so if you dont have a high expectation you wont be disappointed It closes late so it is very convenient if you starve for Chinese food at a late hour otherwise go to other onesI would rank this place closer to 15 stars  I like their super large and cheap helping of crab ragoon but not much elseEverything else here has been pretty gross  I had their duck once and it was super old duck  Im sure it was cooked for at least 3 days and then stuck in the oven to heat up so it was super dry tough and disgusting  That pretty much sums everything upEvery time I come here I am disappointed  Why I continue to visit is beyond me"

    "review":"Sandwiches are good However they have the BEST chocolate chip cookies They are super buttery and its like they put a piece of chocolate and in between to delicious cookies You have to act fast as they do sell out of themVery good sub shop in a really busy section of the city I love their chicken parm subs that are made with grilled chicken with the option of mushrooms and onions I recommend this place if youre in the area looking for a quick bite to eatWow I am a long time fan and customer but will never go back to this location  Ridiculously rude incompetent crewPenn Station offers a delicious selection of subs with a bit of an unhealthy structure to the building of the sandwich They let you do whatever you want if they have it they will sell it to you on the sub The staff and service is always above par A thing that I appreciate in a fast food environment In fact service is excellent here on the regular As for the three star review I base that mostly on the price point which is a bit high for my perceived market value Also and I know the fries are made fresh but somehow I always get more disappointing fries in my batch than delicious ones Not sure how that happensReal good spot in Monroeville to grab a quick sandwich hot or cold Last time I went it was 30 minutes before close and the employees didnt mind Fries were delicious too Definitely go here if you want something quick and that tastes goodI cant seem to get a normal cold sub in this city Grilled subs are fine but sometimes I just want a good old fashioned Italian hoagie I ordered a cold Italian sub at Penn Station and I got cold toppings on a toasted bun Ugh Ill have to remember to be more specific next time Overall just OK"

    "review":"Cliffs Notes: solid concept exceptional decor room for improvement in the kitchen The AMPD Group is at it again This time theyve opened their 2nd Steel Cactus location in the city The new spot takes the place of the old Villa barclub but youd be hardpressed to even recognize it The AMPD Group did an outstanding job with the renovation and decor When you walk in the front door you are greeted immediately by a cheery hostess I came here for lunch and the crowd was much lighter than I expected however they havent even been open two weeks yet I give them credit for opening up this time of year the crowd may be thin now but this will be the place to be come spring and summer  The first thing former Villaites will notice is the space The first floor of Steel Cactus seems SO much larger than Villa ever did There are several high top tables of varying sizes ample seating at the bar and large booths so theres definitely a seating option for parties of all sizes  They have also redone all of the outer walls with collapsible doorswindows that open right onto the street Now to the food  As I mentioned this place just opened up and it seemed obvious to me that maybe the kitchen staff hasnt got their bearings yet We ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and it was lukewarm with a lot of unmelted chunks of cheese in it My boyfriend ordered a side salad but received a HUGE portion that he ended up taking 34 of in a doggie bag  The salad was delicious though try it with the mango vinaigrette We also split 3 steak tacos which were good but underseasoned Also no sour cream or salsa was served or offered with them  Another suggestion would be to offer different beans on the side I wouldve liked to see refried beans as an option Overall I think this place will find great success here on East Carson Street it just may take some time for the whole crew to get the machine welloiled  I dont live far from this spot at all so I will definitely be back to give them many many more chances to improve They also have completely redone the 2nd floor and Im looking forward to checking that out soonThe food is good but the service sucks Last night it took like 15 minutes to get a waitress and when she finally came she graciously reminded us that the kitchen was closing on 10 minutes Wouldnt have felt as bad ordering that late if we had gotten a waitress when we came in She also just acted like she had a stick up her ass which definitely put us off even more For the most part the bartenders dont know what theyre doing and would rather sit on their phones behind the bar than get anyone a drink There are some rare gems that have more than two brain cells that work here but definitely rareI was excited to try this place since I love Mexican food Pretty disappointing We had the chips with pineapple salsa and the pineapples in the salsa tasted rancid I had the huevos rancheros the taste was okay but nothing major Could have had more eggs The corn tortillas were burnt as well Service was below average Id possibly try the place again for lunch or dinner instead of the brunch Well seeThis time it was MUCH better First scene the hostess was no where to be found so we were almost sat by the bouncer bouncer on a Thursday night Our server was Joey I think everyone there kept calling him JoJo Very sweet guyWe all shared a queso dip My boyfriend and I had the molcajete bowl which lets be real is the only thing you should ever get at Steel Cactus and my friend had the chicken fajitas We came in for Wine night on Thursday which they were out of the Bluefeld riesling but Joey came by and showed us 2 other options that were just as reasonable Estancia Chardonnay  Naked Unfortunately for Joey the hostess had seated us without silverware so he had to run and grab some and the wine glasses could have used a wipe down or a wash prior to being given to us my friends had red wine and lipstick on it stillThe bread pudding dessert of the week was fantastic so good that my boyfriend ended up stealing most of it from meAll in all the food and the server were the best part of the restaurant This visit was infinitely better than my last visit but could still use some improvementMy new friend and I went here after having a very disappointing experience in another nearby restaurant   What a pleasant surprise  The service was great the food in expensive and DELICIOUS Nothing fancy  Just simple good tasting tex mex food Yummy We WILL be returningI never write reviews but I had to give these guys a shout out Visiting pgh with some friends we went out for the night on Carson st Steel Cactus looked cool so we went in for dinner Our dinner turned into 2hrs cause we didnt want to go The food was really good but even if it wasnt I would still go back Our server Jane was awesome The way the staff all the way to the mgr Kelly  interacted with each other and the customers really makes the difference You can see they genuinely enjoy the job and the customers It wasnt the fake smiles and how can I help you that you usually get at places We left our cc so we had to go back and ended up staying until the bar closed All the places on Carson but these guys get it"

    "review":"Its a Dunkin Donuts shop like most others so what you see is what you getI like their dark roast coffee and its been fresh every time Ive gone there Their hot chocolate is good too When I take my son they put in an extra dab of milk so its not too hot and it doesnt water it down like ice does  thats really thoughtful and makes him happyBaked goods and breakfast sandwiches are average but consistentService is average Ive never had any problemsThere are not a lot of places in this area to meet up with a friend besides the bars so I am very happy they are in my neighborhoodMy favorite one in the city They always get my coffee right its just hoticed blueberry with cream no sugar which doesnt seem complicated but the DD on 51 always screws it up as do Oakland and Squirrel Hill I only docked this one a star because they never put enough chocolate icing on their donuts The drivethru folks are always friendly tooIm not a regular customer here or anything but every time I do come here Im disappointed The customer service is always poor This time I felt rushed and I had no help with any questions Eyes were rolled and my card was snatched out of my hand and half shoved back into my hand Im surprised my iced coffee didnt explode when it was slammed onto the counter in front of me I also got a sausage egg and cheese croissant which was greasy beyond belief Like I get that its in the category of fast food but this was ridiculous It tasted like cleaner Im giving this 2 stars because my coffee ended up being delicious Im just overall unhappyI LoVe to come in and get chicken salad sandwiches on croissants and carmel machiottos Tab is always friendly and helpful  She is also very knowledgeable about the cups when they come in and I like that because I upgrade mine often Xander and Janice are also very nice and helpful  I always see them cleaning when no one is at the counter which is almost never and they both always have cheerful happy things to conversate about I do get frustrated when the employees dont have everything they need to do their job  Or when my croissants run out or arent made at all  Itd be nice if things were a little more stable for both the employees and the customers"

    "review":"I have been a fan of this Applebees since I was a little girl who would come here and only eat their amazing cheeseburgers and layered chocolate cake I was heartbroken when said layered chocolate cake was taken off of the menu but now that Im of legal age other parts of the menu have made up for this More on that laterI think compared to other restaurants in the chain this Applebees is a little bit smaller than other places but the essentials are all there: comfy seating a bar TVs and most importantly: good service Plus it has the essential Applebees staple: a darn good menu Well I think its good anyway If you like Applebees menus in other lcoations youll like the one here In recent years its also adopted a light option menu which is positively delicious and provides perfect alternatives to things like that tasty but notsogoodforme burger I used to eat on a regular basis Fortunately steak with shrimp and potatoes and the perfect balance of spices on top make up for my inability to always indulge in my original favorite mealAlso: this place is home to one of the biggest margaritas Ive ever seen Joes Crab Shack still takes the prize for 1st place but 2nd is no small feat no pun intended and this place is much closer and easier for me to get to Also free parking  always a big plusAll in all I still enjoy stopping in here for a good meal and I plan on continuing to come here in the years to comeLoved our server JaimeLoved their Brew Pub PretzelsLove their Take Two Seasonal Menu the Green Goddess Wedge Salad and the  Lemon Shrimp FettucineRocky Bleier was there Yaylove love love the steaks they make there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebees because I want their stake I eat stakes everywhere even the Japanese Steak Houses where they only make steaks werent like Applebees :the only No at this place was I oredered pine apple juice and it was so old that it smelled and tasted and kind of even looked like Moldbut other than that I love theirr Stakes :Absolutely love coming here Me and my girlfriend stop in at least once a week Weve been coming here for about a year now and have made it our place to go The food is just like any other Applebees however when you stop in as often as we do the staff begins to recognize you Were always treated great here wether it be by the greeters our server or sometimes even the managerI had a wonderful experience at the Green Tree Applebees restaurant on my way through Pittsburgh Even though it was Saturday evening Applebees was able to accommodate a group of eight with no problem They had a nice corner table availableThe waitress was fabulous She continually came to refill drinks and update us on the status of our order The steak was excellent Applebees steak has a great flavor and I had to trim very little grissle off of it The only downfall is some of the side items have very little flavor This restaurant offers a small childrens menuApplebees can be a costly trip but just prepare in advance for it This particular Applebees sits up on a hill in a small plaza If it wasnt for Google Navigation I probably would have driven right by this restaurantOverall I highly recommend this Applebees locationI am giving it 2 stars ONLY because the manager was nice Our waitress was awfulthe food was inediblehow do you screw up mashedinstant mashed by the managers admissionpotatoes Consistently of cement and zero taste How does a cook forget butter and salt How do you cook and send out a medium steak that is so well done that it cant be cut Save the money and the frustration and go somewhere else  I came home and made a delicious grilled cheese"

    "review":"What a little gem in Shadyside I lived here for 3 years right down the road and never went here However I just went in last night for the 3 veggie burger special Unfortunately I didnt realize that the special was only for 9midnight but that did not stop me from still getting the burger and leave me wanting to go here next Wednesday night A friend and I stopped in here after work and just made it in time for happy hour which I would say is not very good compared to similar restaurants drafts are only 1 off However the list is pretty incredible and they do have good drinks specials on other nights I think I read they have 1 mixed drinks on Thursday nights which makes me want to go back tonight and take the morning off work tomorrow We received our burger check list and I was pleasantly surprised and the diversity of sauces toppings and addons to my burger You can get up to 4 toppings free further the happy hour included halfoff a basket of fries The quality of the burger was very good I enjoyed the food the venue which I didnt realize until I walked out that there is an entire second floor with a full bar and tables upstairs and I am looking forward to coming back to enjoy some of the specialsStackd is a small quaint bar in somewhat of a pricy area but believe it or not their prices were very reasonable  The burgers came out fast and were delicious as were the fries and we even got an order of Pierogi which were also very good Great selection of beer and just a nice casual place to hang out have a beer and a greattasting burger without breaking the bankI got a 34 lb burger fries and fried pierogi for take out I hate sitting in that extremely noisy placeWhen I went there on a Saturday 18:40 the place seemed understaffed and the staff appeared really stressed You are expected to seat yourself so I sat down and rotated my head looking around for about 10 minutes before a staff member came and threw a menu cardorder sheet at me It then took about 25 minutes for my order to be completed  fairly reasonable speed considering how busy it wasThe 34 lb burger came with three 14 lb patties Each was a bit dry but overall the burger was pretty good The fried pierogi were big and pretty standard The fries were nothing special  a bit worse than McDonalds fries Overall it was decent value for the meal considering how customizable everything is but nothing is particularly outstanding The value is even better if you show up on half price time Tuesday 9pm to MidnightI had high hopes for this place and I left disappointed I went opt here on 1 well night with my roommates We went early and all ordered food I ordered a burger with BBQ and Chrissy Onions I was disappointed when I got my burger and it was just a burger with sauce on it My other roommate ordered onion and mushrooms on hers and received hers with no mushrooms Turns out my missing onions and her missing mushrooms ended up on the other roommates burger Good thing she likes onions and mushrooms It was starting to get busy by the time we got our food and the waitress just disappeared She dropped off the checks and then an hour later she came back to pick them up I was expecting slow service due to the 1 well night and completely understand due to being in the service industry before Over all I was very disappointed with the food My burger could have been amazing But it wasnt There are so many other build your own burger places in Pittsburgh Ill probably be going elsewhere next timeI found this to be exactly what i needed  I was able to watch some March Madness while enjoying a nice selection of craft beers and some good grub in a smoke free friendly place The burgers are MYO I made veggie with fresh jalapeo  avocado and Chipotle mayo  Im picky when it comes to veggie patties so i consulted the chefbar tender first  He said it was made with black beans and very  good  He was right  It was great Fresh  tasty  slightly crunchy on the outside warm and moist inside I didnt order fries  so youre on your own there  That guy and the other bar tender were both very friendly and attentive  Ill be back  for sureThe burgers were great and it was a fresh experience to order with a card and check off what I wanted Definitely a great experience and great food"

    "review":"I really struggled to rate this one To start the interior is very modern and I loved the sliding doors that open up next to the outdoor seating These were open when we sat down and then the manager closed them As he was closing them we overheard him using explicit language because he couldnt get the doors to shut properly Now Im not saying I dont drop swear words because I do but as a customer it seems a bit unprofessional On another note the waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive She asked if we wanted more bread and that was a no brainer bc it was so GOOD She was also great about filling our drinks We both ordered the almond chicken with risotto and spinach The chicken was good a tad bit dry but that Brie creme sauce helped out a bit We both thought the chicken pieces were pretty small too for 20 a plate The risotto was probably my favorite part because it wasnt overpowering with cheese At this point Im not sure how I feel about returningWe were ravenous when we arrived after a morning of wedding dress shopping and we didnt have much time because we had another appointment after lunch Our server was very nice Among the 4 of us we had 2 turkey burgers 1 salmon taco and 1 chicken with brie cream sauce The food was good but nothing spectacular My turkey burger was rather small particularly for the size of the bun even after I pulled off some excess bread The tortellini salad lacked any flavor whatsoever My sisters sweet potato fries were delicious The service was decent but we had told our server what time we needed to leave and we waited quite a while for her to give us a check we were almost late for our appointment She apologized saying she got stuck on a long phone call Not sure why a server is taking phone calls at the restaurant or whether it was even related to work Either way it was a decent lunch spot but I wouldnt rush backWe used to go to Bistro 19 for Sunday brunch with our parents and when we have out of town guests but I find that we are visiting Bistro less and less At first I was a raving fan back when service was great portions were large and they had Filet and Hash as one of their brunch meals The Filet and Hash was taken off of the menu probably about a year and a half ago and since then I have a hard time finding something else that I like there I usually end up with Eggs Benedict or the boring Bistro Brunch The portions have gotten smaller and the service team is just meh Bring the Filet and Hash back BistroWent here for a birthday dinner We started with the duck confit flatbread and lemon pepper calamari Both were very good and could feed a lot of people The calamari was very light and was served with a great horseradish sauceFor dinner I had the Chilean sea bass which the waiter said was their specialty dish It was pretty good and very fillingOverall it was a nice place Cute interior right in uptown and good foodFood is decent enough but a little pricey for what it is Bartenders are friendly and have a few nice spins on drinks A plus for warmer weather dining are the large front windows being openIve been to Bistro 19 a couple of times for dinner but this review is mainly based on a recent lunch experience I joined a friend who frequents B19 at least once a week for lunch She raves about the food and reasonable lunch prices At 12 on a recent Wednesday there were about 5 other tables in the restaurant I looked over the menu and decided to indulge my inner carnivore with a bacon cheese burger which came with a side of tortellini salad The menu had an array of sandwiches and lunch entrees Some of your favorites were included burger wrap but were done with a gourmet twist There were also heavier meals entrees like almond chicken with brie rice and veggies We were served bread and butter while we waited Within a few minutes my well done burger arrived Although ordering well done could often result in a dry rubbery slab of beef this burger was juicy and tender In fact it was so tender that the burger fell apart a little as I chomped down big bites The accompanying tortellini salad was light and refreshing I also chomped down on my friends green beans which were cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic Overall a great lunch experience at a reasonable cost If you are looking for an above average lunch with reasonable prices 912 Bistro 19 is a great choice"

    "review":"Rivers casino grandview buffet mediocre overpriced food Same menu for four years no change in menu items or presentation of food Do not waste your money Why is it you think they give free booze on Sundays Cheap food costsThe Grandview is never disappointing and I give it AOK three stars its a buffet My experience here is primarily lunch though I have been here for dinner once The salad bar offers a variety of fresh greens and prepared salads such as three bean tuna chicken etc  The hot food sections are consistent in quality The sushi is a must though it is very basic The dessert bar is probably the finest Ive seen at a buffet I have not had the breakfast buffet here but I would not be surprised if it was up to par All in all the Grandview offers consistency and is a good value Show your players club card and receive 10 discountWe used to love to eat here Now we sadly will not be back The buffet has been filthy the last few times we were there Looked like pigs trampled through it No more crab legs offered on buffet Cost is extra No more Verdi or mimosas on Sunday brunch Also extra Was offered a piece of charcoal they tried to pass off as beef They shouldve just told us they were out instead of giving us a petrified piece of meat They really went downhill It was our favorite place to eat Not anymoreSTAY AWAY Unless you are a senior citizen First they seat the seniors closest to the buffet fine but everyone else was seated at the very back of the restaurant I mean the very back we were against the wall where all the bus boys were taking the plates glasses and silverware and all you heard was banging The waitress even had to yell to ask us a question and she yelled in my husbands earNOW for the food Everything was soft like baby food except for the meat which was so dry that it was hard to swallow and there was no gravy to be found  The beef was so tough I couldnt even cut it with my knife  There were 12 types of potatoes I am not kidding at least 3 types of stuffing soft veggies The Italian food food was worse than any pizzeria Ive ever been to and the Chinese food was well just awful  WARNING stay away  from the fish there were 4 types and they were so dry that it was like the chef had never made fish before If you think there will be some redemption at the dessert bar youd be wrong The bread pudding was completely tasteless and even the cookies tasted like the Pillsbury cut and bake cookies Also It was 1999 and the 1599 advertised  We called twice about price and parking and they never said the was was 1999 And be prepared for a very very long walk threw a smoky casino to get to the buffetWent to the casino for the first time on Friday the 20th  for the sole purpose of having the buffet What a mistake For over 4200 paid for a friend I encountered food not fit for the garbage dump There was not one item that was not old cold or dry Only one seafood item an awful looking mess labeled tilapia Apparently the price for this swill has been fluctuating over the past few months and seems to be missing the mark The quality of this buffet puts it squarely in the 899 to 1099 range depending on how many items are actually edible I cannot believe Rivers Casino would allow this embarrassment to exist In comparison Golden Corral is fine dining I mentioned the poor quality to our server and she agreed it was bad and business has fallen off considerably Rather than bringing the manager to the table she suggested I find him on the way out if I wished to complain I didnt bother since I wasnt looking for a freebie and if the manager remotely cared the situation wouldnt exist in the first place If you plan on going to the casino for the buffet  do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else Anywhere elseLoved loved loved   Food is amazing Prime rib cooked perfect  You can just eat and eat and wont find a bad thing about it  Service was great and friendly  Will return"

    "review":"This place never loses its charm on me The service is amazing the food is out of this world and the atmosphere is very comfortable If you want to really spend alot of money on quality food This place is for youMy husband and I celebrated our 53rd anniversary last evening at Eddie Merlots and everything was wonderful  Our servers Cameron and David couldnt have been any better  they were both personal caring and very attentive  The manager Larry even helped us to our parking spot  We were a little hesitant about driving to Pittsburgh for dinner but directions were easy validated parking was a perk and eating at this restaurant was definitely worth it  I cant say enough about the taste and quality of the food  We both had the summer grill for 89 for two  had the 7oz filet mignon salad and veg  They kindly gave us a complimentary drink before dinner and an amazing dessert after dinner  Thanks to everyone at E for helping us celebrate 53 wonderful years  Well be backFlawless all around Our waitress Kelly was pleasant and funny The wine selection on the iPad is really fun and extremely insightful for someone like me who isnt a big wine drinker My fianc and I started out with the steak pot stickers and they were very good The both of us were extremely happy with our suggested wine selection from the iPad My fiance got lobster bisque and said there were huge chunks of lobster and the soup was overall perfect Since I couldnt convince my lady to split the 30 ounce Waygu with me I opted for the 10 oz filet THE BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER EATEN Bar none We split eddies potatoes which are cheesy and delicious My fianc ordered the filet medallions which come 1 peppercorn very peppery 1 bacon gorgonzola  and 1 oscar style Aside from the peppercorn sauce being a little overbearing she enjoyed the dish very muchI chose the Peanut Butter Cup dessert and like the rest of the meal it didnt disappoint The presentation was very nice as well The ONLY negative to all of this is the price It certainly wont be a weekly visit for us but definitely will now be considered any time we want to go somewhere nice for an occasion or when we refer friends to a place to eat in the cityFantastic night Came here for the first time during restaurant week and was not disappointed The french onion soup and Cesar salad starters were your standard fare but the entrees and drinks were on point Husband got the Steak Diane and I had the Cedar Roasted Salmon The beef tenderloin was so tender probably the best Ive ever tasted The carrot cake dessert was amazing With the three courses we left feeling completely stuffed Looking at the full menu there are so many options to chose from but be warned the prices are not for the faint of heart Glad we got to test it out during restaurant week as this place will probably be reserved for special occasionsHands down the best steakhouse I have ever been too nationwideThe staff and food are just phenomenalTry the lobster mac and cheese and the carrot cakeAlso Love the iPad menusThis quite possibly was one of the best dining experiences ever  We arrived with a party of 14 seated promptly and attended to with perfection by our waitress Tera  She was able to perfectly suggest apps that were not too much or too little for the table The presentation of the apps were eye appealing and they all tasted delicious  We ordered the sesame calamari ahi tuna wontons and crab cakes all were cooked to perfection an beautifully presented  Dinner for me was sesame ahi tuna slightly seared but left perfectly rare served with seaweed salad  Yummmmmm  Others tried the braised short ribs various cuts of steaks salmon and the roasted bell and evens chicken  There was not one complaint at the table everything was cooked perfectly  Then came dessertWOW  We had 2 tableside presentations bannanas foster and vanilla congnac brownie with a creme brule also  Do yourself a favor and order one of the tableside presentations delicious and worth it for the presentation by the waitstaff  This is one amazing restaurant decor wine choices which were simply jawdropping ambiance service food and value I said value because I think that for apps meal and dessert with this type of perfection that was about 100  per person without drinks is reasonable This is not something i could afford often but would certainly want to visit several times a year if I lived local which sadly i do not  Please come to CT MA or RI we would welcome you with open arms  Thank you for a really memorable meal and remember ask for TeraKerry"

    "review":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago for lunch with my father  We were looking for a nearby no frills place and this seemed to work  Whenever we entered the restaurant it was easy to see that it looked like a traditional diner having a lunch counter on one side and a number of smaller booths on the other After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Reuben sandwich with a side of onion rings while my dad went with the fish sandwich with a side of fries  The first thing that I ended up trying was the onion rings and I have to admit that I was impressed  They had a nice cornmeal like coating on them and were breaded so that you could tell they were onions unlike many of those premade thick breaded ones  The flavor and texture of them was good as they were crunchy and seasoned decently  At this point I was thinking wow this place is going to surprise me but it was all downhill from there  My reuben ended up being ok it didnt have anything wrong with it but it was not terribly exciting either  Then I tried my dads fries  Soggy and limp ugh such a bad contrast from the onion rings  When all was said and done the total cost for the sandwiches and sides mentioned with a single iced tea was 21  Thats a bit steep if you ask meThe bottom line for me is that I might return here again in the future  I thought that it was bit overpriced for the quality of food delivered but at least my onion rings were goodThis place is an awesome small town diner The staff is friendly  genuinely tries to make connections with regulars The kitchen is quick but doesnt sacrifice the quality of the food I highly recommend the mixed grill especially if youre hungoverLove this place Friendly fast service everything Id expect from a diner Love the open concept grillkitchen Granted Ive only been here for breakfast a lot I never leave wanting moreLiving in Bellevue this is our favorite stop for breakfast when we dont feel like making it ourselves or travelling too far away to get something  This is definitely a diner and the food is what you would expect from that  There is nothing wrong with any of the flavors or meals they provide  It is definitely a solid meal  The service is always good and fast and since we can walk here we frequent it pretty often  I cant say anything about other meals but their breakfast is pretty good and I will continue to eat it as long as I live in the areaLove the Bellevue Diner I head there after some duck pin bowling at the K of C on Lincoln Always a great mealObviously this is going to be very basic since we visited for breakfast and got typical breakfast food I ordered 2 eggs egg beaters bacon and toast My boyfriend had the 3 eggs overeasy bacontoast and homefries The bacon was really good quality and was thick and cooked perfectly for me  Eggs are eggs as is toast His homefries looked delicious and were nice thick potatoes He said they were very tasty The coffee was very good as well which for me is essential for breakfast I have lived in Bellevue a couple years now and this was my first trip into the diner It has a counter and several booths with some tables in the back Very typical 1950s like So if anyone is ever near Bellevue and needs to grab a bite for breakfast I would recommend stopping in They also serve lunch which again seemed like typical diner fare Coming here I feel is more for the unique diner experience rather than the spectacular not saying it was not a decent breakfast food"

    "review":"This is the best delivery pizza Ive ever had I ordered online through them an XL pizza with half covered in tomatoes and half covered in bacon and pepperoni with extra sauce When I added a fountain soda to the order they gave me the option to get breadsticks for free and I opted to get cheesy ones for an extra 2 yeah they got me with that The crust is not remarkable but I love their pizza sauce It is very sweet which might not hit everyone the right way The ingredients they use are really good my friend who was eating the meaty side said that it was the best pepperoni hed ever had The pieces are cut really well too Im not a vegetarian but I appreciated that I didnt have to worry about any random peps or bacon pieces on my half The breadsticks were delicious too the only thing is that it only has cheese on top in the middle and is cut in half lengthwise and into a bunch of slices perpendicular to that so that there are 4 non cheesy slices on the ends I was OK with this because I love any kind of white bread that is crunchy so they were very good to me They gave us two ranch dipping cups with the pizza and we got a marinara one which my friend liked Getting a 32oz fountain soda was much cheaper than getting something bottled but it did come with a ton of ice in the cup If youre looking for quality delivery pizza definitely get some pizza from pizza careThe pizza was okay It reminded me of like a slightly better little Caesars Hey it was cheap why am I really complaining  Well I dined at noon on a weekday in the summer The building was empty no biggie except I was stared at almost the entire time I was eating The most awkward note to eat ever Service here is terrible paired with the EHH food I do not recommend Sign on the front said grand opening so maybe new owners because the previous results were so greatPepperoni and tomato pizza on whole wheat crust was excellent I didnt have to wait long either I will be back to try something else I hope u will be opening more stores soonMassive disappointment Tiny and not satisfying especially for the 1599 price for a medium Which was tiny Dry crust chewy cheese skimpy toppings I wasnt greeted for several minutes Just about walked out Just dont go there are much better options in townIm impressed  Reasonable maybe a little pricey prices but they have a lot of options plain whole wheat whole grain  glutenfree crust and nice fresh ingredients  I used Eat24 to order this and anywhere that allows me to order from my smartphone is already ahead in my book Pizza came nice  hot  Buffalo fries appear to be freshly cut not uniform and also piping hot  The delivery driver actually ran up my front stepsIts like so hard to describe this place I try to give them business I support local businesses However the customer service is HORRIBLE HERE with milanos down the street this place cant afford to slack This place doesnt have a good atmosphere and the food sucks People would rather pay more for good quality and the pizza here just isnt it I ordered cheese fries with bacon and they put ham on itthat should tell you what you need to know"

    "review":"Great sandwiches and great customer service Everyone there are very attentive to customers The sandwiches are made warm and ready And are great Would recommend it to anyoneI asked the girl named Hope A couple of questions like who palm premium as regards to regular gas because I ride a motorcycle in premium works best and I was given an attitude and told I didnt know I put my car into a gas pump and trying to put my fuel I was asked to see a customer attended by the gas pump I went inside and asked if I could leave my payment card with her if she could just open the pump like every other gas station in America 10 and was given an attitude and told that she was only taught one way and that was for me to leave them out unknown to me to fill up my gas tank and that if there was any change left over it would be refunded into my account in a weeks time this left very unsettling feeling in my stomach and I left the gas station without being a customer of the gas station I asked for the corporate number and I was told that I could call the store and speak with her but my call would not be answered by a manager or anyone else for this I will neverbe a customer of this location ever again and I will be calling corporate as soon as I can find out their informationWonderful sandwiches and excellent customer care Everyone there are quite careful to customers The sandwiches are made warm and prepared And are excellent Would recommend it to anyoneNice gas station The coffee counter is great Made to order coffee at a gas station isnt a new concept in Pgh This location does need to step up their game and offer more sugar free options like Sheetz  Get Go if theyre going to get in the hand crafted gas station coffee game The location is clean The staff is very friendly and professional  There arent a lot of kid friendly quick choices that are inexpensive so I dont tend to make this our first choice for stopping when we need family snacks There are healthy choices but they seem to ring up a bit higher when compared to other locations5 stars for a service station When its the new American Natural yes Its much MUCH more than just a gas station first they also sell natural gas for hybrid and cars than run strictly on clean natural gas My first visit was to fill up my car with gas I noticed the gas was not marked up higher like normal convenience store has is When I went inside I was shocked to see a full service sandwich bar selling high end pressed sandwiches like Cubans Jamaican jerked chicken eggplant parmigiana and capresi Also a coffee station with espresso lattes and other coffee treats In the morning they sell amazing breakfast sandwiches with turkey sausage egg and cheese and others  Pressed sandwiches are about 695 and they will personalize them any way you wish Stop in for lunch I only wish they had a place to sit down and eatAmerican Natural is one high class filling station and a welcome addition to PittsburghIve been here a few times because its gas near downtown Also I park at the station square lot sometimes and its convenient to get gas afterwards Staff is nice and they have the basic plus some other goodies Gas is on both sides of the shop fyi"

    "review":"They start you off with 2 very different sauces: a spicy green habanero sauce and a sweet purple berry sauce and they are the two halves of my heart Also if you want spicy just ask and theyll kick it up to 11 Get take out if you dont want to sit in a relatively empty joint Other than that if you want indian food this is a great place8 for taste 5 for atmosphereThis place is mediocre for Indian food We had the dinner buffet which comes with naan bread fountain soda and chai tea which is real yummy  The price with tax is 1286 The lighting is dim in this place Especially over the buffet which makes no sense Service is sub par One server for the whole joint Atmosphere is decent They have warm lighting and a brick wall Over all not bad but not greatI went during Restaurant Week since it was a perfect opportunity to try some Indian food in the area I got a togo box from the lunch buffet The selection isnt large but its goodtheres a small salad bar galub jamun naan rice and about six entreestyle options The food is goodHowever the person at the register seemed annoyed at me when I asked about their Restaurant Week special and when I paid He left before I handed him the signed receipt and told me to leave it on the counter which I didnt feel very comfortable doing The second time I went I was charged full price until I asked about the Restaurant Week special I guess this is understandable but I didnt feel comfortable paying for my food However this place is the closest Indian restaurant to where I live so Ill probably be back when Im craving someWe came in for dinner and ordered two dishes from the menu both of which were fantastic The waiter was very attentive and the food came out very hot Rice portions were small as to ensure that it did not get cold but more was provided upon request I am a fan of spicy food but i found a seven scale 1 to 10 to be extremely spicy I would not recommend going any hotterI have eaten here twice so far and both times had a great experience  I can not speak for the buffet but ordering from the menu the food was very good  Surprisingly empty both times I went so the service was great as well The food was definitely a little less spicy then I was expecting but not a bad thing I recommend the chai tea it is fantasticThis is one of the worst Indian food Ive had in a while I went there for the dinner buffet and started with the appetizers The pakoras were too dry They had no taste in them The chicken biryani was basically uncooked rice with small pieces of unsavory chicken And the Tandoori chicken had an unusual smell to it Coming to the main course: The chicken tikka masala had a rubberlike texture The saag and the malai kofta even though had rich gravy had practically the same taste too buttery The chicken curry was good The only thing I really liked about the food was the dessert They had mango ice cream kheer and gulab jamun Conclusion: If you guys want to taste authentic Indian food avoid this place This will leave a bad taste in your mouth It does not justify the 12 10 on student ID price tag I would not go there again Also my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts"

    "review":"Even as a vegetarian I felt REALLY silly ordering orange wheat gluten or sesame soy protein But their vegetarian menu is fantastic Im happy ordering veggies and tofu and Asian restaurants But I really miss sesame chicken and I can get it at China Palace The food itself is every so slightly above par Its a little sweet but not too oily I cant vouch for their meat dishes as the person I went with is also veg They really manage to create satisfying typical Chinese dishes with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eatersIts definately expensive we paid 40 for three entrees and a salad And theres other Chinese food thats just as good for less money But for vegetarians who miss typical dishes China Place is so the place to goThis is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town Great location great veggie options Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty  Only 2 things that bother me the hot and sour soup is TOO hot I cant eat it And its not easy to find a parking space Lots of driving around to find a spot But the restaurant is definitely worth checking outMy husband and 2 yr old daughter went there for a lunch We arrived at noon and the place was complete empty but we witnessed a transformation as it got full by the time we left The staff was helpful and prompt to bring a straw for my daughter to have her water We shared a palace duck which consists n boneless strips of duck with stir fried veggies broccoli baby corn bamboo the usual covered with sauce It was not memorable but definitely heartwarming and a good choice for a quick Sunday family lunch We also had fried pork dumplings for appetizer and egg drop soup which were averageThe general Tso chicken we spotted on another table seemed to be a popular choice and looked tasty next time we will try that one for suregood food  large quantitiesif you like spicy food ask for the cs16 very spicy sichuan dish will make the same dish with shrimp for an extra chargefriendly service for a chinese restaurantGood food  They use good ingredients and present dishes well  If they werent in Shadyside which peaked 40 years ago theyd get the acclaim they deserveThe worst ever Chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurantI ordered lo mien with steak it wasnt even steak and it was cold enoughFuture actions: will not come again for sure"

    "review":"Great little place to hole up for a few cocktails off the beaten path Dark and secluded Strong drinks If I was negotiating terms of a defection this wouldnt be a bad place to either think about it alone or sign the papersDawn the face of this operation and behind the scenes too is a fantastic bartender When I arrived to meet my boyfriend and his friend Dawn was explaining to them about the gin rickey cocktail and the gimlet I started asking her more about the gimlet and said in hadnt had cheery in a gimlet ever I then proceeded to look at the menu and then informed Dawn I had made my choice She looked at me and said let me guess After a few seconds of her feeling into my selection and personality she said apricot gimlet By golly she was right Dawn has that magical bartender intuition that only someone who understands people and well thought out crafted cocktails could have  After being there for a 15 minutrs or so she brought us complimentary warm spiced almonds The apricot gimlet was very nice not too atrong or sweet it was balanced and refreshing also makes a nice old fashioned We will be going back because to DawnVery cool little place in the basement of the Omni Definitely an old school vibe type spot Dawn the bartender was awesome Try the Moscow Mule or just tell her what you like and shell whip you up something Worth a visitService was poor Long wait for a drink even though it wasnt busy Worst old fashioned Ive had Much better optionsMy wife and I were celebrating our anniversary in Pittsburgh and were staying at the Omni We wandered down to the Speakeasy around 10pm and had to wait in a short line to get in since the bar can only hold so many people at a time We waited about 10 minutes and were let in I ordered a Speakeasy Scotch and my wife had a Tom Collins As we waited for our drinks I took in the ambience Its pretty cool in the Speakeasy and was a nice semiintimate place for drinks to close out the evening Got our drinks after a short wait which was forgivable since it was a busy Saturday night My Speakeasy Scotch was great and heavy on the scotch thank you and my wifes Tom Collins had pineapple in it  different than the advertised Maraschino Cherries in the menu We left after one round of drinks which turned out to be just fine I know all hotel bars are expensive but we paid more for our two drinks here than we did at Primanti Bros for our entire meal the next day There are certainly cheaper bars to drink at in the city but the Speakeasy isnt a bad choice if youre at the Omni and dont feel like venturing out into the cityI dont consider this a Speakeasy  It just seems like a bar at the bottom of a hotel  My drink was solid but the service was deplorable  I waited forever  This is the worst Speakeasy that I have ever been to"

    "review":"Weve ordered a dozen times and food is always good My absolute favorite is the Moroccan Spiced Chicken  Dry Plum Pizza It is the best pizza Ive ever had delivery or no delivery Wings and everything else is good too I wasnt a fan of some of the Greek appetizers but I think that was just my personal tasteEphesus is the best pizza in the BellevueAvalon area When my husband and I moved we were sad to be leaving our beloved pizza shop in Bloomfield Oh how I miss their delicious sauce thin crust and greasy cheese Since our move we have tried every pizza place around Though we have yet to find any pizza we love Ephesus is our goto these days The sauce is good and the crust is fairly thick and fluffy though thinner than most pizza shops Pizza is tastes and hits the spotHorrific15 lamb kebob was so overcooked that it was dehydrated jerky Imagine you dont marinate the lamb You cut it into tiny pieces and cook it well done You leave it out all night You reheat it the next evening and deliver it to us Thats how dry this lamb was The lamb came with this container of flavorless oil Am I supposed to rehydrate the lamb in this oil Argh No grilled veggie in the kebob It comes with wide steak fries frozen and deep fried and some Lovely tabouli salad Tabouli and Babaganoish: The fact that the tabouli is good just proves they know how to cook and just dont care The babaganoush was also delicious making the pizzas all the more disappointing Like YOU KNOW HOW to COOK The Turkish pizza was delicious but my husband and I both had acid tummy all night we are a family of hardcore eaters not prone to upset in the AM more in the family had acid belly I thought it was stress I ate more of the pizza Had acid upset tummy all day I adore ghost pepper and Carolina reaper infused oils so Theres a problem with this food Ive tried this place twice My friend eats here quite often and loves it so I wanted to give it another chance but both times Ive had it Its been a disappointmentWas in town and just wanted to order a pizza and my brother and his wife suggested Ephesus We ordered the a Lamb Shish kebab pizza which wasnt that great to be honest The lamb didnt taste that great and was a little bit over cooked plus really didnt see the point of not having the lamb already on the pizza Also the pizza seemed pretty bland without the lamb there wasnt any flavor to it and seemed that they really skimped on the toppings it was basically like eating a cheese pizza with a little bit of lamb I do think they have a interesting menu and I would probably try them again maybe just stay away from the kebab style pizza or maybe just get a sandwich my brother said the chicken parmesan sandwich was really good and some of the other pizza sound good Just didnt care for my first visit and it kind of upset me that they didnt honor a coupon I had for themI wanted to try something new and my grub hub took me here I want to start off and say that the food was pretty good Not bad but not the best in the entire worldWhat truly disgusts me and why this place will get a one star from me is the fact the the delivery driver had the audacity to insult me on my own property because I didnt tip him enough Aparently 15 of my bill isnt enough for this piece of trash The delivery driver told me I didnt have enough money to order food from this resturant and to never order from there again and proceeded to call me an assholeNeedless to say Ill never be ordering from this establishment again and will recommended  that nobody else do the sameI was in the mood for pizza today  ordered take out  Small Greek Gyro Pizza 1299 6 cut perfect to share but today I couldnt  I love a good gyro and was so curious about this pizza  It was cooked just right  not overdone and with each bite I got different taste every time  Ingredients include:  gyro meat tomatoes feta provolone black olives onions and white sauce  I usually would ask for light on the onions on any pizza because sometimes they can overpower the taste but the amount of ingredients was just right  I did taste a hint of garlic too on the crust which was a nice surprise  I am always in search of establishments that have different or unusual items on their menu from Mediterranean appetizers to Turkish Pizza Ephesus has that   This location is rather small only two tables in the dining area   I am looking forward to going back and trying something else"

    "review":"I usually hate reviewing nationalscale chain restaurants but this one is special Not because it is actually special but because Ive probably eaten lunch here over 300 times over 45 years The food is OK the service is OK the people are OK Its ridiculously crowded on a weekday lunch Its pretty empty at all other times Its convenient enough and passable Still I remember it fondlyThe soup is so much cheesier than I remember My gosh 1310 Gold StarsGreat place and fresh food Especially if you want a light lunch like soup and maybe a sandwich Otherwise definitely try out the mac and cheeseWent during lunch time and it was busy but the cashier was pleasant and took my order quickly and accurately The wait for food was a little bit longer than I expected 13 minutes and I couldve gone next door and gotten some Thai Iced Tea had I not have the buzzer given to me Once I received my order I briefly checked to make sure that my order was correctly filled and then left to meet a friend elsewhere since all the tables and seats were full What I was not expecting was a charred Chicken Frontega Panini  despite the busyness of a weekday I cannot believe they had the audacity to serve such inedible food though I had a togo order and the priority is to provide fast service I wouldve rather waited an extra 5 minutes for an edible Frontega chicken panini  as long as I was told otherwise Id be in the dark about the extra long wait for a measly Frontega chicken By all means the other half of the panini was great but wouldve been better had I got to enjoy the entire sandwich that I paid 8 forThis location even though it is usually very busy the staff is friendly and fast I visit this location at least three times a week and usually my experience for bagel breakfast or pick two lunch is very good  Just a few times  mainly in the weekends I have come across some not well baked bagels Truly the worst Panera Bread you will ever visit The only thing that is good here are the bagels and baked goods which Im pretty sure are the same at every Panera I have had salads here that every single leaf of lettuce inside was deadwiltedrotten One time I was actually given a sandwich that had a hole in the breadan actual hole as if someone took the middle of the bread out Bizarre The only reason this place is still in business is because they have a nice seating area and it is one of the only restaurants available on Pitts campus This location also has mice"

    "review":"Happy to be the first review at the new location  Long time fan of the Mt Lebo spot This one is much closer and every bit as good  Ate at the Lebo one last week and hit this one yesterday pizza is phenomenal  Good to see familiar faces from the other location at the one down town  Best of luck guysMargherita DOC is all you need but the rest of the menu is great tooI am very torn herethe food was a very solid 4 stars but the service was maybe 2 stars more like 15 at best and that is coming from someone who waited tables all through college so I am more than patient and understanding The only thing really going in my servers favor from last night was that our party of 6 was going to the Cabaret to see Girls Onlywhich I HIGHLY recommend by the way and he did get us out of there by 7:15 just enough time to walk over before the show Let me go into further detailOur party of 6 had 6:00pm reservations and we were seated promptly upon arrival in the upstairs area Market Square offers a valet service for I believe 7 Id highly suggest using it given the parking situation in the area Our party of six was put at what appeared to me to be a table more suitable for 4 people and we were situated right by the stairs We didnt even have enough room for the bottle of water to stay on the table once our meals arrived My mom and I were the 4th and 5th people out of our party of 6 to arrive and we were told my the other three women that they had been sitting there for at least 10 minutes without so much as a greeting from waitstaff Our 6th person arrived approximately 10 minutes after my mother and I and only then did our server I wish I could remember his nameall I remember is the distinctive tattoo on his neck and Id prefer not to identify him in that manner come over to ask if we wanted sparkling or still water We had been looking at the menus for quite some time already timeline described above and clearly wanted to order an appetizer as well as wine My moms friend started speaking and what did the server do he  interrupted her speaking and said Hold on a minute and I will be right back We were pretty floored He didnt come back in a minute however it was a full 7 minutes later And nothing against smokers because I smoked at one point too but he came back reeking of cigarettes to the point that it was pretty nastyand I rarely say that since I used to have that habit myself At that point he took our drink orders coffee 2 glasses of red and 2 of white and AGAIN my moms friend attempted to order an appetizer and he scurried off while she was speaking He took at least another 7 minutes to bring over our drinks Then we FINALLY got to hear the specials that evening At this point we were beyond ready to order to make our show so with a couple of modifications due to the specials we ordered family style and shared: the pizza special of the day which was a pancetta and fig pizza with a balsamic drizzle and zucchini flowers we had this cut into 6 so each of us could have a slice I could have eaten the entire thing myself it was VERY good the Ricotta gnudi the other special for Wednesday that came in a sage butter sauce Besides the pizza this was the next favorite item at our table the cavatelli rapini  Sausage Rapini GarlicWhite Wine Pecorino Olive Oil the pollo limone Chicken Breast Lemon White Wine Parsley Butter the PARMIGIANA MELANZANE Eggplant Fresh Mozzarella Marinara Parmigiano Basil and the VITELLO PARMIGIANO Veal Cutlet Fresh Mozzarella Marinara Spaghetti Parmigiano The cavatelli was cooked perfectly al dente per the server it was homemade pasta the sausage was spicy yet not overpowering too I only had a small piece of the pollo limone but the lemon butter sauce was quite juicy and flavorful The eggplant parm tasted as if it was fresh out of the backyard garden The sauce was perfectly seasoned with basil and the eggplant was plentiful The veal parm was very tender and I enjoyed the sauce but was not impressed with the spaghetti pasta which I do not believe was made on premises Our pizza came out very quickly as did our entrees We cleaned every plate as I said the food was excellent last night When he asked about checks he split it up 6 ways even though we said there were two couples that could be put together and then two single women He gave a check to my moms friends daughter who CLEARLY did not look an age where she would be paying her own tab Then he took FOREVER to run the credit cards throughat least 10 minutes When dining out I expect service to be on par with the price tag and this service was in no way worth the 180 price tag of the meal Although we were all disappointed in the service we received our meals were quite tasty When we were leaving we noticed other servers bringing bread to their tablesyet another thing our server failed to do which would have been quite appreciated given the lengthy wait for him to take our orders I would come back here for the food however if I received this server again I would politely ask the hosthostess for a different section to sit inTry the breaded mozzarella appetizer The mozzarella and pasta is homemade in house daily You will be ruined for mozzarella sticks after this Both my meal and my boyfriends were amazing We are from Chicago and therefore pretty picky about Italian food and this place is an A Outstanding food and service Brett was incredibly helpful with my dietary restrictions and provided excellent serviceThis has become one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh  Its perfect for group outings special occasions or just grabbing a bite to eat late at night  It has a casual rustic feel to it with solid wood tables subway tile behind the upstairs bar and of course the beautiful wood burning ovenThe food is by far the star here  The calamari is fresh crispy and just delicious  The woodfired pizzas have that delicious sweet dough that is so well known and loved from the caramelization process created in the intense heat of the wood fired oven  The toppings are exquisite  Unfortunately that did recently take their Burata pizza off the menu  The Burata cheese would melt on the pizza creating a pseudo cheesy cream sauce that was out of this world  I think Im drooling  Dont worry though  The Burata pizza may be no more but any of the others are also delicious  The prosciutto makes the stuff you get at the average store look like shoe leather  Its salty tender and melts in your mouth  Oh and the pizza is not the only star at this place  The pasta is OMG good as well  At my recent visit I had the gnocchi which were light delicious pillows of goodness in your mouth  Yep Im definitely drooling :If youre looking for a tasty beverage to enjoy with your meal have no fear  They have all sorts of Italian imported beers various beers on tap and bottled craft beers  Try the Anchorsteam beer because what is better in this world than a good beer with an even better pizzaThe service is also something to tout about at this place  During my most recent visits Brian was our server and did an outstanding job  Have a question about a cheese an Italian meat or a beer  He knows the answer and will help you find something youll enjoy  His expertise definitely made the hard decision of what to order much easierOverall I will be here again and againAfter walking around the Pittsburgh downtown for a while we decided to get some Italian food A good cozy crowded place in the Market Square Great service I ordered the meatless Gnocci which was delicious My husband did not like his food so much Loved their TiramisuI just messaged a friend telling her that weve got to go back next week We had dinner at il PIzzaiolo around Christmastime and it was incredibleI think we wore our server out asking for more freshed baked bread I had the eggplant and it was absolutely fantastic and to top it off for dessert: sfogliatelle Just like nonni used to make"

    "review":"Im a little surprised at the low rating honestly I had a lot worse food than this in Pittsburgh id say this deserves at least a 35 based on the food quality alone ok the service staff is a little incompetent but come on the food was good  and for a grab and go food place to me the food outweighs the service I really liked their soup I had the chicken wild rice didnt at all expect to be impressed but I was and the rosemary bagle bites that came with the soup are delicious too Bagle was good too will be back for sureThe remodel is nice but think twice if you are in a hurry  Very slow The layout between the juice bar and food area is a bit confusing  Staff is friendlyFound this gem on my trip to Pittsburgh Really good bagel place and awesome coffeeVisiting Pittsburgh for work so we decided to stop here for breakfast  We beat the rush I ordered two sausage egg and cheese bagels on wheat and a wheat bagel It was satisfying Hot fresh and fast Everything you want in a breakfast meal I didnt order the coffee so I cant help you there Just a heads up it does seem to get busy but the line moves fastNice convenient coffee and sandwich shop The food is good and prices are reasonable Staff is friendly Only draw back is it gets pretty crowded at lunch so lines can be longThe bagels and sandwich we had were good  The menu was a little confusing The service was quick and the prices were reasonable"

    "review":"Great food sadly terrible service when theyre busy Tried to call and place an order three times just now An unhappy lady answered the third time I waited 5 minutes in between calls I started with my order and asked for no onions which I dont feel is an odd request She said when theyre busy no special requests are taken but shed check I could hear her in the background asking the chef if he could do no onions in an order and I could hear him in the background saying well I guess so in a nasty why are you being a bother tone At that point I can do without my order Ill go to another one of the great pittsburgh breakfast spots where they dont mind answering their phone or making their customer the order they want It will be a long time until I go back here and definitely wont be when theyre busyI can only rate this a three not based off of their good which was excellent but because of their lack of customer service The place is small which adds to the old school diner feel but the servers act as if they have no time for anyone but the regulars It was my first time eating here new to the Greentree area and not a single server they all help cover each others tables which is a plus even said Hi or how are you guys doing today The first simply set silverware down and without looking at either myself or my husband uttered your server will grab your drinks and walked away Almost ten minutes later our server walks up and had my husband not been looking up since I was buried in the menu neither of us wouldve noticed her standing there since she didnt greet us She takes our drink requests without a smile or any additional interaction and walks away Our order for food followed soon after but our simple breakfast took over 30 minutes to  arrive the saving grace of the experience was the delicious onion  green pepper potatoes The bacon quality was great but it tasted like burnt and dirty griddle which just shows poor training in the kitchen or lack of awareness However I love the diner atmosphere so I will continue to go back and hope it can only improveWe arrived after lunch rush and had a great meal The omelets were expertly made fluffy area fantastic fillings and cheese I loved the hash browns too crispy tasty patties The pancakeswe got blueberry and banana walnut The banana walnut were fantastic  Large chunks of walnuts and yum bananas Breakfast burrito was delish too The service Fast and awesome Refills kept coming And our waitress was great I got my omelet and it had homefries I noted I ordered hash browns she said ok quickly no arguing with me and promptly ran and got me hashbrowns She didnt take my plate away like so many restaurants do and make me sit there with no food She didnt take the homefries away either which always strikes me as petty at restaurants when an order is wronf I was a restaurant manager who didnt like that practice as you cant serve that food again once it gas hit the table and its yacky Super professional service and made us really happyIn town for my first Steelers game this place was great Awesome and friendly service great coffee and you cant beat the prices I had their almost famous breakfast sandwich and got a choice of sweet or hot sausage The hot was nicely spicy and delicious Classic diner feel huge portions When  Im town Ill definitely stop againMy wife and I have loved this place ever since we moved to Crafton over 5 years ago It is the picture of a greasy spoon diner Counter and table service Big portions and decent prices The waitresses have always been friendly and the ownercook is nice as well This place gets packed on the weekends so be prepared to wait a little while at the door but its worth it The Omelettes and Big Breakfast Burrito seem to be favorites of all the customers as well as myself The home fried potatoes are a must side for any breakfastI forgot to write a review for here  Just throwing a quick one outThis food here was amazing and cheap Ordered a huge meaty omelette and some home fries for around 7 w a coffee Negative: The place is tiny and was jam packed not one seat open except at the counter behind the cooks Was interesting watching their fast pace though and realizing although I love to cook I could never handle working a position like that Nonstop bam bam bam pushing food out Very loud inside If you are claustrophobic go eat in your car lol My anxiety level was above average til I received my food and blocked everyone out while enjoying it"

    "review":"Ive been to Bados a few times now mainly to try there nice selection of craft beers but this time I actually tried there pizza for lunch Me and a friend ordered an eight cut Florentine Pizza pizza with out diced tomatoes and it was delicious Only thing that was disappointing is our pizza was suppose to have Sicilian crust and it came out with regular instead We ended up keeping the pizza but they did offer to replace it but due to time constraints we could t wait Overall the pizza was excellent I would like to see how it tasted with the actual Sicilian crustSo far Ive had the Mexican pizza Jalapeo burger  Philly Steak pizza The burger was excellent so were the fries My husbands Philly pizza was amazingly good I want moreThe Mexican pizza was okay Not terrible just had too much on it and was sloppy They always have a full house There is no where to wait for your tableSo I had a gift certificate from a local radio station to Bados so I checked it out I want around seven on a Monday night also Columbus Day if that has any impact and there was really no crowd  My server Barry was very nice and was very goodRight off the bat Ill explain why am taking two stars away The service was a little bit too fast for me between my two courses as within maybe three minutes of my salad being taken away my pizza came right out Normally Im a fan of fast service but that was a little bit too fast for me Im also taking a star off and whoever reads this review will probably think this is a stupid reason but this review is my opinion because the salads with the exception of a few or overpriced compared to the other appetizersI had the grilled portobello mushroom salad and the 4 cut margherita pizza The salad was huge but great the house Italian dressing complemented the salad really well The salad was a nice mix of mushroom and greens though Id have preferred a bigger helping of greens Of course youre not going to like this salad if you dont like mushrooms The pizza was tasty and pretty well done Oh my goodness was it tasty You could really taste the tomatoes and basil playing off each other and neither was overpowered by the cheese Secondly the tomatoes tasted fresh not like the canned heavily processed kind or tomato paste but like the diced San Marzanno organic tomatoes you can buy at fancier grocery stores That went a long way for me with the pizza The con for the pizza: I have to say it was weird to me that the crust was this weird mix of crispy and kind of hard to cut and then perfectly chewy The actual bottom of the pizza was crispy like it should be so the pizza doesnt fall apart but it was a little too crispy for my tastes as there were a couple points where I had a hard time cutting the pizza into bitesize pieces I also have to comment that two of my slices the two that I ended up bringing home because I was stuffed hadnt been fully cut apart and that was a little annoying I can overlook it but its still something I want to comment onThis isnt the kind of pizza that you can easily just pick up and eat with your hands because there is so much to it Its a very dense pizza I want to end this review by commenting on the slightly weird pricing for the pizzas The pizza is priced based off of how many slices the pizza is cut into And I feel the pizza was a little bit pricey for the four slice pizza that I got it was just under 13 That all said though I had a fun time at Bados and Ill go backLove Bados Any pizza is really good and their rueben is very tasty Lots of beer choices and they give out free samplesgot the buffet pizza was good they also give you free soup to Bados easily ranks in my top 5 favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh Their pizza sauce carries a subtle sweetness that makes it unique to most other places in town and their nonpizza cuisine is decent as well The atmosphere is nice The service is friendly and almost always good The restaurant does fill up quickly on most nights making it difficult to get in and get out They have a great beer selection though the bar area is small and easily overcrowdsThe only major negative is that when you order the potato skins they hide the sour cream underneath the cheese so it cant be seen until its too late This can be quite a shock for those who prefer their skins condimentless"

    "review":"This place just didnt impress me By no means was I expecting fine dining but I wasnt expecting downright horrible food either My cheeseburger was so bad that I didnt even bring the leftovers home for my dog The meat was like rubber and the patties were so small you had to hunt to find them My daughter had the chicken fingers and they were definitely a frozen product because they were chewy The service was just terrible They had 15 empty tables when we arrived and they couldnt find a place to put a party of 6 and made us wait Our server was sweet but she was definitely overworked and had too many tables at once to wait on I feel bad for the staff as you can just tell they arent treated well They are overworked and underpaid Our dishes werent cleared and we had to wait 15 minutes for our check My daughter loved the free cookie and loved the coloring paper they provide but that was the only positiveYes I know this is not 50 meal place and waiters probably not making huge amount of tips but its not an excuse to be rude on the phone every time I call to place take out order and yes I always leave tip for take out orderCalled today at 10:59 to place an order for 11:30: sorry you would have to call back at 11:15Because apparently if I have to pick up order at 11:30 they have to put it in at 11:15 but its only 10:59 and they will forget Called second time at 11:15 The lady on the phone asked my name I told her it will be for Rachel my daughter The lady asked me again is it your name Rachel you surely does not sound like Rachel What that supposed to mean Because I have an accent my name can not be Rachel Rude My daughter went to pick up my burgerit was cold Asked for swiss cheesegot American cheese So here it is2 stars Will never order from eat n park againThis  Eat n Park  location is pretty good  What I really like about this place is that it essentially the zone 4 police stations real HQ  Go to the station house and there might be a disinterested officer behind the desk  Instead just head over to the eat n park on Murray  No doubt youll find at least four officers especially in the morningYoull be able to feel quite safe while you enjoy your smiley waffleThe Eatn Park in my neighborhood  which I visited over Thanksgiving break  is large and bright open 247 and boasts a soup and salad bar an elaborate Sunday brunch a midnight buffet and a colorful laminated menu with more than 150 choices I decided to pop into my local Eatn Park over break with three friends from home all of whom had also grown up on Smiley Cookies  We were seated and greeted quickly by an extremely personable waitress  After chatting for a few minutes we ordered  the food arrived less than 10 minutes later  Before it did however we sampled the large salad bar just 3 on top of a meal  Although it did not live up to its usual standards no spinach or romaine offered it was still a delicious first courseOur meals were also quite good  Eatn Park prides itself at purchasing all of its dairy and meat products locally  this was quite evident  One friend ordered a chicken sandwich while the other got a large cheeseburger both they said were excellent  I got two large whole grain blueberry pancakes  And because Eatn Park is the Place for Smiles my flapjacks were topped with a powdered sugar grin  The pancakes were thick with warm blueberrygoodness  hardly in need of the large bowl of maple syrup they arrived withAfter the meal my friends and I stayed to chat for more than an hour  This was no problem for our waitress who continually returned to make chitchat and refill our water  By the time we left we were not only sated by our food but by the wonderful Pittsburgh establishment we just visitedAnd of course we got a few Smiley Cookies for the road  I can assure you they are as good today as they were when my grandmother bought them for me a decade and a half ago  Nothing beats ending your meal with a Smile Rating: Dont MissPrice:  68 dollars per lunch entreeI guess its typical greasy diner food and I mightve been expecting a little bit more like IHOP The concept was cute with all the smiles and the service was great Our waiter was super friendly and attentive but the food was just lacking a lot for me I think this is definitely more of a spot for drunk college kids on the weekends and I probably wouldnt come back I think Id rather pick up WendysIts okay Doesnt have food thatll blow you out of the water but its not bad grub either Its your standard diner fare with sandwiches pies cakes milkshakes salads and the works The one nice thing they do have is the Midnight Breakfast Buffet which might be worth considering if youre really a fan of eating loads of breakfast food However its not really enough to offset giving it any higher of a rating"

    "review":"Coco Cafe now serves dinner a few nights a week starting on Thursday  Last night I had one of the best meals I had in a long time portions and price points are just right  Food had plenty of nice flavors and texturespresentation deliciously appealing  I had the scallops and with farro risotto it was OMG  awesome  I also got a bite of the red snapper as well as the chicken served with cornmeal wafflesThe menu had many choices and it was hard to pick I will be back Finally a nice place for very delicious inspired food without killing your pocketbookThis is a great little restaurantcafe in the heart of Lawrencville I brought my mom and stepdad here from VA Beach and they really enjoyed themselves The food is great and their ingredient combinations are uncommon and surprisingly tasty The wait staff is friendly and the ambiance has an artsy vibe to it My only complaint is that they dont offer more healthy food itemsoptions on their menu The food is definitely fresh however the calorie content is highIm torn on what to write here First off Id like to say that I generally prefer to rate restaurants based on the quality of the food only and not service atmosphere etc The food here is indeed very good Ive been here for breakfast brunch lunch and dinner tapas Id say the breakfast and brunch werent as exceptional You get a good omelet sure but in the end of the day its just an omelet The lunch is great Im not a big fan of sandwiches but I generally enjoy their sandwiches way more than other places That said there arent many options other than sandwiches which is something Id really like to see Finally the tapas they have for dinner are hands down greatHonestly I would give this establishment a 5 star review if it were not for the pretty lousy service and sometimes outright attitude you get hereThe shrimp and grits are quite possibly the best Ive had north of the south and I know southern born and raised in tennesseegeorgiasouth carolinamississippi Definitely give them a shot I have yet to have a bad meal from here and the people working here are the bombAvocado and bacon omelette was great perfect portion size Good espresso drinks and loved the options for almond milk and gluten free bread The long wait at 3pm on a Saturday was kinda surprising and the lack of waiting space indoor kinda sucked but only because it was freezing outsideHighly underrated for dinner They put a lot of thought into the dishes which change frequently The food is excellent and diverse but it is more tapas style than anything Ill stress that some of the dishes miss the mark but your server will be happy to help guide you  Have only been here once for breakfast but it was phenomenal Expect long wait times on the weekend for breakfast A little pricey but its BYOB so that adds to the value of the equation Excellent service however the wait times arent always amazing because of how small the kitchen is Will definitely be coming back perfect for a nice long unAmerican style dinner"

    "review":"I remember going here a long time ago and not really seeing anything that vaguely resembled Thai food on the menu  Still I remember the ruby quail being really good stuff  A whole fried quail in this tasty red sauce and surrounded by vegetablesThai fried rice was okay  Nothing special with that dish  Perhaps try the coconut curry insteadWas disappointed with this place Thought pad thai was pretty standard but it lacked flavor here It was pretty spicy but not that enjoyable However the spring rolls were pretty good and I enjoyed the Thai iced tea The service was alright and the environment was nice and friendly but I dont think I will make it my staple thai placeI had high hopes for dinner here when I walked in its such a nice looking place with lots of extra seating in the back and was fairly quiet on a Wednesday evening meaning I could comfortably talk to my friends without having to shout Always a plusBut things overall went downhill quickly once I sat down and my group began ordering The service was pretty bad especially considering that our group was one of three or four tables total that even had people sitting at them Examples of what I mean by Pretty bad: no one ever checked on our water and only refilled our drinks if we waved them down and specifically asked for them to do so and even grabbing a waitress to ASK for the refill was tough because again they never came by the table to check on us and a couple of us actually had to ask for green tea repeatedly from TWO waitresses before one of them brought that out The tea itself tasted really weak and did not impress meAs for the food: a friend reported that their food was not as spicy as he thought it would be and he asked for it at level 10 So I guess spicy means mild at this place I personally ordered the Mongolian beef which I thought was fairly good the pineapple in it was a nice touch while it wasnt an outstanding dish it was still very enjoyable But while my main course tasted lovely the spring roll I ordered or rather the sauce that came with it was horrendous I forget what kind of sauce it was but it tasted nasty and made the roll unbearable I used my main dishs sauce for dipping insteadI didnt even bother with dessert in Shadyside theres plenty of other options and Id had enough disappointment for one meal Really thats the best word to describe this place: not terrible but disappointing overall And from what I could see during my meal here Thai Place Restaurant is about unique and flavorful as its nameYa  never know what you will get at the Thai Place I have had some great lunches with good service and horrible service with the wrong meal served before Its a crap shoot at best Their service will go to hell if more than 5 couples come in which makes it tough to frequent I do like the Pad so it gets some reps Take your chancesUnremarkable Thai food Its not bad its nothing to phone home about either Prices are decent the location is convenient and the service is friendlyIf youre looking for really good Thai food though try Nickys Smiling Banana Leaf or either of the Thai spots in Bloomfield"

    "review":"Stopped in for dinner this Friday evening The restaurant was busy as there was a nhl playoff game on Upon arriving we waited for two hostesses to finish their conversation before noticing us We were told or more accurately shown with a waving hand that the bar area was open seating After sitting at a table we watched 15 minutes of the game before being approached by a server The wine my girlfriend ordered was not available due to an upcoming menu update I ordered a domestic draft Another 1015 minutes passed and the server came back to inform me they were out if the beer We then ordered our food My girlfriend got a strawberry salad which was fine I ordered the chicken spiedini and was told they were also out of this due to the menu update The server quickly offered to actually check the availability of the item and I offered a back up selection  The dish was well prepared when I received itThroughout the evening we experienced 2030 minute gaps between our server stopping at the table The only factor which made this passable was the game on the tvs Overall the food was good when we did eventually receive it but the overall experience was horrid Our server was very nice and helpful but she appeared to be the only server working a crowded bar area during a home team championship game on a beautiful Friday evening If the restaurant is planning a menu change they may want to transition their meals more efficiently to avoid large amounts of the current menu not being availableThe preparedness of having one of the most popular domestic drafts out of stock 10 minutes into a game night is laughable as well Simply one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have ever had the only positive was our servers ability to remain upbeat despite the hurdles she was forced to overcomeTheres a reason that the other local Walnut Grills have closed and based on my recent experience I firmly believe this one is on the fasttrack to follow suit  First it must be disclosed that on Mothers Day 2016 our party of six did not have a reservation  With that said our decision to visit the Walnut Grill was based upon an earlier phone call which confirmed the wait would be no more than one hour  This was acceptable given the circumstances and would give our party a chance to meet at the bar for cocktails anyway  Upon arrival to a neardeadempty restaurant we were advised by the hostess that the wait would be 3 hours unless we wanted to eat outside  We saw that the patio also empty as it was 60 degrees and falling was equipped with heat lamps so we opted to sit outside  The hostess advised that we could simply let her know when we were ready to be seated after our cocktails at the bar which we did approximately 30 minutes later  The hostess then led us to a table on a different patio at the opposite side of the building near the front parking lot  This patio offered no space heaters  Despite these setbacks we decided to stick it out and make the best of the situation after all we made it to a table at a restaurant on Mothers Day without reservations  Its worth mentioning that we could see countless tables inside the restaurant that remained vacant throughout the duration of our visit  After a brief wait our waitress arrived with menus  We spent about 15 minutes perusing the special Mothers Day Menu which is different and dissimilar to the traditional Walnut Grill menu  The waitress arrived and took our orders: 2 cedarplanked salmon and 4 NY strip steaks  Approximately 20 minutes later the waitress returned with a basket of bread which she set on the table and again disappeared  We had no place settings or plates so we were forced to wait for her return to ask for these items  When we did she brought 4 plates and 2 place settings while at the same time advising us that the kitchen had run out of NY strip steaks  Disappointed we all chose the nextmost similar but more expensive menu item the filet  The waitress disappeared again this time for around 45 minutes  When she finally reemerged we politely asked how much longer we could expect to wait especially for the soup that was ordered over 1 hour ago  She lazily advised that the wait would be at least 20 more minutes and that the soup for some bizarre unknown reason would arrive with the entrees  How she came up with the 20 minute estimation is anyones guess  At this point we decided to reevaluate our options and considered leaving but believed we were close enough to the finish line that we opted to stay  20 more long minutes later our meals finally arrived which in this case one would think would be a blessing  I can only speak to the quality of my own meal but will attest that nobody appeared overly excited about the food on their plates  Unfortunately my filet was cooked medium as was the preference when the original NY strip steak was ordered my fault I guess for not respecifying but nonetheless it was a bland slab of meat  Nothing special about the baked potato or garden slaw  Word about our tables long wait and unrest must have made its way to the restaurants manager as he arrived at our table to offer an apology and a price reduction on our bill a nice gesture for which most of us were appreciative but which was too little too late  This restaurant is a total mess from the awkward separationist floorplan to the bartenders avoidanceofeye contact policy to the trashstrewn restrooms just an overall pretty terrible experience  Not sure how long this place can last in its state of mismanagement  The waitress who served us was unacceptably untrained which is a disappointment at a restaurant asking 2638 per entre  In my opinion Walnut Grill has attemped to position itself as an upmarket restaurant without first taking care of the small details that are to be expected of comparable restaurants  No place of business can operate in the manner which the Walnut Grill does and expect to stay in business long I predict this restaurant will be closed in the very near if not immediate future  Will not go backJust left after waiting 20 minutes for our waitress to return and take our order  Went to front desk to complain but they seemed not too concerned that we were leaving  Have been to this restaurant for dinner at least twice a month in the last year and always enjoyed food and good service  That will change as there are plenty of good restaurants that value a customers time  I will now go to the Walnut Grill once every 3 months  Why patronize a restaurant that must not care about good serviceThis was my second visit to Walnut Grill but my Sisters first go I got us a bottle of Italian Riesling to share FYI  Wednesdays are half off bottles of wine and started out with sharing the large Greek salad  very fresh  great dressing Dinners ordered were the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp  chicken spiedini   both were fab We ended our meal with their vanilla creme brle which is one of my personal favs A big shoutout to our server Rachel who was awesome  Ill absolutely request to be seated in her section on my next visitWorst brunch in Pittsburgh The baked eggs looked and tasted like a fisher price kids kitchen toy No one should feel comfortable serving something like that The waitstaff was friendly though and kept the breakfast drinks flowing so thats a plus I guessThe place was dead as expected on a Sunday afternoon So youd think the service would be great But not the case We had to tell the hostess twice that we needed our waitressWaitress returned 15 minutes later We were told she was taking another tables orderWe did finally order But waitress never came back to refill our drinks We had to ask the server when our food came Everyones plates had obviously say on a warmer for awhile since the plates were very hotMy flatbread came out way over cooked around the edges and gooey in the middlePretty disappointed with the experience and will not be back Funny that my in laws said that this location was better than the one in Mt Lebanon Im glad we didnt go THERE"

    "review":"I came here with a group of about twenty people for lunch on a weekend There kitchen is in the back and you can see everything theyre doing which is pretty cool The area by the door is more for carry out theres a couple tables Inside though theres a lot more seating The restaurant area is roomy and although its not fancy its homey The owner and employees also really contribute to this feel I got the impression that the owner knew everyone who walked in and customers made it a point to say goodbye to everyone working there on their way out There was also a mixup in our group about when we would eat but the owner was extremely patient and accommodatingWe only ordered pizza so I cant speak for the Greek items on the menu that theyre named for Big Fat Greek I did hear they have good gyros though and their prices seem pretty low for everythingI watched them roll out preportioned bags of pizza dough and add sauce cheese and toppings The pizza was served hot and delicious Their pizza sauce has no sweet taste like others Ive tried in the area The pizza overall was good but not particularly spectacular I did really enjoy the crust thoughit was crispy on the outside including the part under the sauce and cheese which is often soggy and soft almost too soft and doughy insideAlthough this place is a little out of my way if Im ever in the area Ill definitely try other items from their menuHighly recommended Gyros are unbelievable and for the price you cant beat it Definitely will be back frequently The owner is the man go check him outIm not from the area and I wasnt sure about this place But I have to tell you BEST FOOD Ive had in Pitts I ordered the quarter pound hot dog the burger and grilled cheese bits and a sangria The meal was fantastic and our server was wonderful we also sat on the top balcony that viewed the street and it was really nice Im going to be a regular here when I visit Pittsburgh againDelicious stuffed grape leaves and really friendly service The falafel sandwich was so big and stuffed with fresh chopped veggies Sauces and hummus were tasty as well Nice Rolling Stones painting : A great deal total for a lunch for two at under 1500While my daughter was in Childrens Home the nurses recommended coming across the street to try the food at Big Fat Greek BFG Caf The environment is very pleasant and welcoming you can see them at work cooking behind the counters and the owner John is actually from Greece and hes really very nice Their gyros are the best Ive ever had in my life theyre stuffed so full that theyre huge I cant believe that theyre only 5 The homemade tzatziki is definitely out of this world The prices there are very affordable and the food is absolutely phenomenal Was so excited to bring my fianc here for my second visit and found out that he loved it a lot too My fianc and I will definitely be coming here again :This is an East End secret Great pizza perhaps the best gyro in the Burgh and John the owner is awesome A good man he lives right in Garfield and is an old school neighborhood cat We get our food here regularly and you just cant beat the price and quality I mean 2 pizzas and 45 toppings for 20 And great service GO HERE"

    "review":"Restaurant has So much characterBasically they put store bought salsa on everything The staff was rude and they are super cheap with their drinks and chipssalsa Maybe Im just used to the great service and food at Emilianos The food looked like a bunch of slop and when someone at my table asked for double meat on their tacos they were rude and said no because the meat is already portioned out Ok So you dont want extra money for extra meat WeirdMy family decided to try this little restaurant after driving past it so many times  We heard mixed reviews about it and wanted to see for ourselves  The numerous signs made it very clear that only the first basket of chips was free and drinks only came with one refill  The food itself wasnt great  I got a chicken taco and burrito that came with rice and beans  The taco and burrito were bland and seemed thrown together The rice was hard and painfully bland while the beans were soggy and seemed to be watery  There are many better options for good Mexican food  The food here just isnt worth itI love this place Ive had several items off the menu and Im always pleased Its an excellent option if you want take out on a Friday night and I think its also a BYOB The al pastor tacos are the best Make sure you order a side of hot sauce to go with your meal Its definitely a better option than any of the local pizza places for take outVery authentic mexican food The service is always great and fast I have been there numerous times and I have yet to have a bad experience The portions are huge and the food is amazingFood took a very long time to arrive and tasted like it was straight out of a can or jar  Maybe they had trouble finding the can opener  The colorful decor and low prices are the only things this place has going for it"

    "review":"Service is a bit autistic But the sandwiches are amazing The wait is always stupid long but thats part of it I guessCame for dinner around 530pm on Thursday night and we were one of the first parties there before the big craze It really fills up around 6pm and the line gets backed up Bf and I ordered the sampler plate and a cauliflower and avocado salad and 2 steak empanadas Our bill was around 70 and the food was pretty delicious The sauce options were great but you couldnt really taste one from the otherWhat an experience The food the atmosphere the courteous staff  you cant beat this restaurant The pulled pork and corn pudding were outstanding I highly recommend trying this restaurant You will not be disappointedUnlike the other reviews we were very lucky and had no wait The food was fantastic  Thank goodness the staff was extremely helpful in what to order because the menu was a little tough to choose from with a line of people behind you I suggest checking the menu before you arrive and have some order while you grab a tableI came here after walking around the Strip on a weekday afternoon with a friend After some Yelping it seemed like this was the place to be  Ive rarely seen so many 5 star reviews before and when I arrived this was around 1:30PM there was a line outside the door The place  the restaurant is bigger than it looks on the outside when you first enter you wait inline and place your order at the counter You then grab a seat and the food will be brought out to you The interior feels very hipsterchic  theres a giant chalkboard menu lots of solid wood furnishings high ceilings mason jars iron embellishments its well lit and pleasant The food I went with the rosemary beef sandwich DELICIOUS The ciabatta bread was nicely toasted and the beef was savory flavorful and decadent There was a LOT of meat so I wouldnt recommend it if you are an office worker looking to avoid an afternoon food coma That said the meat got a little drier towards the end of the sandwich This is where the sauces came in handy There are four restaurantmade sauces available for everyone by the cutlery I sampled all four and they were great sandwich condiments The service fantastic Everyone had a smile on their faces and eager to help The woman who brought out our sandwiches went out of her way to introduce us to the sauces and explain Overall it was a great experience I put four instead of five stars just because I wasnt as mindblown by the sandwich as I thought I would be  but overall I would definitely come backA friend and I stop down for a Saturday lunch the wait was a little long 30min the line was out the door however the food was excellent I will definitely go again the sandwich was on thick sour dough bread and they were very generous with the meat portions Fantastic Argentinian food"

    "review":"Love the staff and LOVE the thai pad  YummyThe soup and roll were really good I ordered spicy thai fired rice on lunch with level 5 spice and it wasnt that good Most of my colleagues ordered curry fried rice and pineapple fired rice so I think those must be the popular dishesThe place is definitely a good option for the priceThe negative reviews surprised meI go here fairly often and my only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep They have great green curry mango curry and their pad Thai is also quite good Many people order food to pick up so the place is never crowded Its a relaxed atmosphere with attentive friendly serviceAwesome food every time Staff is great Wish wasnt so pricy or I would go there much more for togoOverpriced poor ingredients americanized thai food  Food was worthy of two stars but the ownerattendants Seinfeldesque rudeness lowers their rating to one star  Not worth visiting despite its monopoly on Thai food in the areaI havent been here in a long time So I thought Id give it a try Pop entering there were two people in the restaurant and it was 630 on a Friday night I shouldve known better So we all ordered the pad Thai One person got the curry and liked itI ordered the pad Thai on a spice level number eight and it was not anything special The only difference between spicy or not spicy with how much extra hot red pepper flakes they would sprinkle on top of the pad ThaiThe service was absolutely terrible The waitress just was too young and inexperiencedWould not go back anytime soon"

    "review":"I didnt want to like this place largely because its owned by Eat n Park and you know    Eat n Park but its actually a great spot for a date or a work lunch The lighting inside is a bit garish for my taste but the environment is cool in both senses of the word modern and comfortable  Come here for the pizza but stay for the pizza  If you love thin crispy adult pizza this is the spot  The rest of the menu is serviceable but uninspired  The harvest salad with mushroom walnut and goat cheese could use something more to separate it from typical saladbar fareother than the goat cheese  That saidthe pizza  Theres always the pizzaGood food especially pizza Go for happy hour as it is pricey Also go in the summer when the windows open upSmall menu but usually very good have mostly had the pizzas or roast beef sandwichnice in the summer when the doors are open Brunch is even better Get the corn breadOne of the few really great restaurants in Pittsburgh that wont break the bank and that I suggest to the Mrs when we are looking to eat out  I have eaten here three time and grabbed a takeout for the fourth  My wife has eaten here two times  Weve had a good service that was relatively fast attentive and knowledgeable  The wait for seating has not been an issue but choose your times well for example early evening weekend dinners might be a little crowded  The noise level can be a bit high at times but what can you doNow onto the most important part of the review the FOODWe have had the personal pizzas amazing the Prime Rib sandwich and Winter salad  Their appetizers are great as well  Ive taken family to eat her and they all loved it as well Cant wait to go back againI cant speak about the recent controversy surrounding the E coli outbreak at the Porch in Oakland http:wwwpostgazettecomlocalcity20131030Ecolisickens5atPorchatSchenleyinOaklandstories201310300132 but my experiences here have always been pretty good Ive eaten a meal here once where I felt that the food was very good but a bit overpriced  and also had a few happy hours at the bar The service for food has always been a bit below par but you can avoid some of that craziness if you go the bar The bartenders are younger and typically nice chatty and helpful Im surprised that a restaurant this upscale can do good business in this part of Oakland where students typically look for a quick and cheap meal However this probably caters to the professionals in the area and I think this place fits a nice niche in the neighborhood Only time will tell if they can make it after this E coli business and a lack of clientele from cheap college students I wish it well and will probably be back at some point7 bucks for beer on tap I thought I came here for a happy hour at around 4 no judgements I was with my boss and we discovered that happy hour didnt start until 4:30 The bartender who wasnt even very nice or chatty while we were pretty much the only people there wouldnt even consider giving us the happy hour special and the bill was 14 bucks for 2 beers I will probably not stop in again any time soon"

    "review":"The food was decent and the servers were attentive Im lowering the rating because for the price I dont think it was quite worth it  Ive had better food or certainly comparable food for much less money at other fine Pittsburgh establishments Habitat also felt a little snooty to me  I probably wont be back for another 120 two person meal anytime soon I had the halibut and while it was fine I didnt love the way they prepared itFrom start to finish our experience here was excellent The host was extremely friendly our server was fantastic and the food was fantastic A bit pricey and portions can be a bit small but the quality and taste was well worth itThis place is a solid 35 stars  The presentment of the food is fantastic here and prices are reasonable considering it is a more gourmet establishment  I had the spinach and arugula salad which was excellent  I also ordered the filet  It was under cooked but quite a tasty piece of meat  Also I couldnt get over the wine prices as they were very cheap  We had a Malbec it was only 24 and tasted greatWill definitely be coming backNot bad not bad at all but not that great either  I went here for lunch with a friend and had the grilled vegetable wrap with sweet potato fries  When I read grilled veggies I want a variety of grilled veggies  and I like them grilled  you know have those little charcoal lines on them  Well that wasnt the case for Habitats version of grilled veggie wrap  It was your usual suspect veggies  eggplant a bit chewy and hard red peppers and some leafy greens that were doused in the dressing they put on there  That was probably the saving grace  the doused dressing it helped to cover up the lack of grilled veggie taste  But I was in the mood for veggies and this sorta hit the spot  The sweet potato fries were goodmaybe that was the meals saving grace  The desserts looked really good at this place but we didnt have the time nor the space to try them out  Service was greatBest steak of my life Hands down Great menu and excellent food Our service was amazingHigh quality ingredients and our food was made with prideExcellent food though the menu is small I love that they serve so much organic and local fare They even created a very nice vegetarian dish for my Mom and she was pleasantly surprised Nice ambiance for a quiet dinner good looking waiter was a bonus The night manager Gerry was very generous and took meticulous care of our table"

    "review":"Went there for a dinner date a few months ago   My dining companion and I both got food poisoning   Neither of us were surprised  The food handling left much to be desiredAll the previous reviews on here are for dining what about the hotel I stayed 2 nights a Sunday and Monday Nice hotel It is a grand  old mansion built circa 1886 and designated an historic landmark Definitely an old school hotel there is internet and basic TV rooms are spotless and quiet and speckless The place  has a certain charm to it If you like your hotel to be quiet quaint and a little quirky this is the place to stay Located next to Carnegie Mellon University and within walking distance of the University of Pittsburgh The surrounding neighbourhood is filled with similar old well kept mansions from 1880s and makes for pleasant walking I will return to this hotel on my next trip to Pittsburgh Would have been 5 stars if I had my own coffee maker in the room but the staff is always ready to being you a carafe for no charge I just prefer to wake up and not have to dress to go for my first coffeeI liked the ambience better than the food  I went there for the first time today for Sunday brunch 22 per person prix fixe  The dining room is quite elegant as is the library in which the buffet is set out  The ambience suggests that the year is 1900  The waiter was very good but they seemed to be understaffedThe yogurt with fruit the warm brie with strawberry the hummus and toast the chicken the cinnamon pastry triangles and the tiny eclairs were all quite good  The quiche was cold tiny and not particularly flavorful  Orange juice was served in dainty little glasses causing anyone with a good thirst to order at least two  The wait for the entrees was excessive  about 25 minutes from the time we ordered them  I got french toast and my kids got strawberry pancakes  Both were dry and unremarkable  Ive cooked better french toast and pancakes at home in my opinion  We didnt try the sandwiches or salads perhaps theyre betterOverall its not a bad place but I think you can do better  Another elegant place for lunch or brunch but better food is Frick CafeNote: according to their own web page http:wwwsunnyledgecom the name of this place is Sunnyledge Boutique Hotel  Tea Room  Historic is not part of the nameWho deleted my review of SunnyledgeBack in April I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge  We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu  When we arrived there however it was a different story  We were met at the door by the hostess I presume who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were thereWe shrugged it off and went to the bar  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants  And thats saying somethingThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen  Even when it came time to get our check it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my cardTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place  I have no plans on returningI hope this isnt deleted again and if it is I will make sure its well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper  I have the means I have the willI only go here for the martinis Ive never had the food The bar is an excellent cozy place that works for couples and groups There is an assortment of nontraditional martinis The prices are extremely reasonable8 for a very generous martini and the staff is excellent The only sad thing is they have Hendricks gin but never any cucumbers The nice thing about martinis here is that they fill your glass and then give you a mini carafe of more martini in a round bowl full of ice to keep it coldFor the barWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching They no longer do easter brunch but they do have their martini bar  which many people seem to rave about I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday eveningJust getting off work I came alone The location is a historical landmark a mansion built in 1889 and is the reason they deserve their single star The mansion from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass The furniture is elegant but not stuffy and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted The bar is rather small housing four 2seat tables a 4top and about 8 spaces at the bar Behind the bar light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughoutI browsed the martini menu not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter or too far from a martinitequila cointreau and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini  and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesnt send a good impression of your margarita I stuck with the classic then and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish It was made quickly and without love shaking instead of stirring and putting it in an unchilled glass Not that there was much to love while the bottles on the shelf could be called midrange the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel Bankers Club is the gin of choice here and Burnetts flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu The martini cameNot filled to the top seems they measure precisely to include garnish strong with little vermouth but given the alcohol devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrusI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant even though signage was still in place throughout the building I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab How much did my room temperature Bankers Club cost A cool 9It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management If you

    "review":"I have lived in this city for 4 years and am generally unimpressed with the restaurant located in Oakland  However Beta Bites has overcome this feeling and is one of my favorite locations in all of Pittsburgh  I highly recommend anything with chicken as their marinade is to die forVery glad Yelp recommended this place to me I came on a Friday evening at 6 PM and ordered a chicken sharmola sub for 855 after tax which came with fries Wait for food took about 13 minutes a very reasonable time given the 12 customers before meAs for the food all I can say is wow The chicken was so so tender and had a nice coating of spice The bread was fresh and soft and packed with vegetables The special beta bites dressing tasted like a variation of thousand island dressing perhaps mixed with curry and a touch of vinegar and the slightly sour taste added a wonderful flavor to the sub Also the sub was huge  about 78 inches Id say  as well as thick so very fillingThe fries were also hot and seasoned well with salt and pepper seemingly before cookedI will definitely be back to try more items on the menu Im very impressed considering I usually never order subs since a lot of places only offer plain boring options like turkey This place had so many options that I could never get tiredYoung workers there are also very friendlyThe chicken tagines are so yummy My kids love the pizzas We really love the different options that we cant get anywhere else We always call in ahead and pick it upThis place is amazing The fries are probably the best Ive had in Pittsburgh so far They also take a lot of care with every order and make sure the customer gets exactly what they want This is my first positive Yelp review so I obviously really enjoyed my first couple visits hereChicken sharmola I think thats what its called is EXCELLENT From the seasoning on the chicken to the homemade sauce Food was hot upon arrival and the prices were what I would expect in Oakland Wish I lived closer I would order from them on a weekly basisBeta bites has amazing food lots of choices and the hot bar is always amazing They deliver all over and the prices are great Perfect for office meetings or anytime Its also a nice place to meet friends and hang out"

    "review":"Came here on a Saturday night with reservations at 9:45 pm Important to note that the sushi part of the kitchen closes at 10 pm so come before then to try the sushi There was also a DJ making the atmosphere fun My friend and I started off with the Robatayaki chicken and scallion skewers It is a little pricey but was cooked well Would be willing to try more skewers I then had the salmon Temaki I had never had Temaki before and enjoyed the freshness of the salmon The presentation also made it with the pipette of Nikiri sauce I then had the pork and shrimp shumai which were standard dumplings My friend had the miso ramen and enjoyed it Said it was pretty good for ramen in Pittsburgh Finally we had the macaron desert which was a little overpriced for one Mochi and macaron but the presentation made up for it It was very refreshing and a nice end to the meal I definitely want to come back and try more of the yataiExceeded all expectations Even though it was crowded the staff was kind enough to look for and find places for me and my companion to sit The warm sake was quite nice I got the ground chicken over eggplant cant remember the dish name and I can honestly say that the chicken was the best Ive ever had The pear tart at the end of the meal was also exceedingly well made I will most certainly be backBy far one of the coolest places and experiences Ive ever been to So unique Will be back soon for sureThis restaurant failed me in so many ways1 Got ignored by the host lady She kept sitting played with her hair while its so obvious that I was standing in front of her2 The waitress was not polite she gave me a something far away from what is called good service3 Another waiter took away my plate when there was still sashimi left I had not finished it yet did you not see4 The taste of the food is just ordinary or even lower Sashimi was not so fresh ramen came with allsticktogetherinchunk noodle They did not know how to prepare grilled fish it was way too juicy Japanese does not cook grilled fish this wayIve been creeping on umamis yelp page since it opened and couldnt wait to go To get there find the big glossy black door on the side of round corner cantina climb the two flights of stairs and youre there I absolutely love the vibe of this restaurant The kitchen is open so you get to see all of the different dishes come out which is awesome if you are unfamiliar with the menu When you sit down you get a hot towel to wash your hands At first I thought this was unnecessary but after I actually used it I was really happy to have it and thought it was a nice touch Next you are offered sparkling water or tap and can order a drink We both got the lone wolf and cub combo of a Kirin Ichiban draft beer and a falling petal shot  cold surprisingly smooth sake with a dropper of hibiscus to drop in this was 5 bucks which I think is a pretty good deal The waitress showed us the highlights of the menu and we decided to get some things to share We got the takoyaki which are delicious deep fried balls of octopus and Im not sure what else but definitely get them  We each got a spicy tuna onigiri both came with a dropper of soy sauce pickled ginger and wasabi I was really suprised to find that the wasabi was actually real wasabi If you arent normally a fan do yourself a favor and try it because its completely different than the fake garbage most places servesame with the ginger We got an order of the pork gyoza they were so good and came with a really good dipping sauce The okonomiyaki which is the savory bacon and cabbage pancake also amazing And a couple skewers the shrimp eggplant and bacon wrapped quail eggs Those were awesome too We loved everything we ordered As we were leaving we saw the whole fish red snapper cooking on the grill Definitely think well try that next time This place is definitely worth a special trip and would be a great place for a date I cant wait to go backUmami is place that Id like to return to after a pleasant initial visit Its fun how the location is tucked around the corner from Butler on 38th and having to navigate the unassuming doors and hallways that go up into the restaurant Im confirming that the stairs can be a bit much such as if you have knee problems and if there are other people going in the opposite direction as they are narrow but I did ok Because Umami is an izakaya the space is small I went with 2 other people and interestingly we were seated at a counter versus a table Another odd thing that other reviewers have mentioned is that our waitress said everything on the menu is for sharing including the ramen Ill be ordering my own next time In any case we ordered the following to share: the special fish robatayaki bacon quail egg robatayaki pork belly robatayaki salmon temaki tuna temaki mackerel temaki okonomiyaki and karaage I would order everything again except for the special fish robatayaki as it was bland but everything else was delicious One thing that was new to me were the plastic pippetts with soy sauce that came with the handrollstemakis  I like how it controlled how much and when as I ate it"

    "review":"Delicious sauce and fresh made crust Daily lunch specials and 80 cent slices on ThursdayI love this Pizza  I grew up in Carrick near Sunseris pizza on Custer Ave  I believe this place has or at one time had a family connection to that place  They are similar but unique enough to warrant a trip if you like Sunseris  The pizza is good the sauce has a nice tangy oregano taste bordering on sour but in a good way  The crust is soft and chewyIf you go here and get nothing else get the twisties  Theyre hands down in the upper crust pun intended of bread sticks Ive hadWings are good and tangy but basic  I prefer more depth of flavor than just buffalo but they were cooked well sauced properly and tastyThey have some good specials too slice nights and hoagie dealsLastly for some reason I think that their fountain sodas are the best Ive ever had  No cola has ever tasted as good was what came from their fountain  A small detail but a perk nonethelessIve never had the salads there but they look fantasticThis place was fantastic Would recommend when in this area Mostly definitely a place I would come back to eatI regularly order their pizza special called a little charlies which is a small personal pan pizza w a large beverage THIS Their pizza is AMAZING This is the best pizza spot on the southside 4starsI got a calzone here buffalo chicken  It was huge and delicious We also ordered the twisters  They were amazing The sauce was delicious  My friend and I could have probably just gotten one calzone and the twisters with plenty of leftovers but with the prices being so reasonable we both got our own calzone and split the twisters  The pizza looked amazing too and big  Not to mention the people who work here are nice and laid back  Great place to get pizza in Pittsburgh Very very reasonably pricedI lived in Brooklyn and Staten Island most of my adult life Ate pizza at least twice a week for lunch and once a week for dinner With that said this would be above average pizza in my old stomping grounds Great crust quality mozz and tasty sauce Cheap too Add in the oldtime neighborhood bar feel and you get a great lunch and dinner experience"

    "review":"This is a cute little taco stand next to Reynas on 21st  I ended up stopping by here with my fianc for a light afternoon snack after our lunch wasnt enough food for either of us  The stand wasnt too much to look at as it was a couple of things cobbled together but there was a sign proclaiming their tacos to be the best in the city  As such I decided to go with a chorizo taco while my fianc went with the shrimp at 3 each  The man behind the grill cooked both of them up fresh while also warming the soft tortilla shells  He asked us if we wanted everything on them and we both said yes not knowing what everything was It ended up being some lettuce tomato cheese sour cream cilantro salt and freshly squeezed lime juice  I ate my taco right after receiving it and it certainly hit the spot  The temperature of it was perfect while the chorizo had a nice kick and my favorite part was the lime juice which gave a nice little sourness to combat the heat  My fianc also really enjoyed her taco and the shrimp that I tried was goodThe bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future  They had a number of interesting tacos burritos and empanadas that I noticed on the menu that I am sure I would loveThe tacos are very tastyId say the best youll find in Pittsburgh I am docking them a little because I think they are a little pricier than what I would like But I try to get to their location whenever I am in townMake sure you have cash because you CANT MISS THIS AMAZING TACO STAND We would go back every day if we could Its our favorite place on the strip to eat  I always get the 2 chicken tacos with everything on it and add your own salsa in the salsa bar to the side of the stand There are two picnic style tables to sit at They also have cheap specials that you can try including empanadas etc Theyre very friendly and sweet The quality is always consistent You can smell the deliciousness from blocks awayExcellent Everything was fresh and the meat was seasoned really well Well worth another trip thereThese are the most delicious and most authentic tacos ever So glad Im able to get food like this in PittsburghSo friendly and the most delicious tacos I have ever had I cannot wait to go back 5 star review hands down"

    "review":"Salt and pepper chicken a staple of mine for years Graduated a year ago and any time I go back to CMU its on the top of my food list That stuff is ridiculously yumI come to the food trucks almost every Wednesdays for lunch and Moonlite Express is definitely the spot with the most customers  Although the prices are decent for a poor college student the food quality is a bit subpar The first time I ordered from Moonlite I got chicken fried rice I was surprised when I took a bite and I tasted this strange orange spicy sauce they put all over the rice I dont really know what is was but it wasnt horrible just not what I expected as fried rice as it just looked like the rice was covered in the sauce and passed off as fried riceI got the pho a few times from Sunlite and it was okay They have a lot of options and their pho is definitely a step up from the one I had at Lulusnever again I only wish they gave a bit more meat and noodles for the priceI tried their most popular item today the Salt and Pepper Chicken and was satisfied The chicken was crispy and nicely seasoned and was served with a side of cabbage The only problem I had was when I took a bite of a chicken piece and cabbage piece and got a sodium overload It seemed that area was oversalted Otherwise it was an okay mealThere is no reason to eat at any of the food trucks at CMU other than for either price or convenience  They all serve bad food   That being said this is the most popular of the lot and probably the best only marginally  The portions are nice sized but the quality of the meat and vegetables is poor   The best things are the fried dishes salt and pepper chicken and general tsos chicken  The dishes all have way too much salt  The one redeeming factor is that the portion size to price ratio is good  Please dont come to eat here only do so if you are stuck with the limited choices on campusI recently ordered Szechuan tofu the small portion cost me 6 and change plus tip The rice was nice and fluffy instead of sticky and clumped together The veggies still had crunch and the tofu was fried nicely Dress all that deliciousness up with a sweet and spicy sauce and youve got yourself fantastic meal The service was extremely friendly and fastThis was my first CMU food truck experience On the school tours I was told over and over how the food trucks lined up on Morrison St were a must try for all students since the food is relatively cheap and fast So after my morning meeting I headed on over to Morrison St and walked past all the trucks to see what my choices were In the end I opted for Moonlite Express since they already had a few students lined up to buy their foodI thought Ok this must be the best one Let me just say I was not impressed First of all yes I know this isnt quality food here the chicken was fried bits of something which were neon pinkorange in color but Im pretty sure I can get better quality Chinese takeout for about a 1 moreI dont know As an undergraduate student whos broke hungry carless and naive this may do it But as a graduate student whos broke hungry able to drive elsewhere and aware of some better options it just doesnt cut itPASSAnother of CMUs many food trucks  It offers convenience for lunch on a busy day but not much more  These are fun to frequent on nice days when you can eat outside   The price is right and service is quick  I prefer a hot dog to many of the other choices however"

    "review":"Love the tea but the chicken was everythingWe stopped in for teas then went back for chicken about a week later The selection of tea flavors and bubbles is large enough to get a different combination every time all delicious You can even ask for less sweet The chicken was expensive but well worth the cost Coated in A sticky slightly spicy sauce that you will want to bathe in This chicken is good Its good warm and cold Its expensive about 1 per wing section but you will not be sorryAlso worth trying are the fries but the must try item is the Takoyaki It is batter dipped octopus bites of wonderful They also look really cool when you get them they appear to be moving These are not to take home They are not good cold and dont reheat wellAlthough the chicken is a little pricy these are the best wings Ive ever had in pittsburghnot only are the drumsticks enormous is that even from a chicken the skin is perfectly crispy and the sweet and spicy sauce was delicious I got the small size of both drumsticks and wings and it was 7 pieces which was pretty filling I also got the takoyaki which was 9 pieces for 5 which is a steal considering that the only other place to get takoyaki sells 5 pieces for 8 or something The mayo scallions and bonito flakes were all mindmeltingly delicious toppings not to mention the sensuous way that the takoyaki itself melted in my mouth It still tasted great after I reheated it later in the nightYes the food was delicious but what will bring me back to Chickn Bubbly Three wordsTaro Milkshake Smoothie First of all this is my favorite beverage in the universe The one they make here is the perfect balance between sugar and taro flavor Im crying just thinking about it I should have gotten one togo as well after I killed the large one that I bought with my dinnerThank you Chickn Bubbly You have brought immense happiness to my innardsOn my quest to try out more places I came across Chickn Bubbly after going to Oishii Bento where they offered 50 cents off a bubble tea at Chickn Bubbly with my receipt Like the name I got chicken and a bubble tea The chicken was pretty good Although the chicken was a little on the pricey side and a little too crispy for my taste I liked that there wasnt a ton of breading and it wasnt soggy at all like the chicken at most places I cant remember the exact name of the sauce but it was some kind of sweeter sauce and I asked for some spicy sauce as well Im a huge fan of sweet and spicy and I liked it The best part about this place in my opinion was the radishes included with the chicken They go perfectly together and I would probably choose this place over any other place because of those radishesUnfortunately the bubble tea wasnt that great I had been craving bubble tea for a while so I was super excited but it kinda fell flat It was a little watery and a little bland The tapioca balls were okay but I was left a little unsatisfied by the bubble tea overall I got my order to go so I didnt really have much experience with the service The person that took my order was polite I got my order pretty fast but there werent that many people For those that are thinking about eating in there really arent many seatsChicken: 4 stars  pretty good but not exactly to my tasteRadishes: 5 stars  seriously every chicken place in the world should have themBubble tea: 3 stars  okay but not greatService: 5 stars  no complaintsOverall: 4 starsThe chicken was great Super crispy skin and a nice amount of sauce I got the Soy Garlic Sauce and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Spicy both were good Originally though Id wanted the Chicken Salad on the menu but they said they didnt sell that My boyfriend also ordered radish pickles and was told those were included with the chicken They gave us a little plastic dressingcupful of the pickles which were decent Listening to other people order it sounded like other sides might have been included as well and I wish theyd explained our options when we orderedWe ate in the shop and they have little gloves for your thumb pointer and middle fingers which were very handy The chicken was great but this place is on the more expensive side Also two of the three times we wanted to eat there it was closed so be sure to check the hours before goingI never had Korean fried chicken before Dont get me wrong Ive always been a huge fan of Korean food But it was not until recently did I hear the phrase Korean Friend Chicken Tried it with a friend who has been here before and loves the food Ordering was easy they dont have much but fried chicken bubble tea of different flavors and some appetizers We got takoyaki and a large portion of sweet and spicy fried chickenTakoyaki was good If you havent had it please google gif files of how the thin fish flakes wave as heat convection occurs at surface of the octopusmeatball Looks nice and tastes even better But the chicken was so special that it completely dominated over the appetizer Perfect crispiness good sauce and satisfying portion We ordered a large portion  15 wings and 9 drumsticks The drumsticks were HUGE But we almost finished it Just give you a brief idea how good the chicken was Not a large restaurant takes a while to get the fried chicken and things can get messy when eating the chicken wings They have the smart application of this threefingerplastic glove you can put on and it is effective in terms of not getting sauce all over your hand Also rumors say that they have the best bubble tea in townHope you will enjoy it as I didI was pretty excited about this place but very disappointed I paid 20 for a wings and sweet potato fries Both items tasted like they were straight out of the freezer The food is much more photogenic then tasty"

    "review":"I loved this place so much I definitely think theyre a top contender for plainole good Thai food in the city The place is very cute inside It is comfortable clean and casualclassy but inviting The staff is very nice and you can see their true willingness to make good product We started our meal with crab rangoons which were excellent We then both got the pad thai and I thought it was fantastic It wasnt smothered in sauce that drowned the wonderful vegetables and noodles but instead coated them perfectly Its a great and welcome addition to Dormontps its BYOBWe had been wanting to try this place since it opened and it didnt disappoint Good Thai food at least in our minds is tough to find in the South Hills area and with this place less than a mile from our house we were hoping it was goodIt was The menu is large and the prices are very reasonable We ordered Pad Thai and Red Curry Chicken Both of which were delicious though I wish my curry was a bit spicier Our appetizers were the summer rolls and the peanut sauce was delicious The inside is small and they use a portable AC in the summer so it can be a little noisy but the service was great food was fast and we enjoyed our mealFood is ok not great  Ive had way betterMy favorite Thai is Nickys and Smiling Banana Leafbut Im in the South Hills and sometimes I dont want to drive there for a quick dinner  Enter Thai Spoon  Ive heard about it for quite some time but until recently havent tried it  Finally I did and Im gladAll of the items my family chose were extremely flavorful  The Bangcock curry was excellent albeit a bit sweeter than other curries Ive tried  Still an excellent choiceAlso had the Pad See Ew  I think it was on par with the other places I mentioned above which is a good sign as this is my favorite Thai Dish  I ordered it 5 but probably should have gone with a 6 just to kick up the heat to make it perfectAll in all I really liked Thai Spoon and will make this my goto Thai place mainly out of convenience  However it wont make me abandon the 2 best Thai restaurants in the city all togetherDecent local Thai food Friendly staff decent spice level and BYOB No it is not Nickys This place is still worth a shot thoughService was very good We had a great waitress Food was good Nice portion for entree but appetizers seemed a little skimpy for price But they tasted great We had taro spring roll and crispy corn fritters for appetizer  Spicy crispy noodle at  level three and Crispy chicken with orange sauce at level 9 spice Sweet sticky rice with mango was delicious but for price serving was a little small for my taste Nice ambiance This is my first try at Thai food so have nothing to compare it to but I would go back there to eat"

    "review":"DiBellas is the best sub I have ever had in my life  Im from New Jorsey and I agree that it is hard to get both a good slice and a good sub in this State  Why is that  DiBellas needs to open a place here  This was my forth time in Pittsburgh I do three things:  1get a garbage plate 2go to see theSteelers 3get a DiBellas subThe secret is the bread  Baked fresh at DiBellas all throughout the day  This aint no subway roll bleaacchhh  I dont know if they put an eggwash on the bread but its got a shiny brown coating on it that is really good  The next secret to a DiBellas sub is the condiments: all kinds of mustard and their oil is tops  I prefer honey mustard and a thin coating of mayonnaise  Secret  3: peppers  They have sweet hot and banana you gotta get the bananas  They are those awesome sliced neon yellow peppers that add just the right amount of kick to any subDiBellas does not skimp on the fillingsmany layers of topquality meat and cheese make these subs the best around  Average prices for incredible sandwiches corny 1950s decor with black and white tiled floor and wooden booths but nobody comes here for the decor they are comin here for SUBSI really like DiBellas The service and ordering system are both great The sandwiches are very good and very fresh I love their cookies too DiBellas beats Subway hands downmeh uncle sams and jimmy johns are better diBellas bread is delicioussoft and chewybut jimmy johns tastes better uncle sams cheesesteak is much more flavorful the first time i ate at dibellas i was very disappointed in their cheesesteak it was bland and i even got mayonaise on it the second time i tried a cold cut sandwich the roast beef wasnt as good as at jimmy johns but the bread was really thick and tasty i probably wont go back when jimmy johns is better and fasterI dont get the appeal that results in lines out the door or maybe thats just the poor setup where the line starts a few feet after you walk into the door  First off it is pricey for a sandwich shop  On the upside there are a lot of choices for you to customize your sub the way that you want it  Lots of meats and accouterments to choose from  The employees taking your order seem to be working at warpspeed to the point where your head might be spinning after you place your order  The cashiers and managers down at the other end tend to move a lot slower  Yet despite the frenetic pace of the frontline I always seem to wait forever for my sandwich usually about 10 minutes To be clear I order my sandwiches very simple  You are given a number then someone is running back and forth from the counter trying to hand out the sandwiches It is so unorganized and chaotic  The sandwiches are fine but nothing spectacular The portions are generous the small is quite large  The large is ludicrous  I wish they had a bigger assortment of bread some with seasoning like a Parmesan oregano for example  The pasta salad is good but over dressed The cookies are tasty  Unless you have a coupon be prepared to pay twice as much as you would at SubwayCan I just say the obvious here  Its Subway on steroidsEverything is just about as similar as you can get From how you order to how you pay However the most glaring difference here is the price When I went to pay I about hit the floor For their medium sub meal combo I could have had two foot longs at SubwayThe thing that I did fall in love with here was the bread I know the other place bakes theirs fresh as well but it does not compare to this  The crust kind of crumbles when you bite into it and the innards are so soft and great at keeping whats inside inside  And do they ever load up whats on the inside Im not talking about the fillers Im talking about the actually meat  I tasted more meat than veggie which pleased meThe one thing that I didnt really like was not being able to see the toppings Its great that they interact with you but its also hard to hear over everyone else that is in the restaurant  Plus I like to see that what is put on the sub is as fresh as the breadIn summation even though the price shocked me the taste out shocked me Is that a phrase  Oh well if it isnt Im using itFor a sub shop this place has a limited range of ingredients and an even unfriendlier staff  Upon entering I was treated as if I didnt know what I was doing  which was true  and also annoying because I was asking about vegetarian options  At that point Id leave a business but I had limited time and dont know the downtown area well  So I ordered something that was overpriced and just filled with olives and roasted red peppers  which wasnt filling so much as just satisfactorySo if youre a vegetarian or vegan stay away from this placeOtherwise I think meateaters might like this  Truth be told the service is what brings this review down  This must be a place where teenagers who dont care go to work"

    "review":"They were exceptionally accommodating to our large party for my grandparents 50th anniversary It was a wonderful event the banquet room was already taken but the staff was able to accommodate us in their dining area There was more than enough food and it was above par for banquet food The menu was an excellent value for what we got Very nice views of the river we got some nice pictures on the dock Outdoor seating is available which is really nice on a summer eveningWe read reviews about poor service but decided to go anyway When we arrived we were  told we would have to wait 25 minutes for an outside table  We sat at the bar and waited 40 minutes There were numerous empty outside tables available  Once we were seated we waited for 15 minutes and not one waitress came by to take our order  2 tables that were seated after us were waited on  We decided to leave  I spoke with the hostess and informed her of the poor service All she did was apologize and said that I am sorry that happened My friend spoke with a gentleman there who claimed to be the owner  He said the amount of time that we claimed to have waited was not correct  Funny how a timer set on your phone does not lie  Dont waste your time going here unless you have a lot of time to waste  Should have listened to the reviewsSo happy we came to Silkys Crows Nest My family wanted to try a restaurant on the water for a Saturday dinner and this was the perfect place The restaurant seemed busy but we got our drinks appetizers and dinner very quickly Beautiful view the food was delicious staff was very friendly and prices are reasonable I would recommend this place  to anyone who is looking for a night out on the water in PittsburghPoorly run restaurant why 1 star There is a nice view of the Marina and Highland Park Bridge Took nearly 90 minutes to receive pasta dish During the wait the server actually came over to table to see how we enjoyed our mealshe didnt seem concerned that we hadnt been served yet Overall I felt no one really cared and it was obvious that management was apathetic to the diners experience I could go on but my advice is just dont patronize the place and theyll be alright with thatI am retracting my previous 5 stars They have edited and edited their menu down so much that i have no idea what to order anymore They do not give out menus with their specials or soups listed anymoreThey fry their crabcakes all of a sudden taste like crap Dont serve Rachels anymore although they left their Ruben on the menu DO NOT ORDER ANY OF THEIR WRAPS They cant get any of them right Ive been trying other things here but they always end up in the To Go box then straight into the garbage when I get homeAnd please that woman who waitresses but is also an owner She has the absolute worst attitude She doesnt want to see her customers happy all she sees is dollar signs Screw this placeIf you must go here make sure its in the summer Thats when they have nice servers working but they never last longWe went to Silkys for a work lunch and it was one of the worst experiences Ive had in a long time We waited over an hour for our orders which were basic sandwiches and salads Our waitress wasnt familiar with the menu at all and clearly wasnt trained by a more experienced staff member After an hour I asked to speak with a manager and no one came to speak with me After asking a second time for the manager a gentleman came out and asked me what the problem was with an I dont really care attitude Our waitress then dropped off the bill before wed even received our food  Once our food came we asked for boxes and got out of there  This seems like a nice place to grab a beer after work but the staff has turned me off I wont go back"

    "review":"Fantastic Wonderful food reasonable price 1015 quick service great decor and pleasant staffMy girlfriend and I ate here for the first time last night and were both so happy with our experience that we agreed one of us had to write a review We made reservations though it wasnt crowded for a Saturday night Im assuming thats due to the the fact that the entrance is on a back street not Smallman Street Our waitress Jen was friendly and prompt We ordered the antipasta plate as an appetizer which was servered with bread and oil as well My girlfriend ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the ricotto gnudi both were delicious We split a slice of baklava cheesecake and chocolate gelato for dessertWe were both particularly pleased with the fact that our server held our next courses until we were finished with our current one Weve both eaten at upscale restaurants where they practically throw courses at you backtoback in an effort to get you out in as little time as possible It was a small touch but it really made an impact In total we had two drinks one appetizer one salad two meals and two deserts for a reasonable 70Needless to say this is my new favorite restaurant and well both be going back soonThis place has amazing food I would highly suggest the pizza or pasta I would recommend their salads as well Their meatballs are HUGE This place has true Italian and their presentation is perfect Everyone needs to come eat here PS: Sorry for the seemingly empty pictures went late at night on a ThursdayI guess the best way I can describe this place is underwhelming My dad had the margherita pizza and he said it was good I had the Chicken Parmesan and was disappointed in the portion It was one hockey puck sized piece of chicken and a cup of spaghetti The pasta though was fresh and deliciousthe best part of my meal Its an industrial looking spaceconcrete floors and exposed duct work it makes for a very noisy atmosphere It was hard to have a conversation across the tableMy husband and I enjoyed lunch here yesterday Everything is very fresh and most items are homemade My husband had the pasta and pork belly which was very tasty Who can complain about fresh pasta I had the meatball sandwich Delicious The bread was amazing Oh and the homemade mango sorbet Soooo good Great low key environment Really reminds me off a great European sandwich and pizza shop The staff is attentive and kind too Well be backA Saturday night at 7:30 and we easily made it in for a nice relaxing meal  Im surprised this place isnt as packed as its sister Cioppino  They share the same kitchen and sometimes have similar dishes  But Osteria is always less expensive for the almost the same dish  It has a classic bistro feel with the white subway tiles  Their food has always been great here  I have also taken a food and wine pairing class here that was very nice  If you are going out in the Strip on a Saturday night and need a great meal without having to wait at Kaya come to Osteria 2350"

    "review":"Went here with friends on a Saturday afternoonthe dining area was not busy at allthough youd have thought by the service it was packed fullit took forever for our drinks to come out which are WAY overpricedthe food is very sub par for the price wouldve been better off eating before we went to playmy entree came out plate hot food completely cold Ive never sent back food EVER but this was ridiculous The server takes my plate and says they would make it right I did NOT receive a fresh entree it was put in the microwave and sent back to me How do I know The bread and meat in the sandwich was still torn apart which I did while checking my food the first time to see if it was warm inside They did however take it off my check but never giving me a menu or asking me if Id like to order something else so my friends at the table gave me leftover ribs and fries off their plates By the time the server came back so I COULD ask for something else the table was already done eating so I just sucked it up and when went on our way to play the arcade  I highly recommend eating somewhere GOOD and then just go to DB to play waitress sucked overpriced food and drinksvery average food quality though lots of menu choicesarcade was funnice location easy to get toThe food was good but we Waited an hour for our drinks then 15 hours food then an hour for our bill Wont be back Not busy at all so not sure what the problem was Id hate to be there when they are busyMost of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits  Apathetic service staff all around the Peanut and I were really disappointed  Wont be backThe food here is awful  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us which can be challenging  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen but the waitress really tried her bestI only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese  Everyone else at the table hated their food  They all had sandwiches or other dishes  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our tables foodI was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games  All I have to say is no thanksHad an awesome time here with my hubby the food was amazing but the games cost so much an the prizes where ok but all in all a good time Ill be bring the kids with next timeI still love this place  I spent my 36th birthday at DBs and it was a wise decision  i had so much fun and so did my guest  I got a very attentive serving staff and met up with many helpful servers  I believe that service has improved so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars  No five stars yet because Ive still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it  Its still worth the visit and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price"

    "review":"We stopped here before a 1:00 Saturday Pens game  Almost every table was filled with Pens fans Friendly service draft beer specials and an above average kitchen for a hotel bar  Why pay out the wazoo for run of the mill stadium food and beer in the Console Center when you can have a good sit down lunch and drinks for a lot less right across the streetUgh  Disappointing  I should have been warned by other reviews that this is meant as a pregame bar for the Pens and nothing more  Staying here for work and hoped for a decent but quick meal after work  Its hard to mess up a chicken caesar salad but the lettuce had no dressing and the chicken tasted and looked microwaved  Told the waitress the salad was strange and chicken questionable after not eating my dinner and she smiled took the plate yet charged me for it  No sorry or would I like something else  14 for the salad to be exact half of which was for the mystery meat  Trust me walk the extra 10 or 15 minutes and get dinner downtown  Theres also way better hotel restaurants to be had in very close proximitysalad and pickles were moldy burger buns were stale wing sauce wasnt right these people need to get themselves togetherAte here a couple times while we stayed at the marriott city center  Food was good had late lunch and breakfast so far Staff is friendly and courteousVery friendly staff and the food is pretty good Whoever is in the kitchen seems to know what they are doing Can get a bit crowded even when there isnt a hockey gameI have never been so disappointed in overall quality of a dinner in a hotel of this status This restaurant should not be allowed to be affiliated with MarriottThe only meal that has been enjoyable was breakfast"

    "review":"The new Alfreds is such a welcomed place for the Polish Hill neighborhood In the two years weve lived in Polish Hill we had never ventured into Alfreds because we were never able to stop in during business hours Thats all changed with the stores facelift and updated hours We havent had an opportunity to get any of the freshmade sandwiches they offer but as a tiny grocery store it will suit most of your needs if youre looking to avoid the insanity of the large grocers With the later hours its perfect for grabbing some produce or basic ingredients that youre missing for dinner after work As a smaller store the only issue is inventory of perishables bread particularly by the end of the day but Im still a fan of what they offer The staff is really nice and passionate about helping the store succeed as well so if theres something that you wish Alfreds carried let them know and theyll look into fixing the hole in your shopping experienceIts also a veganfriendly store and they offer a lot of organic alternatives for those conscious of such things Sure it would be nice to see some cheaper alternatives for some products but I dont mind supporting the local business and paying a few extra dollars here and there Heck its still cheaper than the Quick Stop down the hillIn 2010 while moving here from Virginia I fell in love with Polish Hill and decided to rent an apartment nearly directly across the street from the former Alfreds Deli a store I admittedly never patronized due to my hectic work schedule Late last summer Leia the general manager of the store reopened this place after a period of renovation and has now quickly molded it into a neighborhood institution My partner Andrew and I love this market Their sandwiches are delicious Yes some of their items are on the expensive side but we honestly dont mind paying those prices for the sake of convenience and also to help keep our revitalizing neighborhood vibrant Im a processed food junkie since I dont like to cook cue the 50 Shades of Greylike whippings from the Whole Foods crowd but Alfreds offers a lot of items that are actually GOOD for you too Their homemade pierogies are delicious and I love the little recorded Thank you for shopping message that plays whenever I open the cooler to get more About two weeks ago I needed batteries for my wireless keyboard to write more Yelp reviews of course and sure enough Alfreds had them They also have treats for our dog veganfriendly items a limited assortment of fresh produce and staples like milk and orange juice They also carry some great Polish delicacies and my favorite Polish candies My partner is happy they carry cigarettes Im happy they carry these yummy offbrand but much better for you PopTartsAround the holidays my partner brought some peppermint fudge over for the girls to enjoy and they shared some delicious kielbasa and spicy mustard with us What a treat Supposedly there are definite plans for a juice bar and MILKSHAKES in the warmer months I can already envision hanging out with a sandwich a Polish candy bar and some delicious juice on a sultry Summer day Wishlist: It seemed like we kept running out of rock salt these brick sidewalks in our neighborhood are cute but quite slippy and I hated having to keep driving backandforth to Bloomfield or Shadyside to buy more especially before or after a trying shift at work We went through four big bags pretty much just over the past two months It would have been nice if the store would have carried some ice melt especially for older residents who Im sure would have appreciated a closer option to buy it PS Leia loves my wiener too my Dachshund that isyou gutter minds LOLCoupled with Lili Coffee Shop around the corner I can now say that if Polish Hill could just land a laundromat Id be as happy as a pig in its own excrementOutstanding sandwiches I wish I could eat there everyday Sometimes I buy the frozen pierogies and keep them on hand for a quick meal at home theyre always very good And they have a good selection of the things you need but dont want to or cant drive to the big grocery zones Alfreds is absolutely essentialGreat little spot for a quick sandwich pick up They do not skimp on meat The bread is fresh You bet your dupa we will be backAwesome pierogis picked up about four dozen along with other goodies Stuffed them in a cooler and brought back to Chicago Very helpful woman at the counter that helped us out Wish I would have grabbed moreThis weekend I was really missing my grandmother  her cooking I was in the mood for comfort food like pierogies I checked Yelp and found Alfreds which looked to be about 30 minutes from my home I found it easily enough Unfortunately I only had enough  with me so I could only one dozen of frozen potato as they were 9 That price seems to be the norm compared to other sites I checked At home I fried them in a pan with butter  onions until they were golden and slightly crunchy The potato filling was good and the dough itself was delicious They just went too fast so no leftoversI will definitely be back againand the the next time I will try the sauerkraut ones"

    "review":"Bad experience first visit but decided to try again Very good customer service this time and my food tasted fresh and properly cooked this timeWing Stop has awesome wings Theyre huge theyre crispy like they should be and the sauces and sides are fantastic Theyve quickly become my second favorite wings in Pittsburgh behind Wings Suds and Spuds I had never been to any of the other locations before so when I saw this one was opening right down the hill from me I was more than eager to finally try them outIve tried nearly every flavor on the menu here save for the teriyaki My three favorites would be classic hot Louisiana dry rub and Hawaiian The seasoned fresh cut fries are amazing but I seriously love the baked beans here The cole slaw is really good and the potato salad is top notch They also give you enough blue cheese ranch or whatever your preferred dip is that you wont feel like youve been cheated and need to order more at an additional cost Im looking at you BDubsSince opening Ive gone here so many times that I may as well be a chicken wing by this point The only problem I have with this location is that they obviously need more help Seriously The crew here is incredibly friendly but more employees are seriously needed They average every order to be ready in 2025 minutes but on a super busy night this can easily stretch to almost an hour because they get backed up with in house orders as well as phonein and online orders I used the mobile app a couple weeks ago to pick up my food on the way home from work and I wound up sitting there for an extra 30 minutes after arriving on time to pick it up They were just that slammed and didnt even have mine startedOther than that the food is amazingly excellent I was wary of it being a chain and all but these guys do wings the way I love them plus I can even get them well done if I want them even crispier I dig the inclusion of Fanta strawberry pop in the fountain It perfectly complements the wings here like Mountain Dew perfectly complements anything at Taco Bell or Dr Pepper makes everything at Sonic taste even groovier One other thing If you want to use the restrooms here theyre locked and a crew member has to take you back and unlock the door for you I dont know how long his policy will last and if its something all the locations do It will undoubtedly keep the bathrooms cleaner and stop wouldbe graffiti goons from tagging up the walls but it can also be a bit annoying when the place is busy and everyones trying to take and fill ordersThe restaurant is super clean and I dig the classic jazz music they play here Its definitely not the kind of tunes I was expecting to hear when I first walked in Since Im writing this review near Christmas they have switched over to all Christmas tunes as expected but generally its some tasty jazz from the greatsSo please Wing Stop hire some more folks and really start cranking those orders out I love your food and personally dont mind that wait most times but you can see the looks of agitation on other peoples faces as they wait and wait Otherwise youre doing everything perfectly Thanks for opening near meMediocre wings  I was really excited after hearing how good wingstop was  kinda disappointedThe best I love wings and was so happy this place came to Crafton I encountered it one night while picking up a pizza at Dominoes as soon as I saw it I instantly regretted buying pizza Ive been to Wingstop 4 times since Ive never reviewed a place before but this place is so good I think I shouldWings are big meaty and crispy I usually prefer the classic bonein wings but thats just my personal opinion Sauces are great Ive tried a few  Im a fan of spicy stuff so I like that they have so many choicesAtomic  super super hot pepper flakesseeds right on there If you get these Id recommend having one of their dip sauces too to cool it down a little bit and a lot of water Theyre so flavorful and spicyMango Hab  my fave Sweet and spicy  perfect combination I get these every time The sweetness makes them a little more comfortable to eat than the atomic but theyre still quite spicyOriginal Hot  self explanatory Its a pretty good hot sauce but their specialty sauces are so good I probably wont order this one againBBQ  also self explanatory I really liked their BBQGarlic Parm  Ive had this a couple times on the boneless the garlic is almost like a butter that soaks into the breading and then theres yummy parm cheese on top Big fan of these especially in boneless varietyAgain havent tried them all but everything I have has been excellent Since Ill be back often I appreciate that the staff is so nice I dont feel like theyll be annoyed seeing me a couple times a week : They have always made great suggestions and just all around great customer serviceFinally one last thing The fries I think they put crack on them or something The sweet seasoning is bombI was excited to see a new wing place open up nearby but wS not impressed with the 20 pack of wings I got  fries were good tasting but too salty garlic parmesan wings were tossed is a      salty powder with no garlic flor what so    ever I could only eat 1 out of the 8 Hawaiian flavor was good Teriyaki flavor was good but salty The other problem was the thick heavy    breading on the boneless wings Overall I was not too impressed If the cut down on the salt and used fresh garlic insteAd of powder maybe I would return I will say the online order was easy and the order was ready when promisedStopped in on a friday night for take out around dinner time Was told I couldnt buy just wings but had to choose some combo with fries and vegetables Than I wasnt allowed the wing sauces I wanted and that I could only pick from a select few that they offered  None of this made much sense to me  So I ordered three types of wings with the fries and celery I was forced to buy and brought them home When I arrived home I noticed the whole side of the papper bag was soaked with grease  I thought the fries were seasoned and tasted nice but the wings tasted over cooked most likely left frying to long the garlic sauce was bland and everything was far to greasy Was very disappointed and most likely will never return"

    "review":"This place is still new and there might be some growing painsI had the 2pc fish and fries lunch and while it was reasonably priced about 550tax with drink was more fries than fish  The two pieces of fried fish catfish were scrawny and there was very very little meat to eatService was very friendly and the place appears clean and well organized  The food was cooked fresh to orderIts definitely a mom and pop shop but they are seriously lacking in their instore signage and menusYou dont know what they have to offer and its just not clear to someone who hasnt been there ie most people when you first open what options are available While they have a large menu printed on a large sheet of paper  its mounted way too high and the fonts are way too small  The printed menusheet of paper is too cluttered to be quickly useful The combos listed dont helpI think I would have fared better with the chicken and waffles but for the meal delivered today was definitely not worth more than 2 starsThe food was great and the service was very good and quickFREE WIFI  while i ate I went before and the menu  was in need of a little help  This restaurant just  underwent a management change and they did address the menu situation because i was confused as well Lunch was good and I had a fish combo off the 500 lunch menu It was good and I had the Salmon croquette dinner that took me back down south ummm mmmmKeep it up Fredricks and you ll only get better 4 stars 85One week after I wrote my initial review I went back for some fried chicken and theyd already changed hands The chef has now taken over the business I went right at lunch time hoping for the best and walked in to find only other customer there  I ordered the 8 piece chicken which was supposed to be two breasts two thighs two legs and two wings Got it back to the office gave the breasts to my coworker and then took mine Instead of two thighs I had one thigh and one breast I just am NOT a breast man And frankly the chicken was ok it certainly wasnt as good as the first time Id tried itThe place doesnt even seem to have a name yet At this rate it may nottHIS IS ABSOLUTELY A HITNOT A MISS  this food was great and for 5oo you get wings and a muffin  900 was a complete lie in this first review the chicken and fish are cooked in separate fryers and if the first reviewer tasted fish on the chickensmh it might of been something already on her palette the corn muffin falls apart because it if buttery and fresh if she knew about soul food and black culture then she would know the real restaurants dont serve hard dry muffins like  she is used to making at her home with an  inaccurate recipethis is the only soul food restaurant downtown and i appreciate them  soul food is  variable and there are no exact recipes for the southern dishes that everybody prepares its your own style and   flavors you bring to the public if you know soul food then you know methods are handed down from generation to generation  but i really cant fault the first reviewer because she doesnt know any betterMy experience with eating soul food out is that it can be hit or miss  Fredricks Soul Food is a miss  The interior of the restaurant is just as formidable as the food The seating is hard high backed uncomfortable booth seating I  had the fried chicken wings  3 wings  with a corn muffin  The muffin was not baked long enough and fell apart as soon as I picked it up  Just three wings and a corn muffin came to over 900 a complete disgraceMy chicken wings werent the least bit tasty They came out tasting as if they were fried in the same grease as fish  I dont want to taste fried fish when Im eating wingsThe fried fish taste overpowered any seasoning on the chicken  Undercooked corn muffins and chicken fried in fish grease its just tacky and unprofessionalAs a new downtowner in employment Ive been scanning the possibilities for reasonably priced AND filling decent lunches and have found my choices to be somewhat limited Id passed Fredericks on my route to the bank several times per week and decided to give it a goMy first time in was pretty successful So much so that I raved about it back in the office and then took a coworker there for a second try and was intensely let downSo Im starting off by saying that Fredericks is hitormiss depending on the dayOn my first visit I walked into an empty restaurant checked out the menu and was in the mood for some good ol fried chicken The young gal behind the register was VERY sweet and helpful and I ordered a threepiece dark with fries and a diet Coke The guys in the back were friendly and welcoming fried it up fresh while I waited and I had a nice 8 lunch in ten minutes Took it back to the office and thoroughly enjoyed me some dynamite fried chicken  The outside was crispy and tasty with that kind of baconlike flavor that you can get when the skin is fried right and the meat was juicy and flavorful The fries were very basic not even salted but they were overall fine I had a very pleasant experience and planned to returnSo for the second visit I took my coworker and after my rave about the chicken she decided to try that with a side of macncheese I was in the mood for just fish and envisioned a nice slab of fried fish smothered in tartar sauce that would be as awesome as the chicken Another coworker had asked if they had greens and after a scan of the menu I decided to surprise her with an orderMy coworker ordered her chicken breast and side and I started to order my fish They were out of every fish but Tilapia Oh well I guess Ill have the TilapiaThis time the restaurant was busy and just a tad more than a tad on the undersophisticated side of the evolutionary scaleThe two ladies before us hemmed and hawed at what they wanted and they wanted it this way but no this way and with this side but no with THAT side and on and on The poor gal behind the register was getting a little frazzled and that was compiled by the we dont have that right now issue that they seemed to be having In the meantime the guys in the back seemed unable to keep up with the orders and didnt seem to be able to gain focus on what they were cooking which seemed to be going a little wrongSo my friend and I sat down to wait for our order and while we waited the undersophisticated patrons began to get very verbal and somewhat obnoxious about their orders This is NASTY  I want my money back  This macncheese is dry and terrible Blahblahblah Then there was a verbal altercation between two tables Oh boy a floor show while we waitWe waited a full half hour this time and after they dealt with the ranting I want my money back lady and the several trips to the table that insisted that they get the macncheese right or replace it our order finally came together I asked for a good load of tartar sauce which the gal put in the bag and my coworker and I were off to the office to eatHer chicken was good The macncheese WAS dry The greens were a nice surprise until they were opened and eaten and then they were a nice thought butSo I sat down and opened my 8 container of fried TilapiaAnd one package of tartar sauce was enough to totally smother BOTH piecesNow I cant say for sure  but I do believe that somewhere a fishing company operated by extremely myopic fisherman was duped into believing that a school of baby minnows on their way to a costume party all dressed as Tilapia were indeed a net full of adult Tilapia Ive had sardines that were bigger Two hours later I had to hit up another joint for some cheese fries just to feel like Id actually had some foodMy advice for those who are hankering for some soul food who were thinking of  giving Fredericks a try dont be totally turned away  but follow these simple tips instead1 Do NOT go DURING the lunch rush They get frazzled and disorganized and as a result so do their patrons Go BEFORE the rush or an hour AFTER the rush They really are very nice and they do make good food  when they can actually focus on doing just that 2 The fried chicken really does seem to be what they do best Unless they take a look at what other establishments downtown are offering as fish and change their portioning and prices it truly is not worth eight bucks for two fish mcnuggets Ive not tried their ribs not really being a fan so I cant speak for them But the fried chicken even during mayhem came out alrightIf youre in the mood for good fried chicken they beat the mystery meat of the colonel Follow my two tips and youll be fine"

    "review":"First off my pizza shop has been closed since October 2014 so for Scott p He gave a horrible review 4 months ago  not quite sure where you ate bud  but it definitely was not my pizza shop I dont have any control over this ad on yelp My best advice would be to ask where exactly you are ordering from when calling in an order Just moved to the area and decided to start sampling the local pizza places on our moving day   Got a couple pizzas for my moving crew and basically everyone was disappointed   I hate to say it but the pizza really just wasnt very good   Flavorless is the best description I could give   Someone had a hoagie as well which they said wasnt great either   For these people to have such harsh things to say about free food really speaks volumes I really should have found a place with a more extensive review history on yelpIf you visit the Pittsburgh area and youre close to The Waterfront West Mifflin Downtown or Monroeville area its worth the trip to a little place called PerrinosPerrinos is a little market primarily for the community but the creativity and charm of this place will keep you wanting to come back for more Every day at 6AM they have breakfast options from fresh homemade breakfast sandwiches to breakfast pizza as well as lottery drinks and everything in between but its at noon when things usually kick offAny day of the week you can find fresh crispy pizza creations by the New York sized slice From classic concoctions like Pepperoni Mushroom and Plain to the Frankenstein creations like Big Mac Pizza Reuben Pizza Pierogi Pizza Roast Beef  Cheddar Pizza Steak and Cheese with fries on it Buffalo Chicken and the hole gets deeper trust me youll wanna go as far down the hole as possible They have fantastic Burgers with the same creative flair with toppings and fillings and even do fresh cut fries made like the famed potato patch fries at Kennywood They have fresh salads crispy chicken hoagies made with care and just the right amount of toppings The menu would turn this review into an encyclopedia just know youre going to have multiple tripsThe surprises of Perrinos daily specials is where you really get that loyal customer value Always new one off creations from fresh sandwiches experimental pizza toppings and fresh revolving deliFamily owned and operated this place is perfect for breakfast lunch and dinner With their new renovations in 2014 and the extra staff on hand it makes it a relaxing environment to eat and talk with the locals Its more personal than we are used to in the digital age so dont be surprised to see teens hanging out regulars getting their daily necessities and laughing and jokes by the staff Its a lot like those markets on movies you wish you could visitNow go check out Perrinos"

    "review":"With the lack of a Chipotle downtown Moes is my goto for a tasty burrito or taco  They treat vegetarians right having a tofu option and the meatless options cost almost a dollar less than their meatfull contemporaries  Lots of different options all with silly names spanning Burritos Tacos Quesadillas Salads and Nachos  Ingredients seem pretty fresh everything comes with chips and salsa 56 different options  Can be VERY busy on a weekday lunch but they move people through very quickly  Outdoor seating on the square is also niceWelcome to Moes  Friendly staff fresh food everything is soooo tasty Free chips and salsa with any order What else can you ask forSince the line at Chipotle was almost 30 people long yesterday I decided to check out this Moes instead I was surprised to be the only person in line after seeing the insanity at their Mexican food competitor across the street I ordered a Chicken Taco and Queso with Chips The Chicken Taco was dismal The quality of ingredients was much lower than what you would get at Chipotle I was also barely able to eat the taco since it was so overfilled However the queso was delicious I have been dieting but I couldnt stop eating the wonderfully rich and smooth while mildly spicy cheesiness Mmmm This restaurant really deserves only 2 stars so they are lucky that their queso is so fantasticoWent here for dinner with my niece  Its fresh fast food  I thought the prices were reasonable  The portions were a good size  They give you free chips and they have a free salsa bar  My niece likes the soda machine You can pick between a lot of different flavors   I have to admit I enjoyed it as much as the kids  Who doesnt want to mix cherry coke with lemonade and orange sodaI had a vegetarian taco It had beans tomato lettuce rice and guac and sour cream It was good Like I mentioned everything tasted fresh The guacamole was homemade  Its worth checking out if youre in a hurry and are looking for something other than a burgerThe employees are friendly but the food itself is pretty bland The meat and sauce is very unspiced and just doesnt taste Mexican at all It doesnt even really taste like food actually its just like chewing a flavorless stick of gum  you know something is in your mouth but it doesnt taste like anything at all The only decent thing was the queso and chips so you can try that if you absolutely must go here but I would advise finding a better place if you want MexicanMoes is meh Bland Americanized Mexican food Nothing special Go to las velas or chipolte instead both are in market square"

    "review":"I never even made it inside After pulling into the parking lot and getting out of my car I was greeted by a HUGE bouncer who wanted to search me If a pizza place needs a bouncer then it is NOT the kind of place I want to eat at Must draw a dangerous crowd or somethingA vehicle with the doors truck opened music playing backed up to the front door was my first indication that I was is in the wrong place  The bouncer was pleasant however he wanted to search me prior to entering  I said no and turned around and left  You may want to consider having the pizza deliveredIve never posted a yelp review before  This meal was so horrible that I downloaded the yelp app just so I could warn others to stay away  We ordered food from Capri since we were going to voodoo brewery  We ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an Italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones  We ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an Italian wedgie which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions  No sign of Italian meat to be found  No marinara sauce  It was inedible  We ended up walking to kfc instead  I want to leave a zero star rating but yelp wont let me  So they get an undeserved starI judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni  While grabbing a brew at Voodoo my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street We ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up  I was pleasantly surprised  The cheese was not greasy the sauce was flavorful and the dough was chewy yet crunchy what more could you ask for  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from CapriNext time well try the pepperoni and post an update  I see yummy pizza in our future  If youre grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly order something cheesy at Capri Pizza in Homestead"

    "review":"Fun place to have a meal on the porch  Stopped by for lunch and the weather was perfect for eating on the porch  Fun to watch the people pass by  Kids on scooters ladies rushing to parking meters from the hair palour next door to put money in the meter with the smocks still on and hair in all kinds of conditionslol   Nice little menu of Soups sandwiches salads wrapsOrdered the Salmon encrusted with dijon mustard0 salad special of the day  Was informed it was the last one and I did not go late  Salad had fresh lettuce tomato onion carrot and came with 2 slices of a nicely toasted bread  The salmon was over powered by the mustard due to the large amount put on top so I took some off  Unfortunately the salmon was under cooked  Had a similar salmon salad at a restauant a few doors down recently that was better and less expensive and that restaurant is much fancierNote:  OPEN Monday thru Friday 11 to 9Note 2:  Was advised to make sure the meter was feed so as not to get a parking ticketMy husband and I went for dinner on one of the last warm nights in the fall 2015 before it was too cold to sit outside  We took our pooch as well  The porch is a nice space and theres definitely enough room to have a dog without bothering any other tables and they brought our dog water which was nice  Its definitely more of an old school cooking style eatery  I had a filet and my husband had some sort of fish  My steak had a great char on the outside yet was pink just as I wanted on the inside  But there was a lot of butter on everything  It made our meals feel very heavy and it wasnt necessary  The potatoes and vegetables were drenched in butter  Im a potato lover and I left them on my plate  I just couldnt bring myself to eat any more butter  Id go again maybe for lunch or drinks to sit on the porch  But itll be a while before I have dinner thereCute place less than stellar food The salmon was far underdone scallops were sitting a an odd tasting soupy sauce fettuccine and sausage was good but sitting in too much oilExcellent Lunch  Excellent Blackened Salmon Salad  Excellent Wine by the glass  Exceptional Value with great serviceWe walked over here after rude treatment at Cornerstone Great food and service  Wait staff were very responsive and friendly Such an improvement over the CornerstoneBeen here a few times and this place always has great service and food My fav is sunday brunch"

    "review":"I am not a huge pizza connoisseur so I didnt find anything that terrible about their pizza I got a deep dish and it was pretty good The small was more than enough for one person The cheese was plentiful and the sauce tasted just fine for me Maybe its not the most authentic pizza in Pittsburgh but it sure hit the spotThere is an out of his mind hateful prejudiced middleeastern guy that works there that actually called 911 on me  2 African American guys in line behind me 4 absolutely no reason I had asked politely 2 speak 2 the manager because was really being harassed by drunk guy in there  he screamed at me then went off on the guys in line behind me We at no time raised our voices were rude back were totally sober polite well dressed I did tell the guys behind me hes just a jerk because they were stunned at how they were screamed at young guys who happened 2 walk in while he was being rude 2 me then he threatened 2 call 911 on us  I said why because youre prejudiced so he CALLED THE POLICE screaming at me I HAVE YOUR FACE We left Beyond ridiculous I believe in being honest about my actions swear 2 God this is what happened So an urge 4 pizza might land u in jail if u go here not worth it was really disturbing What kind of place tolerates this kind of behavior from employees At 1 point the cook walked up hearing the dudes yelling but saw dude was just losing his mind  walked away So I guess the middleeastern guy was in charge happened on a fri around 12 amWe ordered a specialty pizza and requested that it be well done  The pizza came and the crust was anything but more like bread  We called to request a replacement and the young girl who works there was EXTREMELY RUDE and put me on hold 4 times in the 10 minute phone call the first time for 3 minutes  The wanted to pick up the pizza first and then bring the replacement we live 5 minutes from the shop  I requested that they pick it up when they bring the new one  The last time I was put on hold I hung up and personally took the pizza back  I had taken 2 bites from mine and my hubby took one and then gave the rest to the dog  They wouldnt do a full refund as we ate some of the pizza  Never again and its a shame as we were steady customers ordering from here at least once a week  The manager never even came out to talk to me  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICELate night pepperoni pizza  and we were very pleasantly surprised Good cheese good sauce  yum We would definitely come backThe Sicilian za hit the spot at 3 AM after some late night boozerelated revelries It did take a half hour for them to make it but at least that gave ample time for macking on the local ladies who also claimed they were from LA like all starstruck Pittsburgh girls do for some reason in the seating area However the guy taking orders would not accept my offer of a 100 tip to bump my order to first in line on the list: WeirdI stumbled on this place late one night when I was starving and looking for something by my hotel With its booths and that tacky red vinyl seating I remember from childhood pizzerias in NJ it looked good so I went in  The staff was kind of gruff but my pizza was delicious That was 2 years and 5 visits agoFast foward to last weekend  Staff is still gruff but pizza is just pretty good  Its no longer that much different from any other nearby pizza place and it looks like their large pizza isnt as large as it used to be  But since I never really measured them I cant be sure Bottom line is I will go back if Im nearby but I wont make a special effort to go there anymore"

    "review":"We were able to get dayof reservations for a Friday night at 8:30pm  The restaurant was small tastefully decorated and brighter than your average evening fine dining restaurantWe got:two glasses of Cabernet great wine fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes  Delicious with a little coarse salt and balsamicchopped salad with a little cheese salami and a very tasty vinaigrette  Even though I am not much of a salad person it was great and tasted very freshsalad with balsamic dressing  wasnt as good as the chopped salad but still quite goodhalf order of fresh pasta with Parmesan zucchini and tomatoes the perfect size for a lighter meal I ate all of it  I worried the pasta would be too heavy for a late dinner but it was perfect in the smaller portionskirt steak this was my boyfriends third dish with balsamic  Perhaps by that time he had had enough balsamic but it wasnt stellar  The meat was cooked perfectly and the portion was generoustiramisu tastyFrench press coffee and cappuccino very good as well fresh Overall it was an excellent meal and the smaller portions allowed us to try many different things on the menu  Without a doubt we will be back as the menu changes seasonallyweekly  The menu was smaller so you could tell how the chefs spent time curating each dish and picking items in seasonWent to Stagioni after a long wait since reading about it in Pittsburgh Magazine as one of the top restaurants in the city  I made a reservation for four my wife daughter of 13  son of 14 and me at 6:00pm Ill start by saying the food and service were excellent The atmosphere was surprisingly subdued for a Saturday night at 6 on the Southside the night before a home Steelers game It was like a funeral home in there when we first walked in and didnt liven up at all by around 7 when we left  I wasnt expecting DisneyWorld but I was expecting more tables to be full and a little more restaurant noise  It was very quiet so our dinner conversation was very quiet too to match the ambiance A little uncomfortable for a kid from an IrishItalian family from Jersey if you know what I mean  The food like I said was excellent We started with the fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomato dish apparently so does almost everybody and it was fantastic The cheese is served warm but not melted over the tomatoes and enhanced by a balsamic reduction and a touch of sea salt  For dinner my wife and daughter are not as adventurous as my son and me so they got the linguine and the gnocchi respectively with a house made tomato sauce they have at the ready for just such customers A great idea and they both loved the fresh made pasta  My son also had the gnocchi but had it the way the chef planned on serving it crumbled Italian sausage and bitter greens in an olive oil based white wine sauce He loved it and actually said the greens were the best part for him What  I had the fettuccini in a brown butter sauce with lobster meat The fresh pasta was outstanding the sauce had a TON of flavor and complimented the lobster really well  I forgot to mention the gnocchi was a ricotta based and not potato great move and done perfectlyOur server was very nice and attentive She got us what we wanted in a timely fashion water bread Italian sourdough or ciabatta wine for us and soda for the kids All things considered I would go back for the food and service but not the atmosphere  The chef seems bold and adventurous and changes the menu often so we were told Ill have to go back to find outEnjoyed a good meal late on a Saturday PM   Surprisingly not crowded given the reviews but traffic picked up a bit later in the evening   Service was outstanding  the waiter explained dishes well inquired indepth about food allergies in response to a question about a specific ingredient and paced the meal perfectly   Appetizer of the fresh mozzarella with tomatoes was great   Food was wellprepared portions were adequate if not a bit on the small side    Worth a tripEXCELLENTVery cute new building in South Side service was fantastic and the food is delicious The homemade mozzarella and chop salad were some of the best Ive ever had Will definitely returnThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice  Unfortunately that is all  Our server was a disappointment  Did not explain dishes correctly did not ask how any of our plates tasted  When my wife pointed out something on her plate which didnt taste good his words were oh ok  After a while we decided to relate or communication with the host  The food was a big disappointment which seems to be normal for Pittsburgh  Appetizer of Mozzarella and Prosciutto was way too large  The cheese was bland and the prosciutto sub par in taste  Nothing creative on the plate just slices of meat a big ball of cheese some vinegar and a roasted yellow pepper compote which actually tasted nice  The other appetizer was Polenta which was smothered in what we believe to be a ragout which used canned mushrooms  If they were not canned then they were made far too early for this service or quite possibly the day before  This plate was a major crash  terribleAfter this we shared a salad of endive and radicchio which had way too much Pecorino not enough acid in the vinaigrette and was chopped very sloppy in the kitchen  The plate was boring and not tasty  I asked for a lemon to add some vibrancy and acidity to the dish this was the only way to give it lifeOn to the mains:My wife had duck  First let me say the duck on the plate was cooked outstanding but everything else on the plate was terrible and didnt make sense  I think the duck was cooked sous vide as it was perfectly moist  This led me to think how can this chef have so many bland and imperfect dishes but nail the duck  Quite possibly this technique of cooking duck came from another restaurant chef in town  hmmm Salt of The EarthI ordered what they called a lamb steak  Very tough and chewy over salted and way too large  It was paired with crispy gnocchi which had no chance of being crispy because they laid the steak on top of the gnocchi  Also the gnocchi was flatin terms of prep this basically means that whoever made it overworked the dough  We shared a bottle of cheap Italian wine which had the typical American triple mark up in price  No dessert and all this for only 130enjoyWe ordered the homemade mozzarella plate as an appetizer and it was soooo good and Im not even a huge fan of fresh mozzarella  They sprinkled some salt on top which I think balanced the flavor of the cheese and the balsamic drizzle  For the entree I ordered the scallops with roasted cauliflower pine nuts golden raisins and parsley  The scallops were fresh and delish  I would highly recommend  Most of the friends I was with ordered the gnocchi and really enjoyed it  All in all everyone was really satisfied with their meal and we didnt feel rushed to finish so were able to enjoy a relaxed meal together"

    "review":"LOVEEEEE THIS PLACE Its a southside secret since its a little off Carson but definitely worth going to The BARBACONE is incredible Mac n cheese pulled pork and coleslaw all in a waffle cone Many times Ive gone the place has been pretty quiet but only because no one knows about it Everyone has seen the food truck but we gotta spread the word about the restaurant Definitely go try itBrought the family to try the BBQ  We got ribs pulled pork chicken and brisket  We loved it all and I thought the ribs were awesome  It is only one block off CarsonOk bbq food was cold I had the bbq chicken pulled brisket grilled sweet potatoes and sweet corn bread Meats were cold Very polite staff thoBest ribs in Pittsburgh Friendly staff old school vibe in the restaurant The kind of spot that you dont mind hunkering down in for a few beers Jalapeo cornbread is also greatWe ordered this for delivery tonight and the food is just ok I have yet to find barbecue on Pittsburgh that is really good I had the pork barbecue sandwich and it was soggy My partner had the ribs which were decent The pepper jack Mac and cheese was decent Not sure Id eat here againI just went to Southside barbecue on 17th street There was a 6 off coupon buy one item get one item in the enjoy book so we figured we would try it out for an inexpensive lunch We went in and My husband wanted the pulled pork entree and i ordered the 12 of bbq chicken I specifically asked if there was ANY spice on the chicken and I was told NO There were no sides with the entrees and they offered a family platter that consisted of most of their sides for 13 We decided we wanted to try the food and we could have leftovers for tonight  The family platter came out and most of the food was burnt It consisted of very small servings and wasnt worth the 13  The entrees came out and the pulled pork that wasnt cheap was very small portion and it was dried meat with a squirt of bbq sauce on it My 12 of chicken came out looking like 12 of a Cornish hen and was VERY spicy  I asked the waiter to replace the chicken for a hamburger The burger was great Then we received the check They charged me for the chicken even though the burger was cheaper I told the waiter and he said since nothing was wrong with the chicken I was getting charged for that and they gave me the burger as a courtesy I told him that was unacceptable and then he went and got who appeared to be the owner At this point my husband was ready to blow a gasket so I asked him to allow me to talk to the owner The owner reintegrated what the waiter said I explained that I was told there was no spice on the chicken so there was something wrong with my chicken He argued for a few minutes but in the end took off the chicken and charged us for the burger He did this very rudely and said that he needs to make money and you dont get something for nothing He then pointed out that we had a coupon He said the coupon was 6 off when you bought two entrees The waiter told him the coupon states two items This only made the owner angrier because he had to honor his coupon After this was all done and we paid our bill we overheard him tell other customers that everybody wants a discount Im sure he was in reference to us We will not go back again because of our experience Customer service is key to owning a restaurant Theres a way to and not to talk to a customer and he was a prime example of how NOT to treat a customer"

    "review":"Ive eaten the Onion Maidens delicious vegan food at pop up events around the city and Im always extremely impressed with the taste quality and variety of what they have to offer Everything is very reasonably priced which is rare for specialties like cashew cheese and lentil chili on vegan hot dogs Your order is also served quickly by very courteous people and it comes piping hot and fresh I guess the freshness is what sets Onion Maiden apart the most for me Food truck fare doesnt always seem to be made from scratch and composed of the freshest best ingredients which can leave me in a junk food coma after a visit to one I never feel that way after eating the Onion Maidens food though so I hope they keep it up for the sake of everyone on a restrictedvegan diet or those of us who simply want a healthier optionYOU GUYS  I just went to Onion Maidens pop up at The Vandal today for lunch and HOLY JEEZ LOUISE was it amazing Side note: Can I swear on YelpIve been vegan for three years and this is some of THE BEST food I have eaten The hot dogs are better than the usual veggie dogs that permanently live in my fridge  I got the Manowar cashew cheese and the Hurricane 1000 island dressing kraut slaw and I will never be the same Even the buns were outstanding  toasted and a little crunchy I also got the Darth Taters which were just tater tots but somehow still magical  OhandTHE EDDIE which is Onion Maidens very own version of the Twinkie and hello I am currently typing from food heavenThe cashew cheese on the Manowar was kind of like the Velveeta youd slather all over your hot dog as a kid or lets be honest as an adult It was warm and gooey and melty and perfect I could have eaten just the cheeseThe slaw on the Hurricane was a little bitey and a little juicy but the toasted bun held up against the sauerkraut juice as well as the thousand island dressing and didnt get soggy at all The cabbage in the slaw still had a little crunch and wasnt cooked to oblivion like some notsohappy slaws Ive had in the pastThe hot dogs themselves were perfect Really no other way to describe them They had the same taste and texture as an all beef frank but none of the beef I could see these being grilled up and served at Heinz Field to 60000 happy and satiated herbivores and omnivores alikeGet your bum down to Vandal to check Onion Maiden out right away And follow them on Facebook to keep an eye on where they will pop up next Hopefully to a brick and mortar store near youbut preferably meBomb Bomb dot com Delicious plump and fresh hot dogsBring all your vegan and nonvegan friends do those exist ha ha here and feed them these hot dogs The vegans will be convinced these are real dogs made from real meat ew and the nonvegans will not believe that these dogs are totally animalcruelty free They even have a hot dog named the Kimmy Gibler  does it get any betterThey serve vegan nachos and baked goods including deepfried twinkies their own version of a twinkie Their sweets are also available at Black Forge Coffeehouse in AllentownFollow them on social media to find out where theyll be posted up Currently Onion Maiden is operating as a food stand They are known to frequent Spirit in Lawrenceville and Lili Caf in Polish Hill"

    "review":"Id probably give this place a 35 as is Firstly It is the Pittsburgh Public Market which is full of cool vendors but it is a little bit further from the heart of the Strip Anyways Ive been craving some Cajun food and there arent too many places in the Burgh specializing in this cuisine in my opinion When I was looking for something different in the Strip I was surprised that Ive never heard this was on the area and immediately was thinking of my trip to Mardi Gras with delicious po boysSo I made the trek a couple extra blocks and got the andouille sausage po boy and the gumbo Im not an expert but the po boy was not quite what I remember It was good but difficult to eat The bun was falling a part and toppings were falling as well Not totally surprising but the sausage was difficult to bite off and left me using my fingers to break it a part The shrimp probably wouldve been a better choiceAs for the Gumbo I liked it too but the roux had a bit too much flour in it for me and the rice was a tad undercooked All things considered it was good but the price was a tad steep at 11 for about a 7 po boy and 4 for the gumbo was a little fairer in my opinion Overall worth a shot of you are looking for something different but then again there is no shortage of options in the Strip DistrictFinally some good Cajun in western PA Gumbo and po boys are awesome I am from the South and have had numerous po boys in New Orleans and this tastes like the real dealGumbo  awesome Lots of andouille sausage well spiced flavorful not wateryGrilled Shrimp Poboy  Great a little messy lots of fantastic remoulade and a little pricey but its a big sandwich Hefty portion of cajun seasoned shrimp w lettuce  pickles The bun was toasted perfectly so that it was soft yet slight crispy without being tough or hardVery friendly serviceMenu looks like it will change seasonally or even weekly looking forward to going back will update after getting different menu itemsI first stumbled upon PGH Po Boy on Small Business Saturday on a sudden trip to the Pittsburgh Public Market Ben let us place our order and then walk around while he prepared our food  a nice gesture that I am not sure everybody would think to offer When we came back our order was ready My fiane and I decided to sit at the counter to eat I had the shrimp po boy and my fiance had the crawfish grilled cheese The po boy was fantastic Was it messy as previous reviewers have said Yes But does that speak towards the quality of the food Not in my book A lot of the best food I had in my life was some of the messiest food I had  this wasnt even some of the messiest yet it still was some of the best I had a bite of the crawfish grilled cheese and it was equally as good  I have subsequently ordered it as my main dish now Furthermore Ben gave us a small sample of the gumbo which was some of the best gumbo I have had in my entire life  which honestly doesnt say much  however upon subsequently ordering a full serving of the gumbo my fiance whom is a Baton Rouge Cajun native opines that Bens gumbo is the best she has ever hadBottom line is the food is great If you have the time to talk to Ben the conversation is equally as good Excellent people and excellent foodGreat little place inside the Pittsburgh Public Market The offer Gumbo Muffalettas and Po Boys along with a few other things I ordered a Shrimp Po Boy The sandwich had lots of grilled shrimp tomato lettuce and a spicy remoulade It was served on a warm bun that was perfect for a Po Boy I lived in New Orleans for a couple of years so I know good Cajun food This is good Cajun food Cant wait to go back and try a MuffalettaAbsolutely amazing New Orleans inspired cuisine right here in Pittsburgh at the Public Market Ben the owner has to be one of the nicest and most genuine business owners that I have ever met The gumbo is delicious just spicy enough with lots of good quality meat and vegetables The crawfish grilled cheese was so good and such a large portion for the price I want another one right now From muffalettas to po boys you have to try this food I go to New Orleans several times per year and this is the closest you will get to this kind of cuisine in Pittsburgh I know a lot of pittsburghers are scared to try new things but do yourself a favor and branch out of the norm and get to Pittsburgh Po Boy"

    "review":"The expression a diamond in the rough was made to describe Nicos At the outset Nicos looks like a garage to fix cars in because of the large painted sign outside However inside there is a full bar with a restaurant and tables The food is pretty good bar food and its a karaoke hotspot on Saturday nights The karaoke crowd is pretty diverse and if you are really lucky you may catch Abba singing the Dawsons Creek theme song Waitstaff is nice as well 5 stars for the recovery roomAtmosphere wise this is pretty nice as far as a divey neighborhood bar goes Theres a ton of seating or at least it seemed that way Monday night when things were pretty slow Menu items were very reasonably priced However no beer menu WeirdA friend and I each ordered a pumpkin beer after the waiter told us what was on tap and we got the special for Monday night: Two dozen wings for 9 bucks We got a dozen BBQ and a dozen with Cajun dry rubUnfortunately the wings were deep fried for so long the meat was somewhat dry The service was a little off too maybe because it was a slow night but the bartender was playing double duty as the waiter Which I didnt realize until we were leaving He was really good but he wasnt able to come by muchHoping to get back here again sometime since my friend lives a few blocks away but might just bypass all things deep friedAt the higher end of the dive bar world you have Nicos I say higher end because its not as dank as most Its older but has so much character and Im not just referring to the patrons Its a neighborhood joint with stand up comedy and karaoke Good food The gyros are as good as any youd get at a Greek restaurant Nice little bar The crowd ranges from millennials and hipsters to old timers and bikers Eclectic mix of peopleThis was my favorite spot to grab wings Monday night was wing night and you could find us there at some point in the eveningThere are multiple sauces to choose from but celery and ranch are definitely extra The bar tender usually doubled as the server which made for a looooong wait between refills and extra napkinsThe crowd is neither friendly nor non friendly Servers were just about the same If it was a busy night they never picked up the pace to match All in all good food and alright serviceThey have karaoke Saturday nights if youre into that sort of thingBar none the best karoake in Pittsburgh Saturday nights This is one cool dive bar which in one room has a full 360 bar and the other room a bunch of tables and booths for sittin and singin Ive been here more than a dozen times and have always had a blast I know its not everybodys cup of tea but there is no funner night that grabbing some pitchers with a group of friends and making a fool out of yourself behind a mic And this is the perfect place for it By no means is this a place for upscale cocktails with the coworkers: were talkin cheap beer really smokey loud and just a damn good time One the many reasons I was excited to move to Friendship Park was to be within stumbling distance of Nicos Whether it is after work or a late night hangout with peeps this has become my neighborhood dive bar and it perfectly encapsulates the spirit of PittsburghReasonably dope spot p chill most times Cant turn up  here but can chill p hard Classic Food is p dank and drinks are cheap but all around vibe isnt max dope but kinda dope True head spot v Pittsburgh If youre looking for Pittsburgh and not LITSBURGH look here  I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse Florence Nightingale"

    "review":"Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner The server was very friendly but seemed a little overwhelmed Maybe they were short handed  The food was to me not even average I ordered a burger which very overdone and dry Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle then put cheese and one jalapeo slice on each piece Imagine 6 halfmoons of taco shell  Not like any nachos Ive ever seen and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered themI called ahead so we didnt have a long wait I checked in when i got there recieved text from them as well as downloaded the no wait tip All was working until we had one in front and nothing socthey sat 4 more tables and we ask and they dropped my reservation Luckily the lady at the booth saw my text from them and cleaned a table and sat us right away but that was pretty frustrating being 9 months pregnant w a 6 yr old and my mother in law w back problems and having to stand there when we should have been seated Otherwise the food was great i got endless apps and it was so filling for the money Service was excellent we had Ed and we was really great made the experience very pleasant so thank you to him Overall good experiance other than the reservation experiance and FILTHY bathroomsFridays seems to have gone down hill I was quite surprised when we went and there want a wait I thought we had lucked out We were seated quickly and our server came over quickly There was only one other table that had people in the section we were in I ordered a Jack Daniels burgercooked medium Our food came quickly My burger was well done and dry Without the Jack Daniels sauce there was no flavor at all  The fries were pretty goodI was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone  Thankfully our server did a nice jobI understand its a chain and pretty standardized everywhere you go but I found this location to be especially bad First when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant nothing visibly dirty but smells like the entire joint needs degreased Second the service the host was a typical younger girl efficient without too much professionalism not a big deal The waitress a professional  but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along  Our food took a long time and she saved herself by telling us that she didnt know why our food wasnt ready yet but would check again and of course hot plates with lukewarm food came out soon after She reeked of cigarette smoke so im going to make a dumb assumption and guess thats where she was  The food typical TGIfridays food good enough for a chain restaurant  Extremely unlikely that id returnMy experience at this Fridays was not what I was expecting I am always looking for new Fridays locations to eat at This one made me want to toss the warm beer the bartender gave me right in their faceAnytime I go to a Fridays I order one tall glass of the best beer in America Bud Light This beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold Well like I said above the bartender gave me a warm glass of beer and it was not my Bud Light it was a dumb craft beerWhat is a craft beer Why was my beer warm Better than that why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer I did not find this funny at allI had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order The food tasted frozen and microwaved Nothing special just around average"

    "review":"If I had to pick one thing that I missed most about Pittsburgh it would be Pamelas I love breakfast and they do it right I do think that this is the best location after breakfast or brunch you can stroll through Shadyside Sometimes you do have to wait but its never been outrageous and Im not sure if Ive ever had anything I didnt like  My husband prefers the Oakland location but Shadyside is my pick  Its because of the shopping I wont lieOh my goodness I absolutely love this place Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious Absolutely delicious food meltinyour mouth lyonnaise potatoes and crepelike pancakes  Its tiny cheekbyjowl and often a long line on the weekends but worth the wait and the cashonly inconvenienceI cant speak to anything but the breakfast food since Ive never been able to get past itMy husband and I who lived within walking distance or waddling distance when leaving to go home would normally split a hotcake special with the ham and cheese omelet  That way we each could get eggs meat pancake and potato cravings fulfilled  When I went without him I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake regular  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry  dont be afraid by the sour cream ingredient  It tastes AMAZING and not too rich any richer with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfastTheir hot cocoa is probably from the package but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on topI once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table  If he and Obama eat their hearts out here youll do fine  Come try it alreadyA great independent eatery  They have breakfasts of all description freshly made and quite enormous at reasonable prices  Bring a big appetite  Their omelots will fill you to bursting even if you dont eat the huge slices of bread and hash browns that come with them  And  hey the coffee is good tooWe go to Pittsburgh maybe twice a year and we always try to go Pamelas every trip  This place fills up very quickly and I remember often having to line up to get inOne of the first things you will notice is that there is a photo of Obama at the cash register right out front  Some things to point out before I get to the food is that the washrooms are upstairs through the South American restaurant that shares the same building  Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no rearranging for larger parties  This place only accepts cash unless theyve changed that from the last time I was there its always been like this at least for this locationThe tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast hash etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possibleNow to the food  Its damn good period  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pams special  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach maybe because the portions can be bigI prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself their pancakes the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy  We usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon tooThe place has packed for a reason and theyre not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood  When locals pack a place consistently the reason is simple the place is This restaurant has quality food in a great neighborhood"

    "review":"fun place food is cheap and delicious so many choices and the sushi rolls are so funDisappointed at the fact that they didnt have chips or ice cream for milkshakes Its a hot day you would think you wouldnt run out of ice cream Also didnt understand why there was a 8 minimum on credit cards when thats never happened before to meGreat little place Simple but cheap meal out Yes you can make a pb and j at home but here they will do all sorts of cool things with it Its about 4 dollars a meal so if you want a cheap treat its fun  Excellent for parent child dates Only complaints It was hot in there Warmer than outside  I also prefer a higher quality jellyjam  But it was still goodTasty sandwiches nice selection good value good service liked the Elvis and the Red Raz RollYoud think pbj was overdone after eating it every day for lunch in grade school but youd be wrong Menu is quite varied and very affordable Staff was very friendly Will definitely be coming back to try some of the more adventurous itemsI was looking for a quick snack and Peanut Butter Jelly Time definitely fit the bill  Sure peanut butter and jelly isnt the fanciest meal but the sushi rolls elevated the common sandwich its even served with chop sticks  The staff was friendly and the hot chocolate was delicious too  A nice treat for a good price  Its fun to try different combinations without having to buy all the ingredients to experiment at home"

    "review":"Good pizza at a great price The unique crust thats both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody but our whole group liked it The sauce is good too light but with a good tomato flavor The best thing about this place is the management They went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast And the prices: we fed everybody in under 40 with plenty of leftovers taken homeExcellent family owned pizza spot The owners are so nice and always accommodating The food is great and always what we expect My daughter loves that they have tv in the dining area The outside patio is decorated very well and its nice to sit outside for a few after you fill up on pizza Great staff great food would recommend to anyoneI have eaten here my whole life Great people and great food I highly recommend their Italian hoagies Its the only place I will eat one from  All the food is delicious thoughUnderated and ignored  if you see this ol time pizzaria near Kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style  Better then DiSallas  the only thing I can say that is better then Latinas is Mineos   they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments  Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon  To just enjoy with yourself and a friendI have to admit the first time I hate here I absolutely hated the pizza And I think it was because I was expecting something completely different than I got Latina Pizza is very different from most pizza shops Instead if a round thin crust pizza this pizza is square thick and doughy The crust is not really that good but that is not why you get a pizza here Its the homemade sauce And that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive The other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to Kennywood So usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks No lines no waiting for tables no outrageous prices Its a time to recharge and sometimes we feel like going back to the park  other times we decide to go home"

    "review":"My salad was a mix of kale mesclun and spinach with four ingredients of my choice Lots of options to build a custom salad If you dont feel like building your own they have a separate menu of salads to choose from Service was quick and salad was delishIf you are looking for a very tasty and fresh salad get in and get out  this is your place If you are looking for friendly service with a smile go somewhere elseI stopped in because it is close to my office When I said it was my first time there I was given a very thorough runthrough of how ordering works which was nice However despite the fact that I was the only one there everyone seemed a bit stressed and literally no smiles Call me entitled but I like to feel as though my business is appreciated and there again having announced that it was my first time there it would have been nice to get some smiles and maybe a come back soon Instead my salad was tossed in the bag and I was essentially rushed a long So thats that I may go back if I need a good salad in a hurry but probably wont become a regularThis place is awesome and has great service I usually make my own salad: pick my own greens and 4 fresh toppings for less than 7  As an added bonus you can get a free slice of delicious whole grain bread with it Its just a great deal that fills me up and satisfies my occasional need for a healthy lunch  Thanks for being an oasis of fresh food downtownI must be a glutton for punishment because I just keep coming back  This time may very well be the last  I ordered their E tu Brute and there seems to be some type of unpleasant crunching within the salad as if there were sand on the kale or spinach  I would like to assume it was washed but Im not convinced  However the over arching problem with this place is the absolute and complete lack of consistency  I found myself praying to not get certain employees to assemble my salad because they would come out horribly bad  Usually drenched in salad dressing or next to none skimping on ingredients etc  I think they need to work to train their employees in order to offer a more consistent product  The biggest issue is the salad dressing  what does light medium or heavy mean  Well it could either be entirely the same or completely different depending on what employee you get to make your salad  Also most not all of the employees need an attitude adjustment  This indicates to me that management is lacking  Please train people  and supervise  them appropriatelyIve walked past Earth Inspired so many times and have always wanted to go in Today I decided to go for it and was really happy with the experience All of the staff was really friendly and helpful I ordered a Thai one on salad and it was delicious The salad comes with mixed greens carrot radish seaweed salad shrimp and spicy broccoli im not a big broccoli fan and they let me sub some edamame instead The veggies were very fresh and the shrimp was delicious I have seen some people discuss the price but I felt 10 was fair for how much food I got The miso dressing was a little bit oilier than what I would like but overall the salad was great It also came with a tasty slice of multi grain bread in which my thighs told me to avoid but I was happy I didnt listen It was very hardy and full of yummy seeds  I will definitely be back to try more of their salads You can also make your own and there are tons of toppings to choose from Very pleasedI was looking for a place to get a salad downtown while visiting Pittsburgh and found this place I chose to select my own ingredients I started with their mesclun greens and added chickpeas diced beets red onions sunflower seeds goat cheese and a sliced hardboiled egg They offered me samples of their dressings and I chose the Dijon vinaigrette The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavorful I am something of a salad connoisseur and have salad for lunch often This was the best salad I have had in recent memory The total price was a little under 10 and the serving size was perfect My appetite was satisfied for the whole afternoon Finally the service was awesome The guys working there were friendly and attentive and gave the place a nice atmosphere The decor is also bright and cheerful To me the price seems right considering the quality of the food and the service Note that I do not give 5star reviews lightly but this place deserves it"

    "review":"UPDATE: We went back here after a week much better experience no soup spilled and they had beer The manager Wayne remembered me from the previous visit and asked about the soup so that was a good start I had the Jerk grilled cheese this time it was advertised as spicy so I was a little worried but there wasnt much heat to it at all I didnt like the fact that the pork was hot and the pineapple was cold It would have made a huge difference if they heated up the pineapple prior to putting it on the sandwich but it was good Big beer selection good food and good service The below review was from my first trip read if you dareDont cry over spilled soup We went out to this new location in Market Square on the day that they opened around 11:30 Immediate disappointment ensued when they werent able to sell alcohol yet we were told they would have their liquor license straightened out by 4 for happy hour We dont need alcohol to have a good time but they had the 36 draft system right in front of us so it was just a big tease Anyway the menu had some very interesting names on it for the grilled cheese sandwiches I went with the smack yo mama a grilled cheese with caribbean chicken and jack cheese After waiting a little while the food arrivedbut as it arrived the server spilled a whole cup of their tomato soup all over my jeansshoes Their serving plates were just wooden rectangles with handles  no lips or indentations for the soup or chip cups to stay on the board  I dont blame the server I blame the one who settled on these as a good idea to serve hot soup on I was less than amused but the manager came over and said he would comp my meal  which ended up being fine since the soup came outWhat gets better or worse  the one bartender poured a bottled beer Evil Genius  Evil Eye PA into a glass gave it to the manager who served it to a gentleman at a different table I asked if we were able to purchase bottles was told no then asked why they served a bottle him They told me the bottle was for the cook to make their beer cheese out of We could clearly see the gentleman at the table drinking the beer and the bartender denied ever opening it Dont know why he could have one but nobody else could but it doesnt look good as a business for you to do that in front of customers and its even worse if its illegal for you to do thatLong story short  this was just not a good lunch the service was great from the bartender and I do feel bad for the server but it was just not a good experience Maybe give this place some time for them to sort out the kinks and Ill edit this reviewI LOVE grilled cheese sandwiches in fact during my entire pregnancy I craved grilled cheese sandwiches and I made my husband go here often  Our most recent visit was to market square over the weekend and it didnt disappoint  One of my favorites is the big chebowski which is what I got  It is served on texas toast with gouda cheese bacon fried egg and tomato  The fried egg really makes the grilled cheeseas soon as you bite into it or cut it in half as I do the yolk  breaks and makes for a great dip and just adds another dimension to the sandwich  Ive also had the poppin my collar and that is equally as good  I actually turned my husband onto poppin my collar which is what he got  If you like a little spice this is perfect  I know shrimp on a grilled cheese sounds odd but I assure you this will not disappoint  After looking at the appetizers we finally decided on the yard poutine the pub pretzels and mac attack were our other choices which are both very good  It was delicious a bit messy so eat with a fork  They give you a nice portion and its big enough to share with 24 people  The servers are all very nice and friendly they dont hover over you like some places but they make sure that you are taken care of  I would highly recommend The Yard Market Square if youre in the mood for a good grilled cheese and a good beerWorst service Ive ever had Food was over cooked Mimosas were made completely out of orange juice We had a reservation and paid for unlimited mimosas but they told us they had another party coming at two and kicked us out Will never come backWas really loud for Brunch Not sure if the Mimosas had any champaign at all My Caprese Omelet did not have any basil in it at all The French toast my friend had was fantastic as was our waitressThe menu is unique and interesting Not to mention delicious Our server Michael was excellent He was entertaining and very knowledgable about the menu The food looked as delicious as it sounds on the menuLoved the grilled cheese selection  they have 36 beers on tap too Server Jess was very pleasant Def recommend"

    "review":"Literally just hung up on some asshole who clearly cant operate a telephone Even Hellen Keller had that position RIDICULOUSI order from this Papa Johns location twice a month or more on average I usually use the phone app to place the order and pick up the order myself carryout not delivery I have found this location to meet my expectations although I have to admit that my standards arent terribly high for this kind of establishment if they give me what I order in a manner that is pleasant in the time frame they said then I am happy In my experience my pizza is ready when my confirmation email has said it would be usually 15 to 25 minutes The pizza is hot and made with the correct toppings I usually order a one topping large half with mushrooms and the other half plain cheese The quality of the ingredients is good The pizza I receive seem to be reasonably carefully made since the crust around the edge is usually a consistent thickness all the pieces have sauce and cheese and the pizza is cut so the mushrooms are on half of the pieces and plain cheese on the other half Sometimes some pieces are larger than others but since the pizza is cut by hand that can sometimes happen Once my pizza pieces werent cut all the way through which made for a somewhat messy pizza since the pieces had to be torn off or recut to come apart cleanly The staff has always been perfectly pleasant to meI give my name and they give me my pizza If I walk in and the staff member is in another part of the store he or she usually comes over to help me relatively quickly If I paid through the app they say I am all set to go or if I choose cash they tell me the total and ring me out In my experience with carryout pizza this Papa Johns location performs wellTerrible service I ordered 3 pizzas and the Works one didnt have any meat on it This was going to be for friends who are helping us move so I called  talked to the manager He was curt rude Well did you eat it already and told me that I had to drive back in with the pizza to get a replacement No refund no effort to make up for the mistake They should have at least delivered another for free Not ordering from here againDarrens a dootiehead again I found nothing wrong with their pizza or wingsI ordered a pizza from this papa johns Gave my address and waited for the pizza to be delivered 20 minutes later I received a phone call saying they dont deliver to my address 3 miles away when I complained about not being told that when I ordered the manager hung up on me Horrible customer serviceIf you have a burning desire to be talked to like a piece of garbage by a pimplyfaced teen boy on a power trip by all means give this Papa Johns a tryWe made an online order of pizza and breadsticks Nothing difficult Its Sunday No Steelers Pirates or Pens game Cant be that busy Our email confirmation said 3040 minutes After an hour we call The order is on its way this kid says A half an hour after that we call The same kid explains that the driver got stuck at another location but assured us he was on his way now After another 15 minutes we call again and cancel the order because at this point our food had been cold for well over 45 minutesThe kid was such a snot that Im still upset about it I hope one day he grows up and becomes a contributing member of society If you like being treated like a valued customer I would steer clear of this place Off to grab my take order from Slice on Broadway"

    "review":"Terrible experience both times I have been there I ordered take out one rainy night she told me 20 minutes and when I showed up they acted like I had never called but my order slip was on the counter I waited while they made my order I decided to give them another shot last Friday and went with a bunch of my girlfriends We got there and were seated promptly We rbought a bottle of wine which had a corking fee of 15 I was surprised but since they had a full bar I understood It took 20 minutes to get us wine glasses and then another 20 before our server took our order Our server apologized for the delay because they were hosting a large group upstairs I let it slide then We got ordered and waited 45 minutes for our food and our orders were wrong It took us approximately 10 minutes to eat since we were so hungry We then waited another 35 minutes for our check Overall the menu is great I enjoyed my food but it was not good enough to tolerate that service again Youll see me at Little Tokyo next timeThis is the first time Ive eaten here and Ive heard mixed reviews We ordered a sushi boat so we figured wed get a nice assortment of different rolls and sashimi The presentation was ok but the sushi was sub par The tuna roll  a very basic roll that is standard everywhere and thus should be pretty hard to get wrong was no good The fish had a strange taste to it A few of the other pieces were not very good Overall it just wasnt very good The whole thing was 50 which isnt terrible for two people but really was not worth it To top it all off the waitress was pretty rude and the staff was not welcoming at all I will not be backWe got the sushi boat which came with an assortment of sashimi sushi california rolls and tuna rolls and started off with miso soup and salad with ginger dressing Im sure the dressing had a mayonnaise base which is fine but I wish the taste of ginger was stronger Our miso soup was warm not hot The sushi rolls were not very good at all The sushi was alright and while some of the sashimi was delicious the rest of it was mediocre I hate to leave such a harsh critique because the people working there seemed very nice but based on the food alone I will not be going backGreat lunch  3rd time in the last 2months and same great experience each time  Great value as well  as the lunch for two was quite reasonableWe go there every other month and enjoy ourselves but our recent delivery experience was so horrible that I may never returnWe ordered in for a house party  The food did not come for two hours after numerous phone calls to see what was happening  Every time they assured us that the delivery boy had just left a dubious assertion to give twice thirty minutes apart  The food came soggy and warm  No offers of discount or any other recourse were given except to reduce the tip to the poor guy working for themWent there on my break from Steel Cactus Got in and out really fast Really good sushi Waitress was super nice and she handled all her tables well even though the restaurant was busy Definitely be back there for more"

    "review":"This is about the 7th Primanti Bros location I have been to and Id rank this as one of my favorites Love the location on the Southside There are a lot of places to check out around the area and Primantis is the perfect place to start you bar crawl with a tasty sandwich Regardless of what you get it is coming with Coleslaw Tomato and fries If you dont like that then its best to know their lingo  For example if you dont want the coleslaw order your sandwich with no grass If you you just say no coleslaw you might get some strange looks Luckily I like it all  Ive worked my way through most of the sandwiches and the Capicola and Cheese w Egg is my favorite but this time I tried on of their limited sandwiches called the When Pigs Fly It had a huge pile of Ham and Bacon with Egg along with the other usual suspects Excellent with some hot sauce added  We also shared a order of the Loaded Nachos which were top notch  You really cant go wrong here Get an Iron City beer to go with your meal and you will be sitting pretty  I will say this location is one of the smaller ones so seating is limited but we had no problem on a Friday night around 7:30p The staff here were friendly and attentive so that coupled with excellent food is a winwin in my bookAfter a night at the bars in this area some fries and burgers will always be fucking bomb So this place is supposedly a must go in Pittsburgh So here I am The burger meat is ok Not the highest quality the bread was not toasted which was different but very good Their thing here is to put fries and cole slaw in their burgers It adds an additional layer of flavor and texture to the food I wish the ingredients were higher quality but for 689 what can you really expect The bartender is really super friendly and nice Cool chill spotI went to the Primantis on South Side for lunch on a Monday  I actually wasnt planning on going to South Side but I got lost navigating through Oakland and ended up on a bridge  Typical Clevelander trying to navigate the burgh Figuring that I had to at least try this Pittsburgh tradition before leaving town I stopped byService was prompt and on cue  I ordered the cheese combo sandwich which was two slices of thick white break containing a mound of coleslaw largecut fries and melted cheese  The sandwich was ridiculously large as expected and very filling though became kind of overwhelming after a few bites  The taste was good but nothing to write home about in my honest opinion  I personally find that the large amount of coleslaw kind of overpowers the sandwich  The bread got soggy pretty quick and became less appetizing by the minute  Who knows maybe youll enjoy it  Give it a shot if you havent experienced it before  Just wasnt quite for meFemale night bartender is incredibly rude and acts like it physically hurts her to wait on you and barely speaks Not the customer service Im looking for while having a casual beer Also the staff is not so sneaky about taking shots while ON the clock togetherThis place was good and was what I was expecting for a Pittsburgh food staple I had the burger sandwich which was the 2 best selling sandwich The coleslaw was tangy and the fries tasted good This particular location had primarily sandwiches and a full bar The other main location has more of an extensive menu Not a bad place to grab a sandwich for a not so expensive price to start off a night of bar hopingPittsburgher Cheesesteak the number 2 best seller one would think  would be amazingThis was a place my husband found and thought since it is a Pittsburgh institution with locations all over the city it must be goodComing in to the bar area they sent us to the back right away since the bar is smoking and not for kidsThe back not so niceI was over it and the man got the cheesesteak for 9 and if you see the picture once he unwrapped it was like WTFNot very large or innovative the steak a burger like patty sure it had fries cheese and coleslaw my fav part of the sandwich tasted more sauerkraut like but overall just not as stellar as hopedService is fast atmosphere kind of dingy not really worth the stop or the money"

    "review":"Ive lived in PIttsburgh most of my life and have gone to the Carnegie zillions of times I had never been to this cafe though When you go in on of the entrances of the Museum of Art it will be in front of the large glass window facing Forbes Ave and the fountain You can pick up sandwiches and cold foods from the cases or order hot food at the register Their menu very pretty diverse so its good for all ages Its cafeteria style unless you order hot If you order hot food they bring it to the table Meals are under 10My favorite item is their salmon cake with asparagus and wild rice It was amazing The best I ever hadThe boy and I were visiting his brother and sisterinlaw who have recently moved to Pittsburg  During our daylong visit to the Carnegie Museums we decided to stop and have lunch here rather than wander the city looking for food  The boy had the steak sandwich which he said was a little greasy but yummy  I had the petite salad and mushroom soup it came with a cute little bread bun  The salad was prettily presented but the carrot curlicues were very challenging to eat gracefully  The soup was very good and the combo only cost 5We sat by the window which presented a nice view of the fountain and the streetThis is inside the Carnegie Art Museum but outside the paid area  Although very crowded it was surprisingly quick  Order at a counter pick up your drink pay and they bring the meal to your table  Small menu light stuff but fast and good  I had a cajun shrimp salad the daily special that day crunchy lettuce decorated with the mediumsized wellspiced shrimp  Definitely a satisfying light mealThey need more veggie options  I asked for the fontina and spinach quiche which sounded delicious  A few moments after I ordered the staff told me they were out  They were apologetic but the only other veggie options were salads and yuck a garden burger  I ended up disappointed and having to find somewhere else to get foodThis is a great lunch place for us nonstudents working in Oakland The atmosphere is relaxed and the service which now includes cleaning off tables is friendly and nonchalant Plus you can always check out the museum store for gift ideas The food is okay It can be hit or miss The crab sandwich I had recently was exactly what I was looking for that day and I really enjoy their broccolibacon side dish However their weekly quiche is on the dry side and sometimes the salads are a bit of a let down Ill definitely be back its always a solid optionYoud be hard pressed to find a classier venue for lunch in the Oakland area than the Carnegie Cafe  Located in the front entrance of the Carnegie Museum of Art the cafe overlooks the fountain and well Forbes Avenue  But its serene and lovely and you feel just a little fancy hereExcept that the service is cafeteria style  So you order grab a tray and go do the line and pay at the end  Oh and you pick up an empty cup and get yourself a soda  Kinda takes away from the ambiance  Nice lunch options and the prices are reasonable  I had a half sandwich ham brie on a cute little biscuit and a bowl of soup asparagus and a drink iced tea and I think it came to about 11  While you order and pay in a cafeteria style environment the food is cooked to order and then served to your table by wait staffIm not going to dine here everyday for lunch because Im just not that fancy and there are so many options for lunch in Oakland  However I will come here frequently and sit and watch the fountains and enjoy the environment"

    "review":"Had a good dinner with friends here  Definitely Americanized versions of Greek dishes but any changes they made to traditional recipes still tasted really good  Also excellent for bringing home a dish for lunch the next dayThe food is absolutely homemade except you didnt have to make it Try the Dakos Salata Spanakopita to die for Gyro of the Day just about anything We have become regulars here You cannot beat it So very goodThe guy was really nice He introduced us to cheese and honey He used the same pitcher that my mom got me for some special day In this way  we connected Bless this man and his Greek yoghurt which is YOG  HURTThis was my first meal from Pastitsios and it was AMAZINGI had a pork gyro and a greek salad  Without a doubt they were the freshest ingredients and the flavor was incredible TOP NOTCH  I would suggest everyone try PastitsiosGreat Greek food  This small restaurant is casual and the adjoining kitchen was spotless There is also a patio dining area for warm weather My friends and I dined here and found it to have delicious food a BYOB policy and great service Christina was efficient  friendly  We started out with stuffed grape leaves which we all thought were the best we ever tasted Next came the hummus with pita bread Again we rated this as the best ever Then we tasted the spanakopita which was so good we could have had it for our main dish We all ordered the skewered lamb served on a small bed of rice Very nice seasoning We met the owner Matt who was courteous and very pleased with our rave reviews on his food This restaurant has great food and a friendly atmosphereA friend and I traveled from the South Hills to try Pastitsio at Pastitsio restaurant We ordered our beverages and an appetizer My friend had the olive and cheese plate and I ordered the hummus It did take a while for drinks and then appetizers to come out but it was a nice day and we were sitting outside We ordered our entrees then my friend ordered the lamb and rice the waiter said they were serving it on Tabellah today not rice she said that was fine I ordered the Pastitsio  My friend liked her appetizer but I did not like the hummus it was not smooth and creamy but grainy with no taste and had about a tablespoon of paprika dumped on top of it Then the waiter came out about 10 minutes later and told me they were OUT of Pastitsio and would I like to order something else Well no I came for Pastitsio It was Wed afternoon the name of the restaurant was Pastitsio  Duh why would I want something else and how did you run out of it in the middle of the afternoon I left more than half of the hummus and gave the Pita to my friend My friends entre did not come served on Tabellah it was served on rice  Not traveling there again If anyone wants good Greek Lasagna go to the Greentree Farmers Market There is a wonderful Greek food Booth with Pastitsio Mousakka pastries and other good food I will be trying"

    "review":"The food is well prepared fresh Belgian standards Theres obviously a solid commitment to quality of preparation and ingredients The dishes are largely unchallenging mussels steak frite chicken breast and the only time the quality of the food dips is when they stray into slightly more imaginative territory THE FRIES WILL ELEVATE YOUR SPIRIT TO A WORLD OF PURE FATTY BLISS Their brunch menu is great with a wide range of good options and a nice prefixe menu that comes with an entree side and a brunch cocktail The brunch poutine will also keep you full for a week Be sure to arrive right at opening or several hours after opening for brunch or youll be in line foreverLast night was maybe my fourth time at Park Bruges and they have all been great experiences The menu is nearly identical to its Point Breeze sibling which I also love Overall I think I prefer Point Brugge but I cant exactly pinpoint the reason Maybe my experiences have been just a bit better there It could also be because the restaurant is a block from my house Anyway Park Bruges offers a mix of sandwiches salads and larger entrees Two other items they are known for are poutine and mussels I have had mussels at Point Brugge and they were great so I would imagine the same would be true here On my most recent trip last night I had the flat iron steak salad which was delicious In addition to the juicy mediumrare steak the salad came complete with bleu cheese tomatoes herbed potatoes and a champagne vinaigrette Totally awesome In the past I have also had some of their pasta dishes which have all been excellent as well Dessert items vary but last night we had a flourless cake with raspberry mousse filling and while one slice is large enough to share I could have eaten literally the entire cake It was that good Service has always been great too Definitely check this place out if youre in the areaI would actually rate this more at a 35 and rounded up Had the veggie burger it was good Not spectacular but a very good one CheersOoooh my Gosh Amaziing Brunch The Baked Banana Walnut Spiced Rum Crme anglaise stuffed French toast blew my socks off The slow Roasted Beef Brisket Potato Hash with sunny side up eggs Gouda cheese  Horseradish Cream was extra tasty and delish Eat it No regrets Very happy taste buds and belly Great Bloody Mary to top it off I scoped out Everyone elses plates I could see and they all looked wonderful I live in the neighborhood  This has been a great addition to the neighborhood  It definitely has the feel of a neighborhood restaurant  It reminds me in that way of an Irish pub except the food is much better   And the beer list is better  Which is saying a lotIts also a destination restaurant  People drive in from all over to eat hereIts casual  Its friendly  It has an upbeat atmosphere  And the food is really goodHighly recommendedNice restaurant with an interesting assortment of menu items I recommend the poutine or the roast beef sandwich"

    "review":"Food is greatdelicious Environment on point clean energetic friendly Only thing is a little unorganized  Yes very busy as the wait time was a while but understandable as it was a game day they use an app to tell your place in line Im a fan : but once seated the friendly server took our order app came out fast before our drinks and no app platesand not with our other app we ordered But once we tasted it all absolutely delish Definitely be back in the futureMy mom and I were spending a girls night out and decided to check out this restaurant prior to the Pirate game  We planned ahead and got in line via No Wait as I anticipated this being a popular spot on a Friday night  We arrived at the restaurant and I checked in as the app instructed me to do  The hostesses seemed overwhelmed already it was only 5 pm and not one of them politely greeted us  One asked me if I selected indoor outdoor or no preference when I registered online  I said Im sorry I didnt as that wasnt an option when I got in line  She looked super annoyed rolled her eyes and said Thats what Im asking you So I apologized again something wrong with this picture here and requested outside  At that point there were four parties ahead of us  We waited another 15 minutes before our table was ready  Once we were alerted I returned to the hostess desk informed them that my table was ready  At this point there were 4 employees standing at the desk not busy serving other customers  One said you have to now check in with the outside host desk  Having never been there before I did not know where that was exactly so I asked if someone could show us  One employee also seemingly annoyed Im sensing a pattern here lifted his arm and literally pointed at the front door  Incredulous I said I needed someone to physically show me the way  not point outside  We were then  directed outside to the appropriate area and the next hostess was far friendlier and lead us promotly to our table  The table wasnt actually ready as there was still debris and remnants from the previous diners  So the hostess bussed the table and we settled in  At this point it was 1 hour and 45 minutes prior to the start of the game  plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful weather  We were greeted fairly promptly by our waitress she was very friendly and our drink orders were taken  We acknowledged that we were going to the game  It took a solid 15 minutes for her to return with our drinks and take our dinner order  She apologized for the wait and we said no problem because at the point we had the whole night ahead of us  That turned out to be the shortest wait of the evening  And our waitress became less pleasant and present from that point forwardWe ordered three apps total and a salad  Our first two appetizers arrived 30 minutes later  and at that point our glasses were bone dry  We asked for water which took another 15 minutes  Its important to note that while the restaurant was somewhat busy not all of the tables were occupied in our area and it appeared to be well staffed  It took another 35 minutes to receive our dinner remember a salad and an appetizer of tacos and we were starting to get very annoyed  My moms salad came without dressing so the waitress went back to retrieve it  Not sure if she got lost but that took an unnecessarily long time as well  Unfortunately the game was fast approaching so we hurriedly ate not at all how we envisioned this going and asked for the check  We also asked for a take out box as the portions were very generous  Our waitress served two tables going in and out before finally bringing us our check Guess what no box  She served two more tables in and out before taking our check and bringing boxes  At this point we were 5 minutes from game time very frustrated and certainly not relaxed  The food at Jerome Bettis Grille 36 was tasty and generously portioned  However the staff was hugely disappointing from the moment we walked in to the moment we hurriedly rushed out  Despite being well staffed it appeared disorganized and poorly managed  The host staff was incredibley rude and the wait staff was not attentive or responsive to our very basic needs  I will not return to this restaurant for future pregame meals nor would I recommend it to anyone interested in spending their time wisely  Jerome  the city loves you and we are proud of you but your restaurant staff is letting you down  I cant imagine these are your standards and you are going to need to act quickly to turn this around before the next influx of sports fans unknowingly settles inAlso as a huge Steeler fan I was expecting more  Nothing special here food was decent  Service was slow  I wouldnt recommend going out of your way to come here  This restaurant is pretty much the same as the Indianapolis Colts Grille owned by the same groupThis place is owned by The Bus from my favorite team THE STEELERS and he is from Michigan where I currently live so know I had to check it out  Enjoyed this place It is right off of the waterfront in downtown Pittsburgh It has TVs in every location of the restaurant and has outdoor sighting with a good view of the riverfront The food was ok but if you are a sports fan it  is definitely the place to be Parking is across the street and convenientThis place has a great location next to Hines Field I came in hungry and still hungover from the night before and they help fix both issues  We had bloody marys that hit the spot and I had short rib tacos that were pretty good  My wife a club sandwich  that was very good They sell Bettis Items and have TVs everywhere  Get there early on game day because it will get packedCame here on a Pirates game day about 2 hours before the game Luckily we found some seats at the bar to eat  drink the wait for a table was over a hour We ordered a few appetizers and beers It only took about 1520 min to get our food I thought much longer since their wait was so long Our waitress was on top of everything our glasses never were empty Food was aright pretzel sticks were AMAZING get those if youre getting a app The bones less wings are really not wings but chicken tenders with wing sauce Buffalo chicken flat bread was good THEY HAVE BANANA BREAD BEER GET IT The inside of the restaurant is obviously sports themed LOUD atmosphere there were children there its family friendly if you want to bring your kid to a bar  Bathrooms are ok little dark"

    "review":"I was visiting a friend and we walked from her house down to the Square Cafe for breakfast one morning Yum The coffee was in big square pottery mugs the food was delicious and the prices are reasonable Their website says theyre only open for breakfast and lunch and that they close at 3 dailyIt really is about as good as it gets as far as breakfast joints go in Pittsburgh  We often dont enjoy eating out for breakfast for the simple reason its often nothing special  Square Cafe is a refreshing change of course  They have the breakfast staples yet manage to execute them better  Not greasy always fresh and always leave happy  They do a lot of twists to make things more interesting  My personal favorite are their takes on eggs Benedict  Their summer menu had it made with beef short ribs and side of salad greens  The fall version uses crab cakes with a side of salad greens  It is a perfect breakfast tasty hardy but not overwhelming  Their crepes pancakes and anything they do with smoked salmon are also great  They have brew a great cup of coffee as well  Their breakfast prices are somewhat more than some other establishments but its worth it  We always leave feeling that we made a right choice for breakfastGreat coffee Great staff  Great ingredients and inventive menu Prices are higher because of thisbut considering the above they are worth itIm giving it five stars because of the ambiance I walked in and was immediately greeted It was packed full of people who seemed very pleased Probably a lot of regulars Very clean and hip They have outdoor seating and good iced coffee The workers were very nice I didnt get the chance to eat here because I already had breakfast but I plan to come back the next time Im in town Theres a getgo gas station at the corner and a theatre and several shops Nice neighborhoodExtremely underwhelming My Brussels sprout hash was hardly cooked The mushrooms and Brussels sprouts were nearly raw and had no flavor DisappointingSquare Caf was recommended as the best place in Pittsburgh for breakfast so expectations were extremely high especially with so many other really good breakfast options in the area Unfortunately my experience here did not live up to those expectations My meal was good and my guests enjoyed their meal as well The staff was friendly and helpful Perhaps some of my disappointment is with the menu which is what I would classify as too avantgarde for what I was looking for this particular morning At breakfast I prefer the traditional favorites while this menu focuses on some really experimental flavors For me I would find this place more enjoyable at lunch rather than dinner"

    "review":"Met up with this truck at the coffee Buddha food truck Roundup Had to try their unique version of an ice cream cone called Barbacone They use a waffle cone place macaroni and cheese in the bottom next pulled pork  and then topped with coleslaw It is a complete barbecue meal in an easy to hold cone The only problem that we had with this interesting concoction was that we let it sleep in the box too long and it became a bit soggy Totally our fault so we would like to try it again fresh out of the truck He also got the three giant barbecued wings They were tender and the char was perfect Im sure Ill be buying these every time I see this truck Can forward to our next food rendezvousI love the South Side BBQ Company I used to grab lunch from the truck every Friday I could when they would park near my office building I miss it and wish they were able to come back Ive ordered the Redneck Club and Pulled Pork sandwiches multiple times and both are delicious The pulled pork in particular has the perfect texture with larger chunks of meat and smaller shredded pieces mixed evenly throughout The coleslaw and sauces are also thin and taste more vinegarbased which is my favorite style of BBQ Ive never been a fan of thick overly sweet BBQ sauce or viscous coleslaw The owners also seem like really awesome guys so it was always a pleasure giving them my business Im excited to see theyre still doing events around the city and Ill for sure track them down next time theyre in my neck of the woodsWhat to say about South Side BBQ Ive eaten bbq ribs all over this country especially In the southern states and a lot of rib cookoffs but south side bbq has them all beat The ribs were done to perfection  all the sides are al a cart I had half a rack of ribs carolina coleslaw and bake beans the price was minimum but the best bbq around No its not a truck Little place off Carson st Went on Wednesday wing day 1 full sized smoked wings They were awesome I got the lobster Mac and cheese dish and it was good The staff and owner were great You must visit this place on WednesdaysI went for the first time today I had a half rack of ribs and the ghost pepper macncheese The ribs had a good flavor but they were definitely not the best Ive ever had The meat was not falling off the bone and they were fairly fatty The macncheese was good but other than having some heat it wasnt anything spectacular in terms of flavor I would order it again if I go because I do like hot foods I may go back and give their wings a try because they do make a tasty sauce Im not sure I would order the ribs again It has a nice casual atmosphere and the guy working was very friendlyMet up with this truck at the coffee Buddha food truck Roundup Had to try their unique version of an ice cream cone called Barbacone They use a waffle cone place macaroni and cheese in the bottom next pulled pork  and then topped with coleslaw It is a complete barbecue meal in an easy to hold cone The only problem that we had with this interesting concoction was that we let it sleep in the box too long and it became a bit soggy Totally our fault so we would like to try it again fresh out of the truck We also got the three giant barbecued wings They were tender and the char was perfect Im sure Ill be buying these every time I see this truck Looking forward to our next food rendezvous"

    "review":"Full disclosure: Im not a big fan of Chinese to begin with but my partner wanted to grab a quick lunch here She had a cup of corn and chicken soup I the egg drop soup When they came we made sure that our server hadnt mistakenly given us the bowl size She hadnt In some places a cup of soup is usually about two shots worth but at Wai Wai the cup is a very generous portion I found the soup the best part of the meal though it was probably nothing more than cheap chicken broth and shredded egg whites The pot of jasmine tea was average and could have used a bit more flavor We shared an order of the honey chicken again generously portioned I realize in a place like Wai Wai raising questions about MSG as well as whether or not their meat is locally sourced andor humanely raised and thus healthy for the consumer are somewhat unreasonable even absurd queries to posit While my partner and I do care about food awareness and personal health by choosing to eat here I suppose we tacitly approved of sloughing off such concerns and slumming it for a meal All this being said the mound of honey chicken surrounded by a ring of steamed broccoli and individual sides of rice were uninspiring I took a few bites and didnt feel the urge to have anymore Yeah my aforementioned ethical concerns were the root cause of this but the food was very middling There was nothing terrible about it but it was just your typical Americanized unhealthy Chinese food The server was attentive and friendly we tipped accordingly I wouldnt go out of my to dissuade the reader from going if he or she is a fan of standard Chinese fare but I highly doubt Ill find myself in there againThe most reliable Chinese take out around  Have ordered here many times and am always satisfied Prices are great and the staff are some of the most pleasant people They tell you it will be 2030 mins but Ive had my food at my door in less than 10 mins at timesIts a nice looking restaurant with standard AmericanChinese fare I just prefer other places Nice decor and pretty good service thoughFood tastes great  Dinner boxes are a steal  Oh and they have the fastest delivery aroundThe service has always been not so great to say the least but the last time we went it was so bad that it was almost comical The waitress didnt pay any attention to us for about 10 minutes even though not much was going on there When I got up to get her she overthetop apologized first saying that she thought the other waitress had us and then a minute later saying that she forgot she hadnt brought us water yet This pattern of lying repeated itself when my husband got the wrong order and when she disappeared out of the restaurant for extensive periods of time about 3 times First she had one reason then another By the end we were both really pissed off and my husband told her that he doesnt care about the why I did feel bad for her but she did ruin our dinner We havent been back since and wont ever be again even though it used to be my favorite spot to grab dinnerKeeping in mind that the service has always been iffy and certainly declined rather than improved over the past yearGreat prices and quick service Perfect for lunch on a time crunch"

    "review":"This is actually an outpost of Srees restaurant in Squirrel HillDespite the somewhat lowrent appearance of the trailer the food is actually really good I would generally recommend the veg lunch but only because those dishes are delicious If you need meat they also have pretty good chicken even though its all white meat My only complaint is their chutney but thats because I happen to really like mango chutney And yes the bread truly sucks fortunately theres more than enoughfood as it isSree did have a a white guy serving up food at some point but so what I dont see why you need to be an ethnic to serve ethnic food In any case Im pretty sure he wasnt the cook The last time I was there it was a nice Indian lady short enough to fit into the trailerAll in all Ive found this to be really nice place to get decent South Indian food not that far off from what you might find on the subcontinent and not the fancy stuff you end up with in a restaurant in this areaCheck it outnot that great smoky rotis really dont go well with the sabzi they served also the mango lassi was almost as thin as a shake not my first choice for lunchThis place provided sustenance for the four of my five years in college at Carnegie Mellon A meal used to be four bucks for the longest time while all the other food trucks next to it raised it up to 450 at one point making this place a really good choice They claim they use no MSGs but judging by their shadiness of the truck itself and the white men who worked there who knows what actually goes into the food Whatever I didnt care at all back then I was grateful that I could walk out from my dorm and two minutes later have hot Indian food in my hands They give you enough rice Tamarind chicken and one side dish that will fill you up You can also opt for vegetarian and just pick the sides they have as the entree too One real downer is that their naan is pretty crappy: it tastes pretty much like frozenpak gyro pocket breadsAnother CMU food truck  Good prices and OK food  Indian food from a truck is not particularly appealing to me Id prefer to walk a little further and have Indian food on Craig Street  If Im in a real hurry I prefer other trucks"

    "review":"AWESOME spot for Sunday Brunch  Have been twice and love it  There is something for everyone and with a vegetarian and vegan in our Pittsburgh crowd Zenith is great for making EVERYONE happy  The food is good not lifechanging but still solid and there is a buffet  Which has pasta salad  And cake  What  I would be happy eating nothing BUT pasta salad and cake  But then you order a main entree that is generally a hot dish too  And drumroll its 10  Last time I was there I had lemon blueberry french toast it was hot and gooey and lemoney and had fresh blueberries delivered exactly as expectedThe service is friendly and the atmosphere is super cool you never run out of things to look at since its an antique shop as wellCool place for anyone but must try for vegetariansOne of the best places where one can enjoy brunch in PittsburghTo be honest Im not a big fan of brunch mostly because Im a guy and would like spend more time doing real fun stuff But Zenith has never brought me this kind of feeling since going to Zenith is something FUNNo need to say to much about their food Just wonderfulThe real interesting things are their decorations as well as all kinds of antiques that fill up the entire place A mustgo in PittsburghI give the food 5 stars but the cleanliness and decor a 3 The place is an antique shop but I use the word shop loosely It looks like a very disorganized basement with junk I have never seen anyone buy anything in here and frankly the place is so dirty that Im not sure that youd want to I dont think that anything has ever been cleaned in there Where you eat the food seems better but I noticed a fly or two around some of the food It is laid out in a home buffet style I did notice one gross thing Each table has its own placemats I figured that between people they would change themNope The hostess scratched the crumbs and such off the place mat and then seated other people there Again the place has great food but after waiting there for almost 30 minutes with the junk I couldnt wait to leaveAwesome unique place my boyfriend took me to and figured I would like it I definitely loved the decor from all the antiques and vintage oddities I absolutely loved the atmosphere it was great Im really glad he took me herehowever the food we ended  up getting was pretty good but since we arrived later on in the early afternoon they were sold out of most the menu which was awful but the buffet we has was ok but I definitely would love to go back again and try more options on the menu that we wanted to tryReally unique place to eat Im not vegetarian but loved it Cool atmosphere Great value for the priceI adore Zenith Ive since explained this place to nonPittsburghers as the hipster Cracker Barrel though that description does not do Zenith enough justice I chose the pumpkin pancake as my main entre at my last visit but I have to admit the star of the show is the buffet table There wasnt a single item I tried from the buffet that was anything less than stellar from creamy peanut butter Asian noodles to the fresh crisp salad because then I can pretend that Im eating healthy right to the myriad cakes they have lying in tantalizing wait for you at the buffet finish line ahhhh Lovely My only regret is that I was too full to try more of those delectable bundt cakes After our feast we had a blast browsing through all of the antiques at the front of the store Will be back soon"

    "review":"Get me some Peanutzz We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was 3 This didnt seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are 15 and 20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money Peanutz is a small venue The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom If you werent at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music I thought the music was awesome though  a mix of old school and underground hip hop Beers were so cheap  I think we paid 5 for three draft beers Woot However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke I wont be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanutsTo start the bathrooms are DISGUSTING with that being said I would never EAT anything here again  This is a neighborhood bar for me  Ive been in here a handful of times the crowd is never rowdy or out of control  The bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere I normally only drink Coor Light drafts which are 275 thats a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars  I have had the wings in the past before I saw what a disaster the bathrooms were  They fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh The patrons are a older work crowd not too may youngsters here  I have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekendOur bartender didnt know what a pint was or how to pour a beerIve been here a few times Cant beat five dollar Coors Light pitchers The crowd tends to be black I tend to be white And obviously from out of town People are friendly Its just a neighborhood bar People talk to each other and have a good time The food is well priced and good The music is going to blow your ears up if you care about that dont comePeanutz is a perfectly good neighborhood bar on East Ohio Street  Their beer selection is adequate basically all the American macro lagers plus a few of the more widelyknown craft beers like Sierra Nevada and their bar is stocked with the full gamut of booze except ouzo  Trish the bartender is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongueI havent tried very many of the menu items except for the chicken wings which are a house specialty  Everyone recommends the FourDip sauce which is pretty good  The Cajun rub is good tooDecorwise Peanutz is focused largely on Pittsburgh sports  there are two large display cases with all sorts of sports memorabilia  Theres a handsome wooden bar in the front room and a dining room off to the sideI went here on a Saturday night with a few friends  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of 3  boo  Im really adverse to covers unless theres something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before I was taking a chance  For those that know me Im not the gambling kind  But I thought ok its just 3 so its not like Id be going broke  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing  It wasnt overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks  Am I glad I checked this place out  sure but have I been to better dance clubsbars  yes  If youre in the area and looking for something to do then check it out but I wouldnt make a special trip to go here"

    "review":"Penn Station East Coast Subs or PSECS as they shall be known going forward was lousy and definitely not worth the wait in the long linesThis location just opened up 23 weeks ago and I think the overall experience was no goodI had the chicken parm sandwich 10 and french fries  The french fries were the best part but they werent really that good eitherThe sandwich had next to no meat on it and the onions overpowered everything on the sandwich  There was a ton of bread which was good enough but the chicken got completely lost  Once you lose the protein in the dish theres not much you can do to recoverTheres a huge market downtown lunch market and I cant believe they pass up the opportunity by serving substandard fareIll give them another try eventually but I guess I dont really see the pointReally good food at really good prices  there was so much meat in my sandwich it was falling out the sides  I eat here quite often as I work downtown and have always had a good experienceGot their grilled veggie 6 sandwich The taste was great Compared to subway this sub had a lot more flavor and was hot grilled and deliciousAnother place to go for a nice veggie sandwich It is hard to find veggie options in most places  and even if you do they are not delicious This is an exceptionA must try if you are in the areaFirstly I would love if they wore gloves Second the last time I was there the man preparing the food was doing multiple things Unfortunately I didnt catch him before making my sandwich cause apparently grabbing the broom phone and etc wasnt means to stop and wash your dirty hands It kills me how much people just dont care because they are not the ones eating the food so therefore they take less precaution and people like that should be fired and not allowed to work in a food place establishmentI got a 6 inch Italian and I was pleasantly surprised The staff was very helpful and friendly while the sandwich was grilled perfectly and the cheese and meat good quality and tasted excellent I will say that this particular sandwich was just a little bit salty and a bit messyAll in all very good location if you need a quick cheap tasty lunchPenn station has delicious subs including the Italian and the Pizza  My biggest issue with this location is that the employees dont do well with any kind of special requests  For example I ordered an Italian sub with no mayo over the phone which was confirmed by the receipt only to receive an Italian sub slathered in mayo  Its like the guy prepping it saw  mayonnaise on the order and assumed that meant emphasize the mayo I have several coworkers who have had similar experiences with sauces and condiments here"

    "review":"Not sure why everyone rated this place poorly Its actually a really great for what it is I mean its a pizza place in a college area so its not gourmet or anythingBUT unlike all the other shops this place has burgers wraps and several other great alternatives to just pizza Ive had their salads hoagies and pizza and all have been fantastic Plus they have a bar and sell 6 packs Always a plusI wish I could give 0 stars Rude service took two hours to deliver inedible freezing cold food and when I called to get my order right the people on the phone were douche bags and refused to refund me after sending the delivery guy three times He forgot my drinks too That was the first and LAST time I will ever order from here PukeId give this place two stars tops on taste alone both the pizza and hoagies are kind of bland and taste more like bread than anything else but the false advertising was enough to turn the doughy taste in my mouth into a sour one  Ignoring some unbelievably nonmainstream usage of the word large to describe a fairly small pizza charging extra money for Fast  Free Delivery is the kind of sketchy move that will ensure I never become a repeat customerAfter reading the reviews on Papa Da Vinici and only living about 5 minutes away we decided to try it out With all the rain we were getting we didnt really feel like cooking so we ordered a large pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni and 6 wings Estimated delivery time was about an hour which we were ok with seeing as how a lot of people were probably ordering due to the storm What we did not expect however was for our pizza and wings to be ice cold when they arrived a half an hour late We did not expect the wings to have sauce simply poured over them in the container instead of tossed as most places do The pizza crust was so thin that it could barely hold the toppings The sauce was pretty much non existent and the extra cheese looked pretty lacking It scares me to see what a normal cheese pizza would look like There was a good amount of pepperoni however The wings were a soggy mess with very little flavor and the hot sauce was more of a sweet gelatin gloop than it was hot with the heat coming from the extreme amount of pepper flake in it Overall I was extremely dissatisfied with the service food and overall quality of our meal The highlight of our meal was the large tin of popcorn that arrived via UPS while eating dinneri only ordered once from here on a sunday night at about 830i live literally about a 2 min walk from the restaurant but was drunk watching the steelers game and wanted something other then pizza I ordered online and after about an hour and 15 min i finally decided to call and say heywheres my food at keep in mind im a very low maintenance food eater when it  comes to eating out  but75 min is pretty ridiculous seeing as i could walk there in about 5 never the lessthe guy said it was a busy night and my driver was out with my food and he had about 6 orders total why he wouldnt deliver to the address closest first is beyond me but o well he wasnt rude and seemed like a college kid who sorta gave a crap my food arived about 80 minutes after i ordered and the delivery guy was pretty nice and even apoligized for the wait the food was hot but the fries and garlic bread were literally drenched and soggyall in all this is a place that if you are drunk late at night its good decent prices and decent food if you are looking for some actual italian food you are better off going to a freakin olive garden and thats not saying muchas wellwith my meal i opted out of the side salad but got one anywayswhich isnt an issuebut that says something about them paying attention to order detailsI came in for business and the owner was so polite and professional on taking my delivery order and it was there in less time then quoted I decided for a whole week to order from only Papa DaVinci I came in to order and meet the staff Kelly was just as pleasant and efficient Great place to go"

    "review":"While walking back to work from Spice Island one day I made a mental note to try more pizza places in Oakland First on the list  Pizza RomanoI walked in around 11:10 and was one of their first customers I saw them rolling out the dough for my XL pie which is definitely a good sign The pizza came out fresh and piping hot and continued to be hot even after I carried it all the way back to work I mention this because I have an undying love for cold pizza but Pizza Romano is a dish best served fresh out of the ovenHere is the breakdown:Crust  texture was kind of blah and uninspired but the dough was extremely wholesome  like eating a roll or something  and definitely tasted pretty fresh Not crisp or chewy enough for me thoughCheese  best part of the pizza for sure Lots of cheese very chewy and stretchy like one of those lame commercials where a family is sitting around the table on a Friday night instead of the reality that they are sitting in a living room watching awful TV while the parents get wasted on wine coolers and Canadian blended whiskey However the cheese quality slowly declined as the temperature of the slice went down and I would describe this pizza as one that would be much less tasty when cold or leftoverSauce  eh It was red some tomato flavor some spices but nothing that knocks my socks offPrice  ten bucks for a freshoutoftheoven 18 inch cant complain about that Overall this pizza was average It would probably be best if eaten in the restaurant but there isnt a whole lot to look at in the restaurant no TVs no bars no other patrons so make sure if you order it that your final destination is close I would recommend Milanos over Romano if youre looking for a delicious and budgetconscious slice in OaklandJust ordered the Mediterranean Hoagie  Eggplant Parm Hoagie last night and had it delivered at 1AM Not only were they delicious and huge saved half for lunch the next day but they were one of the only places open in Pittsburgh who actually delivers past midnight And they have a huge vegetarian selection Highly recommended35 stars Competent pizza shop food at pretty reasonable pricesThe pizza itself is based on a doughy bready soft crust complimented by tangy herby pizza sauce The cheese is salty and the good kind of rubbery It reminds me of Little Caesars almost but with decidedly better ingredients Its a big improvement from nearby Antoons or Sorrentos Any fare based off these ingredients works well In particular their cheesy breadsticks are absolutely delicious and are my goto option when in the mood for carb laden foodThe other stuff on the menu such as hoagies wings and sides is done pretty decently Their buffalo sauce in particular isnt strictly a buffalo sauce but its tangy spicy and bold As such their buffalo chicken hoagie is one of my favorites in Oakland Additionally both their standard variety fries and buffalo fries are crispy wellseasoned and flavorful Killer student specials cut prices significantly so Romano isnt too tough on the walletThis isnt destination eating but if youre nearby its worth a tryI dont know why I keep running into bad luck with pizza shops in Pittsburgh but its really disheartening  Pizza Romano usually has a decent veggie sub that I order when my husband is craving wings and pizza  Apparently though this time that we ordered they failed to tell us that their menu had changed  Instead of a medley of vegetables they gave me goopy eggplant soggy tomato cheese and some type of liquid that had made bread into soup  I wouldnt even attempt to eat it  I called and THEN they notified me of the change  No big deal but their new menu stated that there should be eggplant tomato zuchinni and mushrooms on it  I saw no mushrooms or zuchinni Also their garlic bread was weak and disgusting and tiny  Not worth it  I am really disappointed with our experience Needless to say we wont be ordering from there again  I just hope we can find a restaurant that can provide quality when were craving some deliveryWe have been here several times and the pizza is awesome We ordered the buffalo chicken the Tuscan chicken and have sampled the wings as well Dont let the negative reviews fools you  his place has great pizza and wingsThe quality of pizza here is on par with any of the other joints in the Oakland area such as Sorrentos or Antoons The prices are slightly higher but it seems the pies here are made to order rather than being premade"

    "review":"Eh I wasnt crazy about this place My sesame shrimp was just ok and nothing exciting The same could be said about the almond puff dessert The steamed dumplings were pretty good though The service was not great at all Weirdly enough its inside the Galleria right above Dragonfire in an open loftTheir food is delicious  They also have fresh sushi The only thing Ive had that I have not cared for is their hibatchi I had the hibatchi chicken and my friend had hibatchi shrimp They were both dry We were disappointed because normally the food is outstanding Lesson learned Stick to the Chefs specialties and the sushiMy son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pis China Gate  The food was very good  I think its changed hands and heres why  We were seated and given menus  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later ALL of our food was brought out  I was shocked  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast  My son took one bite I didnt even bother and we called the waiter back over  I told her I expected fresh food not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay  I refused  I will never go back  There is such a thing as food too fast  If I wanted fast food Id have gone to Mickey DsI was actually surprised whenever I checked into China Gate and it had a lower than average rating I was curious as to how my meal was going to be because Ive had some bad Chinese beforeMy friend Brandi  I did painting with a twist at the Galleria during the malls art week She had been to China Gate before and explained to me how cute it was so we both agreed to eat here The restaurant is upstairs in a loftlike area of the Galleria and you can see some of the mall from hereMy friend and I werent extremely hungry and we noticed that the plates were pretty large so we decided to split a plate of general tsos We also ordered white rice as a side and egg rolls for appetizers No complaints on the food It wasnt bad at all The only spotty thing was i had track down the server for a water refill when my water was empty for awhile and there were only a few other people in the restaurant Other than that which honestly isnt a big deal at all it was satisfyingOh there is also a full bar thumbs up emojiIt had been several years since I visited this restaurant  I used to dine here almost every Sunday for a marvelous buffet that regrettably is no longer offeredThis was our second choice  We had tried to get into the newlyopened BRGR downstairs but were told that there was a ninety to one hundred twenty minute wait to get into the loud and raucous atmosphere in which diners are placed in very close proximity to others: no thanks  No meal is worth waiting that long for and it is probably just as well that there would not be any tables available until well into the evening because it is not a pleasant place to eat  We enjoyed the quiet of China GateWhat sets this restaurant apart from others is its beautiful space in the regions most exclusive and lovely mall  Both sides of the restaurant offer a view of the lower level of the mall enabling the diner to engage in interesting peoplewatching throughout the mealOur server was a woman who used to serve as buffet busser  Her command of English is not great but good enough  She is pleasant and provided good and attentive service with regular plateclearing and water refillsThe crispy noodles with which the meal begins are delicious a great first course  I ordered pork egg roll and pork lo mein  The egg roll was not very good because it was not hot  The lo mein was priced relatively high at 1000 but it was worth it as it was ample and delicious  It was also very salty as evidenced by the amount of water I felt compelled to consume after dinnerMy wife ordered mixed vegetables with tofu and brown rice  It was also a good portion and prepared wellThose who regularly dine at area Chinese restaurants will find the prices of many dishes to be highWe eat out a lot and love Chinese but this place has gone over the years from excellent to OK to bad Tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time The waitress arrived promptly took our drink orders and then disappeared for about 30 minutes finally showing up with my wine but no water for which we had to ask three times After another quarter of an hour she shows up again takes our order reappearing in another quarter of an hour with one of the entres but no appetizers She takes back the entre and five minutes later brings the egg roll and soup but still no water Then she brings the entres one if which was the one I had sent back it had not even been reheated  and another which was not the one my husband had ordered Finally we get the correct one but by now it was also a bit on the cool side Then we had to had to ask for rice which did arriv fairly promptly It took nearly a half hour to get the bill which was wrong we were undercharged by one glass of wine So we paid the bill including for the missing wine and left two and a half hours after we arrived The restaurant is understaffed poorly managed and the staff is badly trained Too bad Several years ago it was wonderful"

    "review":"A typical sports bar in Shadyside Ive only been here once a couple years ago but from what I remember the beer selection was pretty good and the quality of the food is about par To be honest I prefer watching the game elsewhere hence why I havent been back However Id recommend a stopin sometime to see if the place and vibe tickle your fancyOne of my favorite bars in Shadyside The bartenders are awesome with a great sense of humor and they even help me with recommendations for new drinks to try out when Im bored of my same old go to  Once you get to know the staff they actually acknowledge the fact that they know you which makes you feel like going out was worth it Last night busy Saturday night my bartender got so busy he had to jump to the outdoor bar to help out and forgot to bring me my wings but he quickly apologized gave them to me for free and even overly compensated with a free drink as well Great service and they really do care about their customers Weeknights are a little slow what else do you expect but weekends are packed starting around midnight it can be fun but it can also get annoying with the constant bumping and pushing to navigate through the crowds But if you have a table either inside or outside with friends you forget how busy it isIf youre in the area I highly recommend you to stop in for a few drinks and try some snacks You wont be disappointedBombbbbbbbbb A wings  Cheap and tasty how we like it Nice bartenders and speedy service Decent beer specials Only thing its missing is a pinball machine  Definitely will make this a regular spotThose stars are for the wings If your not ordering wings dont come I havent tried everything on the menu buttttttt the nachos are skimpy and salty and those Mac and cheese bites are nothing but Kraft boxed Mac and cheese no thank you Oh and extra ranch is 75 cent and comes in a little cup smh But wings are delicious and great priceBeer and wing specials almost daily and THE BEST wings Ive ever put in my mouthget the the kitchen sink wings and spicy ranch wings If you try and hate either of them then you probably dont deserve to live a happy fulfilled life Legitimately salivate every time I think about these wings Now Ive developed a craving Thanks yelp for making me write this review and causing intense hunger painsOh and its also the goto bar for CMU students so if youre into thatGood For Dancing: NoAlthough not the typical place to go dancing as the place is pretty small the music here is so good that it makes my friends and I dance each time we come here A place that allows some dancing is an automatic 5star bar In addition though food was pretty good and service was great and I promise Im not saying that just because our server was very attractive I dont come to Shadyside often but when I do this is my goto place"

    "review":"I took my girlfriend there for our anniversary on a Friday night We got all dressed up and made reservations for 8pm but when I arrived we clearly didnt need reservations It was kind of empty and I was kinda disappointed when the hostess took us all the way to the back of the restaurant not seating us in the main dining room because the old school architecture was a marvel to look at It use to be an old train station I believe But since it was late at night the whole river and city were light up so our seat was very romantic Our waiter his name was Greg I believe was truly amazing and knowledgeable They gave us special menues that had happy anniversary printed on them and told us we could keep the menus which just added to the fun of the experience We started out with a few cocktails memory escapes me what we tried but they were all very good and ordered fresh oysters on the half shell bruschetta montrachet and almond encrusted brie Oh my goodness everything was quite amazing and tasty My girl friend was already full by the time the main course came which didnt stop me from taking a few bites of her dish of shrimp fresca and my dish of tilapia provencale Both were very filling and well served Greg was an exceptional waiter He had our drinks filled before we even needed to ask and checked on us often to make sure everything was cooked perfectly He even told us a funny anniversary story about his parents that made us laugh and feel welcomed We got a rich chocolate dessert to split after as well All the while a piano player in the background played top 40 songs on his keys as it became fun trying guess and sing along to the songs he was playing Our experience was fantastic even though the bill was kind of expensive but hell it was totally worth it in my opinion It honestly felt like we were kings and queens by the amount of good food we ate and the treatment our server gave us I would definitely go back there for a special occasion and recommend this place to othersAmazing place Great place great food Greg was very gracious and went out of his way to assist us and our friendWe took our son there for his 21st birthday and had a small group of seven Definitely a nice place for special occasions Upscale with service to match and amazing atmosphere and view of the river and Pittsburgh skyline Food was excellent across the board except for one side that was extremely salty  server never hesitated and was prompt to address the issue to our satisfactionAnother enjoyable dining experience The staff was friendly knowledgeable and accommodating as we remembered from visits there in years pastIm giving a 4 because of the service: it should be excellent at a fancy restaurant versus my below average experience   The food was very good thoughI sat for about 10 minutes without anyone coming to my table  Before coming to greet me and pour me some water I could see my waitress chatting with another employee for about 10 minutes  Then she went over to a table where the diners had already left checked the amount of tip she got and finally stopped by my table I guess after that she did an average job but she had already left me with a very bad impressionThe food was good  I got cedar plank salmon  The fish was cooked well and was soft and juicy although it could have been salted less I would go to Mitchells Fish Market if youre looking for excellent fish  It was served with roasted vegetables  They had a good amount of seasoning and tasted greatOverall I guess I had a good experience: beautiful setting lovely view of downtown and good food  The service should have been better but maybe I was just unlucky with my waitressAs far as ambiance this place is awesome Its located inside of an old train station and the details are beautiful It actually would make for a cool event venue The service was great throughout the meal but the food really wasnt anything great The mussels and crab cakes are what I would recommend The prices are Ok but the portions are small I would return but I am confused as to why this place was dead at on a Friday night"

    "review":"Best grilled lamb sanwich on the face of the earth awesome grape leaves dont forget the hummusIve had Shawerma that melts in your mouth  Not here The sandwich is more like a wrap than a traditional Shawerma  I should have realized that when they asked if I wanted Provolone on it Its not that bad its just not what one thinks of when ordering a Shawerma  Their version has the meat herbs onions tomato and lettuce tightly wrapped in something a little thicker than a tortilla but a lot thinner than pita bread  Its also kind of on the expensive side  8 without a side  Most people were ordering salads  Perhaps thats what I should have doneNot too impressed  very crowded Loud  poor seating  Gyro had little to no flavor Expensive  Poor parking Sorry Guys I wont be backGreat Lebanese food at a great price Kafta and hummus are awesome They have raw kibbee on SaturdaysAnother place I finally went to then immediately kicked myself for never having eaten hereWife got the Grilled Lamb Pita I got the Beef Schwarma Pita  I got feta cheese but on the side  My wife does not like hummus but her order came with it so I said put it on the sideLong story short every aspect of the entire meal was great  The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned  Same with the Schwarma  And the hummus the wife finished it off  It was smooth and tasty deliciousI am really used to hummus that is just a bit grainy and  has a pronounced tahini and lemon flavor  usually just on this side of bitter  I mean I like hummus but I always assumed it was supposed to taste a little bitterThe hummus here was a revelation  It was smooth and creamy  And the tastes were so mild you could taste all of the individual ingredients but it all blended into a smooth delicious flavor unlike anything I have ever had before with hummus  It was GREATThe side of feta cheese was also something new and delicious  And again I was so used to feta cheese being hard a little bitter sharp tasting  In this case the feta was shredded  It was smooth and tasty and melted in my mouthThe lamb and the beef schwarma pitas were every bit as good  This place usurps every other middle eastern pita or wrap I have ever had anywhere ever at any time ever in my life  EverI am off tomorrow as well and am going to do the vegetarian thing  In fact up until now my line had always been if all food was as good as Indian food I would be able to be a vegetarian  Now the vegetarian thing includes this place  I am going to update the review if I remember  I was going to do Taj Mahal lunch buffet but am coming back to Kassabs and I am getting the sleek the eggplant stuff that parsley grain salad etc sorry I dont remember the names of the items but I know the ingredientsThursday  Vegetarian day at Kassabs  I cant wait  YUMThis place has amazing gyros i never knew a gyro could have such flavor coming from a place not named for its gyros The interior is nice and cozy with tall ceilings and greek mural drawings on the wall I really enjoy the ambiance We always go for lunch when its not too busy I get their lamb gyro with cheese The feta cheese they put on top makes taste even better The taste of fresh tomatoes and lettuce plus their sauce is outta this world Its probably the best gyro on the south sideIve never tried too much of their other food except their meat pie which is store bought not freshly prepared so those i would have to say were pretty bad they were very dry Just bread and ground beef with no real flavor we pushed it to the side while waiting for our gyro I read that the grape leaves werent too appetizing so it leaves me to wonder what else this place has to offerUpdate I tried the grape leaves and they were ok A little on the tender side and by tender I mean too soft Ive had better before so I guess thats what I am comparing them too"

    "review":"Overall very good restaurant It seemed they were a little under staffed the day I was there as we waited about 15 minutes before a server even came over to us Wait time from ordering your food to when it finally comes was a little longer than expected as well but we were compensated with an order of free bisquits Definitely going back and hoping that they have more people working next timeWent to Bakn the other day and it was fairaverage It was crowded because it was lunch time and had to wait a few minutes 510 to get seated Communal tableAs we were looking at our menus there were three people standing near the soda machineservice window and none of them took any initiative to provide the table water  Didnt really seem very team oriented  Gotta help each other in a busy restaurantLike I said the food was fine I had a chicken sandwich with bacon and it was ok I would also expect since this had bacon on it that given the name of the restaurant that it would be great  The bacon was average as well I doubt that Id return but usually try and give places 2 triedOverpriced and underwhelming I have been looking forward to trying this place out especially with all of the good reviews but I am sad to say it did not live up to the hype I have no problem paying for a good meal but this was definitely not worth it To start the bloody mary was one of the worst Ive ever had It was watery tomato juice with bland horseradish and a slimey piece of bacon Took a few sips and set it aside The caprese flatbread was doused in some kind of pesto sauce and the crust was soggy and doughey instead of thin and crisp Didnt finish this either Also tried the bacon flight    5 pieces of bacon each prepared a different way 5 pieces of thin limp bacon that I left on the plate The only thing I did finish was the soda water not Perrier or San Pallegrino mind you but soda water from the bar gun for which they charged me 2 and called sparkling water on the bill which totalled 31 Next time I head to Carnegie it will not be to BaknThree times and I am a fanLOVE the foodLOVE the BloodiesName is Bakn and they do not even cut and make their own bacon  Way over priced for Mcdonalds fries and an over cooked burger with a tiny piece of bacon I can buy at AldisGreat food a little tight on seating though Really unique drink choices too Not really great for pickyeating kids though"

    "review":"Not as good as Wholeys but awesome patio and the best service Go here for the atmosphere the staff is the bestWe visited Rolands on Sunday for an early dinner and drinks The hostess at the front felt her conversation about another customer was more important than greeting and seating us It took about 5 minutes for her to even acknowledge out presence After we were finally seated it then took another 10 minutes for a server to take our drink order in fact we were just about to leave when he made his way over I didnt think it could get any worsebut it did He brought us waters first then our beers little did we know these were the only drinks we would get The restaurants doors were open and the day was hot and humid perfect for enjoying a lobster roll and cold beer Our waiter brought our food we ordered a second round and he was never seen again I witnessed more apologies to customers that day than I ever have It wasnt even crowded Having my own experience in the food service industry I realize how hard this job can be but this was unacceptable The type of service you receive will make or break a restaurant and I highly doubt we will be back This was our second terrible visit and I am not willing to give a third strike chanceStopped in for a drink Place was pretty empty for being lunch time dont judge me for drinking at noon I was on vacation Server had a sense of humor and was able to recommend a drink for my wife that she enjoyed Outside seating was full but those tables were really smallThis was my second time eating at Rolands  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didnt even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again It wasnt that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just cant see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight againOverall the experience here was pretty good  I had the lobster roll previously and wanted to go back for it a second time on a Friday during lent  I expected it to be quite crowded during dinner time however arriving at 6:30 there was no wait for 3  The lobster roll was pretty good although I do remember it being better I wished that there was something extra on the sandwich such as melted butter And they raised the price a dollar  Rolands has a huge draft beer selection Each of us tried a different beer and they were reasonably priced around 450 each  I would definitely go back but not any time soonMy boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon We tried mussels clam chowder jumbo shrimp cocktail and a burger  The mussels were an appetizer portion and were enough for three people They were perfectly cooked and very sweet  The shrimp are sold a la carte I ordered 6 of them and was a bit let down that 2 of them were a bit dry The cocktail sauce served with the shrimp had wonderfully spicy horseradish and was perfect  The New England clam chowder was not overly thick and had lots of clams in it Lastly the burger topped with gorgonzola cheese came with fries and cole slaw and was excellent  The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because our waiter got overwhelmed by a few large parties and disappeared on us  We had to flag down the hostess to get our waiter to bring us our check Other than some dry shrimp and the service issue we had an enjoyable dinner"

    "review":"Went twice for dinner  Two dishes blew me awayThe Fish Basil and the Pad Thai  Ive been to 2030 Thai restaurants and the the Pad Thai was perhaps the best Ive tasted  Other dishes were ok but didnt stand out  These included: Beef Noodle Soup Massaman Curry Red Curry Pa Ram Chicken and the Somosa and Steamed Dumpling appetizersThe place was full by 7:30 Saturday night so you should probably make a reservationNickys offers delicious food and a great atmosphere The outdoor patio in the back is a very romantic spot with lots of plants and youll definitely feel like youre on vacation anywhere except the Burgh Very Cool vibe Id highly recommend it for a date night or birthday celebrationSuch a beautiful outdoor dining area You wouldnt believe youre in the city while there Charming flowers and fountains beware the one may squirt water on you  The food is wonderful I only wish they had a vegetarian soup like other thai places  Simply wonderful dining experienceIf you are looking for an upscale authentic Thai restaurant than look no further You will be in for a sure treat This place is amazing My husband and I went to Nickys for the first time last weekend and absolutely loved it You will definitely not leave disappointedEhh I wasnt impressed Lots of people told me about this place before I went and tried it Once we finally got there the staff werent the friendliest and the food was overpriced and not overly tasty5  Stars for the food our waiter was one star at best But the food was so good who cares if a few things were late  Great selection and so flavorful The Thai experts in our group rated it very highly as well and they go to Bangkok so Ill believe them"

    "review":"Fernandos Cafe is an excellent place to stop in and have lunch or dinner if your looking for good pizza or hoagies  It really doesnt look like much but in the inner city life they tend to be the best places to stop  The pizza if a good fair price and tastes excellent  Their sandwiches are plenty good and they are not cheap with their toppings The daily deals are well worth stopping back for The staff if really laid back and a good group of people  If youre in town for a convention they are in full support of most of what cones to townService took about an hour and half when the guy on phone said it would take 45 mins Order from this place if you can enjoy waiting for your food that longThe only time I ever see this place is during Anthrocon so my experience may be a lot different from other Yelpers What I noticed is even though the restaurant is busy during the convention they have extra staff behind the counter to keep the line moving That said their subs are average at best I actually do like the place more for breakfast than for lunch or dinner because at breakfast time I can get a whopping big pile of ham sausage bacon and egg on a bun and the coffee is free The only thing that seemed sketchy to me is on the third day of the convention I noticed that they taped over the part of the menu where it says chips and drink come with a combo mealFresh delicious generous portions for reasonable pricesTheir food is said to be homemadeOur creamy fresh potato salad was in a generous container and cost just 199The cheesecake slices especially the oreo flavored one were delicious treatsThe pizza was pretty good alsoFernandos Cafe is our new favorite take out place and were glad they deliver to our areaI am a huge fan of the pizza here Large portions at a cheap price I usually order a small pizza for lunch and the cheese is so gooey and delicious I didnt rate them a 5 because the service here can be offGreat lunch for a low price I ordered the turkey bacon swiss wrap and it was really good I definitely recommend"

    "review":"This place is owned and operated by the same guys that do Sonoma Grill which is just down the street  I went there opening weekend and was impressed  Its a little on the small side but it had an electric atmosphere  The music was lively and the space was open and vibrant and really captured the feel of Cuba or South Beach  Being the new night spot also atrracted the best looking people save for me and my friends which made for a better environment  We had some tapas which were quite tasty but I havent eaten any of their entrees  If the apps were an indication I think the entrees will just fineThank you to our waiter and this amazing food  Our waiter was super nice the tacos here are so good and the ceviche was so fresh There literally was nothing I could say about this place that could be wrong expect maybe parking is hard to find  Id give it a full 5 stars but I didnt try the other entrees so I can not speak for everything  But if the entrees are as good as the other items I did try then this place will be give a five next timeI am from the burgh but recently move out of town I have been to this place numerous times but recently it has gone downhill IMO  I took my Hispanic friend there two times and he actually told me to never take him there again We went on a Saturday night in Sept and there was nothing going on The manager was bartending and was kind enough to introduce herself  However they were blasting obnoxious hard core vulgar RAP music the entire time They were out of about 6 menu items and the 10 cocktail was very weak If Im going to pay top prices for food and drink which I have no problem doing I kind of expect a nicer atmosphere an atmosphere they they supposedly try to project to me it was no surprise that there were many empty seats and just about as many patrons as there were employees that night We will not be returning I was actually embarrassed to have taken him there    Overrated and over priced for what you get   Yes Latin themed   NotExcellent and tasty small food  Extremely expensive so be sure it is a special occasion or an important date  Check in on Yelp to get a free sangriaThe dishes are tapasstyle and generally shared among your companions  Order approximately 23 per person  Some of the tacos were astounding and high quality  Not much that I didnt like about it service was above averageClientele is on the young side and kind of trendy so it wouldnt hurt to dress up  Great place to go after the opera or showCame for dinner late on Monday night  They serve food late and it was Salsa night so decent crowd and a good atmosphere for a rainy Monday  Also had Monday night football on so a nice touch there at the bar  Had several margaritas which were good  Had the chicken soup which was appropriately spicey and a good size  Then had pomegranate tuna ceviche  It was average and not the freshest fish   Had the salmon for entree which was ok but strange  It was sitting in a bowl of Cuban au jus and the quality of the fish was average  Overall  good spot for a decent late night dinner but otherwise average food and fairly high pricesIll start with the positives  good atmosphere tasty food good cocktails Why I gave it 3 stars  service wasnt very good I felt like I had to flag our waitress down anytime I wanted somethingThen the bill came Not only did the waitress tell me she added an item that I didnt order because she didnt know where else to put it we had a large party but I saw that the draft beer I was drinking was 9 each Im in Pittsburgh not Manhattan so draft beer should not cost that much and that price was not listed on the menu I talked to a manager who agreed to take off the item I didnt order but wasnt as understanding about the cost of the draft beer or the fact that it wasnt on the menu She was friendly but felt she could have done more given the size of our party and the amount of money we just spent there Probably wont return"

    "review":"Pros: Super fast very affordable Im from out of town so maybe its not as affordable by Pittsburgh standards Goodsized portions Grape leaves were excellent I had the meatless version Rice pudding was quite good tooCons: Its pretty lowfrills Some of the food is a bit greasyWent here for lunch to try something different The first thing I noticed is that I felt like a took a time machine back to the 80s when I entered Some simple renovations would make this place look a million times better It just didnt feel clean to me for some reason and it was rather dark  The staff was overall fairly friendly but Ive definitely experienced better customer service I got a chicken gyro which was average The pita was good and all the ingredients were good as well The chicken was average My problem was with the amount of sauce and onions they put on it It was overloaded with the sauce so much so that it virtually drowned the pita I also feel like there was about a half an onion on the gyro Overall it was ok but I probably wouldnt go backIm being generous since I didnt actually eat here My dad and I walked in around 7 pm on a Friday night The place was pretty busy The dining room was about half full The other half of the tables were covered in dirty dishes A large party of people were gathered in the middle standing around and shouting loudly People just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason We told the lady at the counter we hadnt been here before and asked her what to do She said order your food She said it pretty rudely and we still werent exactly sure what to do We decided we didnt want to eat at a place with lousy service filthy tables and unruly patrons and walked outA little divey but its a good place for a quick gyro downtown Salonikas has a pretty decent menu of Greek dishes along with a different daily special for every day of the week And they also have a bar in the back When I lived downtown this was my and my husbands goto for a quick and affordable meal that was not fast food Salonikas might be cheaper than McDonalds if you really take into consideration all that youre getting My husband always ordered a gyro dinner and I sometimes got the falafel veggie plate or one of the daily specials Nothing fancy But thats my thing good doesnt have to be fancy For Salonikas to get a decent crowd for dinner despite several other GreekMediterranean restaurants on the same street they have to be doing something rightWhile staying at the Renaissance in downtown Pittsburgh we swung in here for a late night bite to eat On out visit we had the Gyro combo and a greek salad Both were extremely affordable and delicious The staff at Salonika was great as well Very friendly and approachable If ever in downtown Pittsburgh for a show and looking for a great and cheap bite to eat look no further than Salonika Gyros And they are open lateThis is a local dive bar and be prepared to find some interesting characters That being said I ordered a gyro with the lemon fries My sandwich was excellent The pita was fresh the meat was juicy and flavorful the sauce and toppings were a perfect balance The lemon fries were good but I would prefer them to have been more crispy and less grease I ordered shock top which was on tap I was so pleased because it is a seasonal beer The place is clean but I would never take my kids The bartender will talk your  ear off but was a nice person with a little crazy added on I felt like being in a just got out of jail commercial with everyone coming in to buy a 40 from the beer cooler If I am ever back in town and plan on going to a game I will grab a sandwich from here for sure"

    "review":"Short update here  my wife and I tried the crabshack and buffalo burgers this afternoon and they were every bit as delicious as the descriptions made them sound Wait staff were friendly as always and we greatly enjoyed the experience once again Will always be backIn terms of Burgers this place gets 5 starsI have never had a better burger than their Elk burger combined with crunchy iceberg lettuce dill pickles an egg and the Truffle aioliI usually dont like chicken or turkey burgers but this one is amazing as well  I was completely shocked at how good it was when trying a bite of a friends chicken burgerThe hormone free beef is simple and good as well  Although sadly I cannot tell the difference between the regular beef and the Wagyu burgerThe baked beans as a side are tremendousAny bar that makes their drinks with fresh squeezed fruit is top notch in my bookThis place does it rightTheir burgers are in a word extraordinary  Far better than the other gourmet burger joints BRGR and Wingarts    I am not a chef so I cant say why these are so much better  My guess is that it starts with their selection of the choicest meats and goes from there We last went to Burgatory on Friday night celebrating Valentines Day  my husbands birthday  Yes it is packed  PACKED  It is a smallish restaurant serving remarkable food for reasonable prices  So yeah its going to be a little popular  But when we arrived I gave the server my cell number I received a text telling us that our table would be ready in 1:10  1:20 and we went home to change from work clothes and check in with kid  When we were leaving again got the text that our table was ready we walked in and walked straight to our table  Just like the fancy folk do in NYC  Felt like RockefellersThey also have an app that is works even better than this We didnt know about it until after our date  Will use that next timeBut its the food  the FOOD  that brings everyone to a small corner of Waterworks Mall  The burgers are meals  I had the special of the day a Wagyu beef and aioli concoction Id seen on their Facebook page  Ordered and received it raremedrare  My husband had the crab burger  He also tried a couple of choices from their varied  selection of bottled beers  He enjoys trying new beers  After dinner we finished by splitting a wickedly good milkshake  We chose the CaramelPretzel unspiked  Burgatory is worth the wait  MMmmmmmI gve this a 45 stars  I usually go to the burgatory by robinson mall but I was around waterworks one time and tried this location  Both locations are pretty much the same to me  The Robinson location might be a little bigger  The burgers are always good shakes are amazing service is good  I think its cool how you can make your own burgers and they have wagyu beef which is delish and if you have an adventurous palate they also have elk and bison burgers both of which my fiance said he loved  He said the elk was lean  He had it cooked medium and liked it that way  They also serve them with these homemade chips that are so tastyI love the shakes here and they give you both the glass and the ones in the tin so they give you a lot compared to the ones they serve at brgr  You can take the rest to go aa long as it doesnt have alcohol of course  Burgatory hands down beats BRGR at milkshake battle  My fave is the salted nutella crunch which they can spike with chocolate vodka  Im drooling just thinking about this shakeThe only downside is that they dont take reservations and its really crowded around happy hour time to close One time my friends and I had to wait 2 hours  We went several times during lunch time at the one in Robinson and never had to wait but at the Waterworks location we went on a tuesday afternoon around 1:30 and there was a wait so luckily the bar had room so we just chose to sit thereDefinitely one of my fave placesThis place is amazing They start out by using the nowait app which allows them to text you when your table is ready so you dont have to stand there in the restaurant waiting you can go shop around the plaza It is a nice change of pace One suggestion I make is if you are going to get the Shakes share with someone else because a shake and a burger from here is just TOO much SO DELICIOUS though I typically make my own  but the last time I was there I had the crab cake sandwich and it was Im fairly certain the best crab cake sandwich I have ever tasted They have a different list of beers on draft when youre there so thats always fun They recommend asking the waiter but when a friend of mine asked the waiter what the sangria tasted like her response was idk im not 21 so i cant drink it as if that was somehow our fault Tip to any waiter or waitress if you dont know find out the answer because it caused my friend to then not order a drink and just get the standard free water It was a very rude way to handle the question Our waitress was not polite and when we were ready to free up the table and move to the bar to finish watching the hockey game she was nowhere to be found  Ill tell you though this isnt the typical service I get at this restaurant the wait staff is usually VERY VERY helpful and friendly Their onion rings are to die for They used to have a buffalo chicken dip that was really good too  though I didnt see it on the menu when I was there last Overall you wont be disappointed The atmosphere is just like any other bartype restaurant Everything on the menu is delicious Ive been with multiple different people and have never heard a bad thing about it Give it a tryThis place actually rules When I moved to Pittsburgh in August locals were very eager to throw their suggestions at me as far as what I needed to experience Burgatory was a recurring theme that I was quick to investigate Yes youre going to wait half a day to get in but set aside some time and check it out The atmosphere is great for going out with friends or family and getting chatty The waitstaff is incredibly competent and always willing to offer input and suggestions The drinks are pricey so I usually passNow to the good stuff The food is awesome Every appetizer Ive had the pleasure of trying has been flavorful and well put together the fries are consistently excellent and the milkshakes are the bombcom But of course it is the succulent little beauties composed of beef and heaven that keep me going back Each Burgatory burger is made with love and topped with the finest ingredients known to man I love them So much My suggestion is a Waygu beef patty on Brioche with egg Cheddar cheese and mushrooms"

    "review":"I love the location of this deli You could tell its old school  I ordered a Pittsburgh fav the Ruben  and other memebers in our party had turkey sandwich fries and the veggie burger  I was impressed with the meat quality Soo tender and flavorful The bread on the Ruben was overcooked it was nearly burned and very greasy  But the meat over shadowed thatlol My fam loved all the sandwich but our frieswere dark brown as if the have been cooked in overly used oil disgustingWe spent 55 on three sandwiches and friespricey muchMy wife wanted deli so we went here  Boy was that a mistake Her corned beef was brown and bad My lean pastrami was  okay a bit better than edible  My dad liked his salad  The kids liked their turkey and hot dog  So far two and a half stars The real reason for the single star was the cole slaw  It was off  As in spoiled  I had my salad eating father confirm the fact he had to spit it out  When I brought it to the counter and told them the guy was nice enough to offer me another side He then tossed the slaw without so much as a sniff I fear for subsequent patronsWhen I am in the Strip District this is the place I always go to for a fresh salad or sandwich You can eat there or on the go Their portions are huge ans they have a big menu for being a deli It is also nice because rhey have their own parking and its away from all of the shops that the Strip has to offerOrdered a pastrami Reuben and it was the best Ive ever had Like others have said it was huge there was a lot of meat However the balance of meat and sauerkraut was just right Best of all the sauce didnt overwhelm the sandwich The second half of the sandwich even tasted great the next day although it was a little dry since I warmed it up in the microwave I would definitely go back againIts a terrible thing when you work next to a New York style deli terrible  Oh shoot I forgot my lunch today  Guess Ill just have go grab a sandwichYou really cannot go wrong with the Smallman Street Deli  Though around noon it gets pretty packed you can call your order in ahead to avoid the line  Whether you desire a Rueben burger or homemade soup youll leave thinking you were in NYCThe princing is a tad on the high end for a deli but everything is cooked to order and fresh  There are some seats available  outdoor seating in the warmer months tooIf youre in the Strip and want a sandwich stop by Smallman Street DeliI religiously order the same thing at both locations and it is excellent each time: the turkey rachael on sourdough instead of rye The matzo ball soup while not like moms is still very tasty Fellow diners I have eaten with have ordered the corned beef the roast beef and the pastrami and have raved about them all I highly recommend this authentic deli"

    "review":"Absolutely delicious family run Italian restaurant Yes even if you have a reservation you may wait a few minutes to be seated but the service and food are so fantastic that it more than makes up for the wait The house salad is the best in town I love the gnocchi but if you are looking for a steak the filet mignon and risotto was also deliciousGreat food atmosphere and staff  You can tell this is a family owned business that really cares about the experience of their customers  The salads are very tasty with a light dressing I recommend the Cheese ravioli in a blush sauceOur reservation was for 6:15 but did not get seated till 7:05 ridiculous It then took another 20 minutes to get wine glasses  The old Italian guyownermanager who is obviously drunk had a loud verbal argument with a waiter where they threatened and shoved each other right next to our table This made everyone extremely uncomfortable Other reviewers used nice words for the atmosphere but it is extremely cramped and loud not the intimate atmosphere others claimed We got our meals at 8:00 it was good but not great Not worth the price  The old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress Besides the uncomfortable environment he created he really just got in the way as this place is extremely cramped and hard to walk between tables  So my friends got desert and I caved and got tiramisu it was very soggy like it had been frozen not good  So be aware they added an automatic 20 gratuity to the check The problems were not necessarily the waitresss fault this place is just poorly run  I cant over state how uncomfortable of environment it was between the cramped seating and the verbal and physical altercations between managerowner and employees  Life is too short to waste you time and money on this placeFood service and atmosphere were excellent I dont ever post reviews but couldnt believe this place didnt have a higher ratingPretty nice place in a very quaint setting  I had the spinach ravioli and it was fantastic  Reasonably priced  Enjoyed the intimate atmosphereMy favorite Italian restaurant in PittsburghI often get one of the specials: Carne or Pesce Their salads are amazing The starter salad that comes with most entrees is great  and you can get it in a larger format as a chicken salad for lunch I also love the escarole and beans with sausage My wife loves the Gnocchi and the seasonal raviolis Great wines by the glass Theyll put you on the list if you call ahead"

    "review":"The seafood Mac  Cheese was fantastic along with the honey chili wings  Great ambiance with quality service tooStopped by early on a Saturday night to see what the whole modern comfort food thing was about I ordered the land mac and cheese which had chicken chunks of meatballs and some short rib mixed in It was delicious The cheese sauce was outstanding the sriracha topping added just a little spice and the meat was really good The portions were very big  I ate the 2nd half for lunch the next day The side salad was good and not boring at all and the dessert was excellentThe service was very friendly and I liked the modern decor The cocktails were good The beer and wine lists are a little limited honestly so is the menu but the selection was enough that we could find something They do have a small kids menu and they are on NoWait so you can always get a table Other reviews mentioned that the menu was a bit pricey  Id probably agree with thatThe place was finally full around 630pm on a Saturday Parking in Regent Square can be tricky  parking on a side street is recommended Overall a place Id go againWent for lunch today The crab cake salad was unbelievable My husband got the bahn mi and said it is his new favorite sandwich We are excited to go back to try more dishes We might always get the crab cakes as an app just to have them Seriously very good Staff was very helpful and attentive Yeah prices are a bit pricey for lunch but so worth it for fresh food and good serviceGreat restaurant The food was amazing and the service was excellent We had a fabulous seat by the huge window which brightened up the experience The crab cake the hanger steak and finally the ice cream sandwich were delicious This place is perfect for a casual night out for a date or with the family Were definitely going backFood: The American Bohm Mi sandwich is wonderful The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot Price: Pricey for lunch but the ingredients were fresh and the meal was crafted Decor: Beautiful and comfy I like the color the floors are stained Nice jobService: The server was very attentive Overall: I will be backHubby and I went on a Friday night 7pm moderately busy  I ordered a peach sangria and hubby a Moscow Mule both were pricey but you could actually feel the alcohol  We both ordered saladskale Caesar and a wedge delish  For our entrees I had the cedar plank salmon which was perfectly cooked and hubby had the ahi tuna he loved it  Love the new atmosphere we will be back to try some of the other creative entrees soon"

    "review":"Average Mexican more chainlike Their house marg is pretty good and hh specials are cheapIf youre unsure or if your your significant other is anything like mine  and cant make up their mind where to eat dont second guess this place  We just moved from California where in every corner there is a Mexican restaurant and Ive never been to a place like this The food in just four wordsout of this world From the moment youre greeted to the friendly servers  to the friendly guacamole maker table side to the amazing food and until you leave this place is spectacular  Juan and his wife Danielle the owners and host are of the friendliest most noble people I have ever met They literally treat you like family I felt like VIP The decor of the restaurant is very authentic and has a very nice vibe to it  The ambient music was awesome  and made me feel like I was in Mexico and made feel like I should start dancing with my wife by the table I strongly recommend this restaurant  Try the carne asada or the choripollo Chorizo and chicken see photos Also try the empanada appetizer To die for This place opened up just about 6 weeks ago And the place was full That only tells you one thing  Its popular and very delicious This was on a Wednesday night  Be sure to go for brunch too They have a while different menu for brunch So if youre on the fence to try something new or if for some reason some negative Nancy left a bad review dont pay attention to it  This place and this review is the real deal GOOOOOO You wont regret it  and youll thank me later EnjoyDisappointed food was bland and the mixed drinks are weak  Had the fish tacos and chimichanga with an on the rocks margarita and mojitio  Fish tacos order had 3 but with really enough ingredients for 2  The slaw was blah and in general not tasty  The chimichamga was decent size but no flavor and didnt bother to finish  Both mixed drinks where very weak and the mojitio was especially disappointing with very very little mint and not muddled  The service was great and the dcor and atmosphere of the restaurant where pleasing which bumped up my rating  Wish I was eating some yummy street tacos or Beas insteadThe chicken tacos were amazing the salsa was amazing but the margarita sealed the deal Will be back often People around me ordered queso and guacamole which they made in front of them cant wait to tryExcellent place I am from Mexico City and the food here is very traditional and delicious  The people is very friendly and fast service Dont forget to order some margaritas So weve been to Totopo several times now and have had no noteworthy complaints so far  We decided hit Totopo for brunch on Sunday for fathers day  The kids saw that they had pancakes and waffles on the menu topped with all kinds of sugar and were excited to be going  We got seated and ordered  A few mins later our server came back and infomed us that the brunch items werent availble  WTF  Im not sure why they have it listed on the menu if its not available  I also dont understand why the server wasnt aware of the brunch items not being available until the order was put in at the kitchen  The story we got was that they wouldnt be offering the brunch items for a while yet  Theyve been open for like a month now  why not block the items off of the menus if they cant be ordered  Why not inform the wait staff   SOMEONE has had to have tried to order these items before this past Sunday  Makes no sense  Its not the end of the world but the brunch menu was the main reason we went there for fathers day so it was quite a let down"

    "review":"I usually pass over this restaurant in favor of the Qdoba on Sixth Nothing special and also the restaurant is very narrow and you have to squeeze pass people entering the restaurant to get to the fountain drink machine  This Qdoba is poorly laid out and I never feel completely comfortable eating here I often wonder if because of my size I get served less food My tacos are always filled with the tiniest bit of filling at this Qdoba Yes I may be a small person but I am paying the same price as the next person So it does annoy me when Im served less and this happens all the time here I cannot get full eating even 3 tacos at this Qdoba its not a good value for my moneyNothing special move alongAs fast food goes I generally avoid it like the plague that it has become but when our company received an envelope full of twoforone coupons with my limited choices for decent and affordable lunches downtown on days that Id not prepped something at home Qdoba won me for at least a try and they became like my fifth in line for something to eat downtownThese coupons were only good for this one specific location downtown so this location got usI have to say I wasnt disappointed and over the course of the next two months we went through quite a few of these coupons Almost every time we went in the place was really busy but theyve divided it into two lines One for burritos only and the other for the rest and it seems to work out rather well for keeping a smooth and timely flow The food itself is pretty good I mean it IS fast food so the crew from The Chew wont be standing in line to assess its gourmet goodness but considering the crap that most conveyor belt fast fooderies crank out Qdoba actually puts out a decent edible and I dare say even tasty product Ive gotten steak burritos and nachos and neither have disappointed They are decent sized filling and come with that thing that eludes a lot of fast food factoriesflavor Its not what Id call cheap nor is it expensive For what you get its about right The steak doesnt taste like freeze dried dog food and the additives like guacamole and cheese are fresh Additionally the staff at this particular location isnt the usual paperhatted lineup of minimum wage zombies Some of them are actually kind of adorable including the little guy who usually starts you off in the burrito line A slightly cherubic guy hes friendly being the starter of the burrito with the tortilla meat and ricebeans seems to genuinely like his customers and then he passes you on to the next staff member who will stuff the remainder of goodies into your burrito and usually theyre just as friendly All in all this is a nice option for a downtown quick lunch Decent food ok prices pleasant staff and a quick inandout A chain worth linking withDowntown Pittsburgh PA Even though Im not a big fan of Mexican food I like this concept for business Cutting down on bread is a great idea using the naked burrito concept I have been in Qdoba before never ate because it reminded me of a salad and it wasnt what I wanted to eat then So Mike S tells me to try it It was great because I get to add what I like and tasted fine But I guess you are kind of your own chef hereDecent food though they dont put much meat in the burritos  The front door is left open so The dining room ends up being about 50 degrees in the winter time so its pretty uncomfortable to sit down to eatIm not a big fan of Qdoba and more than likely will never eat there again My office ordered the Taco Bar for 20 people They gave us a huge bag of tortillas but the queso was extra we ordered ground meat and chicken and the rest of it came with 8oz of lettuce medium salsa hot salsa sour cream guacamole and pico de galo well the lettuce was just big enough for a salad for one person and wasnt even filled to the edge of the small container and the ground meat didnt even fill the aluminum pan to the edge we received 40 hard shell tacos of which nobody ate and 20 soft shell All the sauces were in 8oz containers within an 40 minutes all the sour cream ground meat and lettuce for one person was gone and nobody went back twice it was 211 and some change which made it 1177 each so i paid 1177 for 3 soft tacos ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT nothing that came with this taco package would make me spend my money there ever again i didnt realize lettuce was that expensive they gave us a huge bag of tortillas which was useless without queso but i would think that it would cost more to make or get the tortillas then it would to buy lettuce It was patheticThe manager later brought over complimentary queso and extra ground meat and salsa"

    "review":"The food is great and affordable Had the Helen over fries Very original place with friendly staff Cant wait to go backGreat place for breakfast  I have no idea what was in the pancakes but they are amazingThis diner is really homey and comfortable It really is a locals spot and probably one of their favorites many of the people coming in and out seem to know each other I kept it traditional and had the Junior French Toast and it was delicious Also I had pineapple juice which isnt really offered many other places If youre in town and you want to eat where the locals eat this is your spot Oh and to top it off there is a parking lot right beside the dineryou dont have to park on the streetIf you like old small town types of diners this is a surprising find in Wilkinsburg  I happened to be nearby and found this on Yelp  The decor is a bit dated  but not bad at all  Menu is fairly typical small diner fare  I got a greek omelet with home fries and toast  The food was simple and tasted homemade and the homefries were tasty  Interestingly I got them with peppers on it and the peppers were generously piled on top  but had a slightly tangy vinegar like taste  from that and the texture they seem to have been pickled  It tasted a bit odd  but it was still very tasty  From pictures other Yelpers posted I have seen home fries with fresh peppers so maybe they just ran out  This is a simple reasonably priced little diner in Wilkinsburg that also has plenty of parking  a nice plus for me for this type of place  It is a metered lot where I think 1 quarter bought me 1 hour and 15 minutes  The best part about this place was the staff  Anyone can tell immediately that I am not from the area  and I can sometimes been stared at like an alien when going to some of the smaller towns around Pittsburgh  Here I felt comfortable and welcome and was greeted with smiles  I will go to this place again when I am in the areaAlso they serve breakfast all dayWhats not to love local diner totally artisan breakfast sandwiches retro atmosphere but modern twists on classics Grits and her specialized hangoverhelpers are fav Great couple owns the place hired personable people Nothing worse than a diner with disgruntled staff This place is the 5star diner of East End yes rivals Square Cafe and Point Bruge just the atmosphere is totally retro diner and not all Bistro looking Delicious breakfast  The pancakes are pretty good but a hangover helper makes this my favorite weekend spot Its an omelette served over the best freshcut fries around Also they have sausage made out of bacon Just let that sink in"

    "review":"Great bar 36 drafts with a great beer selection Had the BBQ belly burger and fries which were awesome  Staff is totally on the ball too They talk to my group of four and refer to our names throughout our visit Great addition to the southsidenUrban Tap had the best Bloody Mary Ive ever had  The Bloody Mary bar was solid  We came here because I heard that UT had one of the best brunches in the burgh and I thought it was very good I ordered the Omelet with sausage peppers and onions and it was very good  It was served with a small side of diced potatoes  The portions were kind of small and the food was goodbut I dont know that I would say best brunch in the burghWe had a large party 9 people and the service was a bit slow which is unusual for UT  Great atmosphere and great draft list  I dont know that I would return for brunch howeverThis is a pretty trendy but fairly standard gastropub The drink selection is good and varied between craft beers cidars and wine The decor is industrial but not as far as steam punk though the latter would be very cool Ive only had the apps here They are very tasty but pretty common place Overall a good place to go but not a destination in and of itselfFirst time at Urban Tap and I have to say that everything I had was good I ordered a chicken dish that I must have misread because I thought it was going to be a grilled chicken dish Ive been trying to eat a little lighter so I thought it would be a good choice What I got was fried chicken covered in gravy with potatoes and sauted greens While it wasnt what I expected I was not disappointed The chicken was crispy and the gravy was flavorful The potatoes I couldnt have cared less about but the greens were amazing Some of the best Ive ever had I asked the waiter what was on the greens and he told me apple cider vinegar and red pepper flakes but there has to be something they are hiding These greens were special and I am determined to find out the secret My boyfriend got the pulled pork burger and had a pretty clean plate by the end All around I loved my meal and was not upset that I didnt get grilled chickenIts been about 2 weeks since I actually ate here but better late than never rightSo I loved the setting at Urban Tap It had that hip dare I say Urban vibe to it and it was well done Located right in the heart of South Side and conveniently next to a small parking lot Urban Tap is in my opinion the perfect spot for after work meet ups happy hour dinner whatever your mood may be  Our server was totally on point He suggested the mojito for my drink and it was amazing For my appetizer I ordered the Brussel sprouts what else right and they were great Not the best Brussels Ive had but still really good For my dinner I ordered the chicken sandwich again at our servers suggestion and just like the Brussel sprouts it wasnt life changing but I liked it and of course cleared my plate no sense in being wasteful after all We definitely enjoyed our evening at Urban Tap and Im already looking forward to our next visit :Ive been a few times for drinks and the space has a cool vibe but recently went for Sunday brunch Place opened at 11 we were some of the first there and had to wait about 30 mins for our food I got the eggs benedict never a question when its on the menu and I was turned off by how salty the biscuit and cornbread were The proportions of the dish were also off so I had trouble getting egg biscuit and meat and sauce all in one bite My friend ordered the same and we both were very disappointed Others in our group got burgers which they said were good but with the slow service and the disappointing dish Im not sure if Ill make this a regular stop"

    "review":"This place should be packed every single night The staff is well trained so polite and really some of the nicest people around The menu offers a wide range something for everyone They were fantastic with our large group aging from 5 to 65 I cant recommend this place enough Oh And the vegetable quesadilla was most excellentTraveling on business me and my family wanted something nice but not too expensive We decided to try cafe sams out as it was close to our hotel I cannot give enough stars to this restaurant as they have exceeded our expectations in every way The service was amazing the prices were very honest the owners made my wife feel very comfortable that having our 2 yr old with us as he can sometimes be a little noisy The food was to die for as we couldnt stop eating once until our meals were done When we come to Pittsburgh again we will definitely be making it a priority to stop at sams cafe again Again we will be recommending this place to everyone and anyone 10 out of 5 stars will recommend to anyone for a great nightAs much as I love the food here Im sad to say this is likely our last time coming here I realize that coming as a party of 5 on Saturday night without a reservation is usually tough to accommodate yet I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess told me they would move a table around and it would be about 10 minutes We waited for 1520 minutes and watched about 4 parties get sat before we asked what was taking so long since she had told us they were just moving a table The hostess was very defensive and said that we shouldnt expect to get sat so soon without a reservation on a Saturday night so we asked why she told us it would be 10 minutes She then said that she needed to seat people with reservations before she could seat us and completely refused to acknowledge that she had given us a misleading wait time I understand that its hard to guage wait times but when youre wrong you should simply apologize and not blame the guests for how they planned their evening When we finally got sat our server Angel was very good and the Buffalo style salmon steak is delicious I really like the food here but the fact of the matter is their customer service tonight was inexcusable Even when the customer is wrong you dont blame them and say Im sorry but You simply apologize and try to defuse the situation instead of getting defensive and escalating the situation If the hostess had simply said I apologize for the wait taking longer than expected we should be able to seat you in 5 minutes and thanked us for our patience there would never have been an issue I love the food but I wont be coming backThe mannequin in this place is really creepy and weird  It throws you off because you would think that the place would be horrible if they keep the creepiness flowing but it does give you something to talk about  And amazingly enough the food is good creative and the service is not bad  I do notice that we have gotten newer nervous server the last two times that I went  Well those were the only two times I have been  She didnt screw anything up but had to ask us many times it was ok to do this or the other thing  Not a big deal because she was nice and thorough  We got the frog legs for appetizers and also the calamari  Both item are breaded and not really that impressive  I have actually had better calamari other places and the frog legs were kind of just ok  It was kind of a hey let me just try this for fun kind of thing because it is an exotic sort of item  For my main I had roasted red pepper and basil pasta which was really quite good  I really enjoyed it  I think that alot of people would like the fact that Sams has a wide wide in fact huge selection of menu items  I dont always need an oversized menu  Usually if a place concentrates on a smaller range of things it comes out with better quality  Sams is bold in attempting to tackle all those items  Most times I think that they pull it off  My only gripe is that maybe they could change up the beers a little bit  Maybe feature a few local offerings from small batch craft breweries  Yah they are always a good place to go for some solid eats  Cheers guysGreat experience Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers Most of the items we had for dinner appetizers entrees and dessertWonderful food and excellent service Staying at the family house on Centre Ave and this restaurant was a nice place to relax and eat a good meal The hospital doesnt offer healthy choices in their cafeteria so I appreciated the change 11214 update Ate here againtwo nights in a row Food was great but service was pretty bad Waitress not attentive at allmade assumptions about me being finished  never checked back to see if everything was ok never asked if I wanted anything else Gotta drop from 5 to 4 stars"

    "review":"Our group of 4 was seated 40 minutes later than our reservation without an apology from anyone After the meal we found the service was so slow it was no wonder why we were seated so late Food was cold and quite bland I ordered the chefs sampler menu and only the bananas foster was above average The worst part of the night was having to ask for the manager after never receiving so much as an apology for having to wait so long for a reserved table The manager Tony had no idea and could not have cared less One of the worst dining experiences Ive had in Pittsburgh If you are looking for a nice place on Mount Washington Monterey Bay is about the same price point with much better food and vastly superior service Although your local Applebees would have better servicethe best view from mount washingtonso so food  cant remember one dish from having been there 34 times the last two yearsreceived very bad service one visit  manager very apologetic and offered to not charge us for the meal  we declined and ordered  dessert insteadThe building and view are beautiduland thats the only reason why I gave it two stars The waitress had limited knowledge on fine dining cuisine the calimari was over cooked so we told the waitress she returned it to the kitchen and came back out asking if we wanted something else and declines to remake the dish stating thats just how they make it they wont make the dish again because thats how they cook it and it will come out the same way My father asked for fresh lime in his beverage and the waitress said shell have to check and see if they have any limes that they didnt have many in stock The young man filling our water and butter on the table was smacking gum so loud you could hear it across Pittsburgh He also refilled our table water by reaching over us so instead of pulling the water glass off the table and pouring it properly he poured the water with the glass directly ont to the table resulting in spilling ice cubes  I had chucks of solid cheese in my pasta that wasnt melted missing tomatoes my dads escargot was over cooked my boyfriends steak was flavorful but a poor cut of meat  they ran out of half of their dessert options Overall they are just stuck in the 1970s with their black tie outfits and old school menu Save your money enjoy the view from the overlook and find another restaurant with better qualityI recently attended a fashion show and luncheon for Genesis of Pittsburgh at the LeMont and I was so impressed  Our food both passed hors doeuvres and our luncheon entree of Chicken Bruschetta was fantastic  It was bright light flavorful and perfect for an afternoon lunch  The service was wonderful from the servers to the bartenders everyone was professional and courteous yet also friendly and personable  Of course you cant speak about the LeMont without mentioning the unique atmosphere which truly is breathtaking and worthy of special occasions  There is something very special about a room with a view like that and I did pause and take a minute to think about how beautiful our city is  The decor inside is lavish and impressive  I told my husband later that we dont dine at the LeMont often enough and he agreed  Our city has a vibrant dining scene and part of that is this classic that really is such a wonderful Pittsburgh tradition  We will be back very soonI have gone here twice with my husband the last time in January to celebrate my birthday : both times we have experienced exceptional services and wonderful food And of course the view is breathtaking I would highly recommend dining hereHosted colleagues from regions throughout North America in March  Great view of our city  Wonderful veteran Pittsburgh wait staff  Lots of choices for everyone on the menu and a welcoming and beautiful atmosphere"

    "review":"Angela C could not be more accurate  Im troubled to give it a 2 or 3 but Ill go with the 3 because its just so freakin cheap  Weirdest place ever though the randomly gigantic selection of alcohol the underground entrance and the mere fact that its korean fast food  The food is mostly  not that great except for the fried rice which is beyond tasty  And its like 375 or something ridiculous  So you can get a soda and fried rice which will more than fill you up with just a 5 bill  This place is fun though check it out for sureMy friends and I always used to get a kick out of going for ghetto Korean food as we called it I loved the spicy fried noodles I tend to like everything to be spicy but this stuff was to the level you could barely eat it I dont know why but that made it all the more appealing to me Yum I do miss those noodlesThis is one of the strangest restaurants ever The entrance is an almosthidden door at the corner of a block that leads you into a narrow notsoclean staircase down into the basement You might mistaken buying lunch for buying some other questionable things but rest assure youre going the right way At the bottom of the stairs youll see a door that only opens if youre still standing on the stairs because otherwise it will hit you Okay now youre in the restaurant When you first walk in youll find a row of refrigerators with beverages like you would at a gas station convenient store The difference is that the whole row is filled with beer all kinds of beer You can get 40s 6packs of domestic imports hard lemonades etc After describing all that the weirdest part is this is a fastfood Korean restaurant You can get bulgogi kalbi duk in soup kim chi etc Weird right The food is decent and its a great lunch spot in the heart of Oakland If you havent been here just the experience is worth the trip"

    "review":"I am addicted to Pizza Palermo Great flavor I love the ranch sauce combined with valentina and authentic Palermo Pizza just for 10 unbeatable pricevalueAs the old adage goes you pay for what you get This is true of Pizza Palermo The food is reasonably priced and thus tastes reasonable Dont expect to be blown awaythis isnt the best pizza in Pittsburgh see Aiellos Mercurios or Il Pizaiolo for that but it still tastes good and is super convenient if you live in Shadyside I would however recommend getting toppings on the pizza For some reason the plain cheese pizza comes out pretty greasy The hoagies are also solid Definitely recommended As far as pizza goes you could do A LOT worse in this townIn my mind  this place is pretty solid The sandwiches are tasty  the pizza hits the spot service is adequate and they have 8 lunch specials They have a fairly extensive menu as wellId recommend the Italian hoagie I think they do it quite well here The half is plenty for one person Its a great spot just a 10 minute walk from Walnut and seems to literally always be open Im pleasedThe worst gyros I have ever had No meat in it and it was not cheap Stay away from this place I will not be going back here again I was impressed with how big their menu is given how small the actual place is  There were numerous pasta hoagie burger appetizer salad calzone stromboli and gyro optionsand pizza of course  I have tried the pizza and the cheese steak hoagie  I would go back for the pizza but not the cheese steak  There are plenty of tables to enjoy lunch at or dinner if you wanted but I wouldnt really consider this a dinein dinner location  They do have delivery and takeout which are probably the primary business  Catering options are available for large gatheringsI had wings and a pie The wings was over fried and way to greasy  The pie was a 510  Not really a lot of flavor Service was horrible Was like I was a burden to them Not coming back"

    "review":"We went to Ten Penny on the 2nd day that they were open We tried a lot of things on the menu starting with the crispy brussels sprouts I am seeing more and more brussels sprouts showing up in restaurants these days but the ones at Ten Penny were amazing They had bacon Jack Daniels sauce and blue cheese mixed in with the brussels sprouts I loved themNext we had the osso buco and the American clam bakeThe food came out in these cast iron containers and it was neatThe clam bake was pretty good I liked the ale that they used to steam everything in I used my bread to soak all of the juice up and it was good The osso buco was very tasty as wellWe finished off with the smores and the salted caramel pretzel torte The smores were a lot of work and not the best but the salted caramel pretzel torte was unreal The caramel was homemade and so goodThey had complimentary sparkling water which was so tasty They also had 24 beers on tap none of which were domestics Which is a huge winOverall it was really good especially smooth for being open for a short amount of time You will not be disappointed with the ambiance eitherGo hereAwesome food Really cool industrial environment very Pittsburgh Waiter was a little slow and had no personalityLove the interior That was the best part Its what I would call industrial chic and reminded me of a cool downtown loft There were lots of windows so lots of natural lightWe stopped in for a meal around the 3:00 hour I was disappointed to find a very limited lunch menu that was also cross billed as a late night menu I was told it was because the kitchen was already prepping for dinner Something to keep in mind if you want to eat between tradional meal timesBecause our visit coincided with National Margarita Day I had one Very sad It tasted like sweet  sour margarita mix and thats about all Granted Im from California where we know our margaritas but this was way below averageFor my meal I chose the chicken sandwich It came with melted cheddar cheese and was on what seemed to be a homemade bun Tasty The French fries which accompanied it had a good flavor I especially liked the rough texture of their outsides Daughter had the green Thai chicken While she said it wasnt bad it also didnt taste like the authentic version youd get in a real Thai restaurantI went with the Creme Brle trio for desserta unique idea which paid off One was orange infused one was peppermint which tasted better than it sounds and one was hot chocolate with marshmallow fluff on top Apparently flavors rotate so ask on your visitEh That about sums up the brunch experience at ten penny They do not have many choices for what you would expect for brunch I had the omelet and it was subpar They messed up my order and another persons order at my table and fixed it but it was still not good Very bland Others meals were not that good either Bloody Mary selection for 10 seems like a pretty good deal But some tasted very strange with various liquor in them Overall I would not go back for brunch Prices are reasonable but for what you get it would be better to go to eatin park Pamelas or even eleven for brunch   Spend more and enjoy your foodSkip the brunch Atmosphere is really neat reason for 2 starsNice interiorrugged very Pittsburgh Steel City fo sho Hockey on the tube bonus pointsThe selection of draftsnice I opted for a local artisan cidervery good very pricey Worth itThe foodgood Very good The Shrimp Trio appetizer was quality tasty Had a Mediterranean flatbread which was overly salty and passable but not something Id order again The tomato bisque OK Get something elseThe glazed salmon was excellent Nice presentation and the accompanying flavors were well balanced Overall the place is priced well and makes the effort to prepare exceptional food even if they miss here and there Definitely a place Id return to if it were convenientFirst time there I was pleasantly pleased with the decor  Waitress was attentive serving our appetizer very quickly  We had the Mediterranean Flatbread Lacking in much flavor wouldnt order again  We had the Scallops which were very tender but the Ahi tuna plate had to go back because nothing was hot on the plate  The manager came over quickly to apologize and made the new plate That was good with generous portion of tuna   Green beans very fantastic   Drinks are reasonably priced which is nice to see for a change  We will try this place again"

    "review":"Excellent fast food thats not terribleMy wife and I got lunch here today around 12:30  The line was very long but it moved quickly and efficiently  My only complaint is that they didnt have steak ready for my wifes salad but she only had to wait a few minutesAs far as Chipotles go the Market Square location is probably one of my least favorites but if Im in a hurry itll suffice The staff always seems like they have something better to do and we are interrupting their fun Ive been there a few times now and its been the same every timeThe store itself is pretty nice and reasonably clean for the amount of traffic that it gets Its nearly always busy but the lines move quickly The food is onpar with any other Chipotle that youll go to but just know that you may encounter long lines sometimes limited seating and a little attitude from the staffToday while I waited in line there was a little tiff between a couple of employees behind the line  It was kind of awkward but it reminded me that Ive been meaning to write a review about this Chipotle location  Chipotle employees are always pretty cheerful but these guys are commendable  Theyre dealing with outthedoor lines every day at this location and are always smiling when I finally get to the front  Even today with what could have become an incident the manager handled the situation immediately and the cashier gracefully stepped in to finish my order  I love Chipotle in general but enjoy this location particularly  Nice job all aroundIve been to many Chipotle locations and this one isnt very good Cramped layout inefficient staff and no parking Portion size is below average I do realize that this has a lot to do with the person serving you The restaurant is not sparkling clean and the sodautensils area needs to be tidied up The food tasted okay but the salsa was not as fresh as many other locationsUh oh Ive stumbled upon what will now be one of my favorite spots for lunch in downtown PittsburghI just recently started working in downtown and have been trying out a lot of new lunch places A lot of my friends are Chipotle fans but I had only been several times throughout the country and never quite understood their love for itExcept that changed yesterday Im not sure what lured me into Chipotle but something did The environment is very attractive and trendy with lots of seats lining the windows overlooking Forbes and Market Square It makes for a great zoneout peoplewatching lunch that is often needed midday when you work in an office with no windowsThe prices are inexpensive and the quality of food is exceptional Why have I been going to Qdoba and Moes all these years I just wanted to kick myself for somehow overlooking how great Chipotle is all this timeI highly recommend the Burrito Bowl the featured item when I went yesterday Very tasty and filled with fresh ingredients Plus I didnt feel like it was very bad for me with its mix of chicken rice and toppings OK now I might just be deceiving myself but just go with it for meIf you didnt guess already based on my review Ill be back"

    "review":"I had an awesome freshly prepared wrap and delicious soup If you want to eat healthy easy and delicious this is the place downtown This seems to be the only place like it in the area and Im so glad to have this option for a quick lunch or a dinner pickup on the way homeI had passed this place a bunch of times on my commute into work every day and definitely was excited to see a healthyfast spot open up we need more in PghHave to be honest though that my salad tasted like a McDonalds salad I had some yucky pieces of lettuce in mine the chicken was kind of spongey and the tortilla chip crunchies just didnt taste good I dunno not for me I had the southwestern chicken salad Ill definitely give it another shot Hopefully my next one is better Ill be rooting for this placeA great place to grab something nutritious light and quick  I travel to Pittsburg for work so it is nice to have a reliable place with fresh and healthy ingredients  The staff is always happy and friendly tooI usually get my salad fix from Earth formerly known as Tosst but after reading the reviews here I decided to give Simple Ingredients a try for lunch today I was greeted warmly when walked into the little place and I didnt feel rushed as I looked over the menu to decide what I wanted I was feeling more in the mood for salmon than chicken so I choose the Super Foods Salad with the tomato basil dressing The people behind the counter were personable and while I my salad was being made I learned that this place is owned by the same people who own SalsAs one other person on here pointed out there is no seating in Simple Ingredients part of what makes it so simple I suppose so I took my bagged Super Foods Salad to my office and enjoyed it at my desk My first impression was how fresh everything in the salad tasted The tomato basil worked well with the spinach kale and edamame and the serving size was just about right I was really surprised by the slice of bread that I got with the salad It seemed stale very uncharacteristic of the rest of the mealIt seems to me that there are mainly two salad joints in the Downtown area both competing against one another: Simple Ingredients and Earth Let me contrast the two Simple Ingredients seems to have slightly fresher produce than Earth does but only very slightly and maybe I just caught them on a delivery day Earth on the other hand offers strawberries blueberries and raspberries something that I really enjoy with my salad and I kind of missed them today I think you get a slightly larger serving of salmon and it comes in one piece at Simple Ingredients but I like the way Earth crumbles it up for you Also Earth applies and mixes the dressing of your choice for you which is good if youre going to consume the salad shortly after purchasing it Whereas Simple Ingredients gives you a tub of their dressing and you can apply it when you see fit Good for those purchasing now for later Both places have their pros and cons but all in all they both produce a very good product and theres enough of a market with the Downtown crowd to support them bothThis place has very fresh friendly and quick service The portions are really big but it is a bit pricey I would honestly rather have a  smaller portion and have it be little less expensive It would be nice if they had a half a salad option There are a ton of ingredients which is great It would be nice if they chopped the salad thoughThis place is excellent  What stood out to me the most was the level of customer service When I arrived there were 2 people behind the counter a girl and a guy  both greeted me and smiled After staring at the menu for a while I said that I couldnt make up my mind The guy asked a couple questions then suggested the manderin chicken salad  and he was right on the money The salad was delicious the ingredients were fresh and the dressing was flavorful and not heavy or oily at all  The only negative thing I could say is that its a little pricey  952 I think for my salad Maybe they should consider a Frequent Salad Eater Card You knowbuy X number of salad and get one free That would definietly motivate me to go back more oftenAlso they didnt have it posted anywhere that theyll mix  chop your salad with or without your dressing before you leave For people like me who often eat at their desks this is a super perkA suggestion: It would be nice to know the fatcalorie content of the dressings"

    "review":"One of the better places for Chinese food in the area in my opinion Definitely more authentic than a lot of similar places around the Oakland area Got the chili chicken pot and it had a lot of chicken chunks with a bunch of veggies in a tasty sauce You can also ask for extra spiciness if feeling adventurousI do miss the Cuban food though Im not sure exactly when they have it but last time I was there we were told that weekend lunch times do not offer the Cuban menuWent there several times Definitely love the selfserviced hot pot They offer all kinds of meat : fish balls shrimps slice of fish shrimp balls  meat balls beef balls and all kinds of vegetables A good place to reunion with some friends and get relaxed after an examCame here with a friend I ordered general tso chicken and he tried to order sweet  sour chicken but was told they were out and they are doing away with the American Chinese because their authentic Chinese is more popular Next time I will have to try Their steamed rice is so fluffy and good Will be back to try the traditional Chinese Thank youFood is good and affordable Back when I was in graduate school my coworker and I came here all the time for lunch Service highly depends on the server The Englishspeaking servers are nice and fast and it seems like they are in charge here I havent been here for a year so I dont know if the staff has changed There is an older Chinese lady who can barely speak English but is very sweet She kept trying to speak Mandarin to me I cant speak Mandarin unfortunately and ordering was almost impossible I can point at the item I want to order on the menu but how am I supposed to get the idea I want it not spicy across through body language Haha I feel a bit torn about this because as a server she is really not up to par but she needs a job who doesnt A lot of patrons here actually speak Mandarin so she can do her job just not for meAnother problem is that one of the younger servers was a bit impatient with my Indian coworker My friend doesnt like soy sauce he claims to have an allergic to soy sauce of course you can ask if hes allergic to soy sauce how come he goes to a Chinese restaurant haha Anyway he put the order in and specifically asked no soy sauce be added to his dish The dish came back with soy sauce mixed in so my friend asked that the order be made correctly again The waitstaff said well we are very busy we cant serve you anymore My friend was mad and he ended up talking to the Englishspeaking server the manager The dish with no soy sauce was finally served I dont know  perhaps the restaurant was really busy at that time and thus the server did not want to deal with soy sauce issue Overall service is hit or miss just like many Chinese restaurants Other than that food is pretty good and inexpensive Good for students on a budget6I LOVE HEREIts real Chinese food Tofu is great Ma La Tang also great just like them in Sichuan or in many places in China A little expensive but dishes are always huge so well deservedWill come back many times"

    "review":"Penn Ave Seafood Cos second location in downtown Pittsburgh  They are open for lunch and dinner serving dinner WED  FRI starting November 10  The menu seems to be virtually the same as the original location in the stripYou can see the menu at their website but basically it consists of all sorts of different sushi rolls and platters  They also have 10 or so 912 sandwiches and 68 other items Tacos pizza that vary with the season from what I can tellHonestly the food is extremely tasty  The sandwiches are always cooked to order and the sauces and aiolis are always quite tasty  The cole slaw and salads that come on the side are also well conceived I had a couscous apple chickpea salad with mine  The ciabatta breads are very tasty but soft enough to be manageable in a sandwich formThe only critique I have at the moment is that the layout is rather awkward  It is sometimes hard to tell if they are even open walking by and it is hard to see the menu board while waiting in lineI hope to return soon and split a sushi platter with friendsBYOBExtremely long wait for expensive mediocre sushi  Cramped and just not worth the price  Just FYI I had a totally different experience in the Strip District shop  Go there insteadWords cannot express how much I love this place I am obsessed with sushi and was sad when we moved to Pittsburgh because I thought I would have to give it up Then we discovered this delightful restaurant Their rolls are fresh and creative and I crave them daily Hands down the best sushi in PittsburghAmazing restaurantLunch dinner sushi soup sandwiches and main fish dishes  Im in Pittsburgh on a long term work assignment and am not sure I would survive without this restaurant  Fresh healthy meals are hard to come by when only eating out and Penn Avenue Fish Company is my favoriteAsk them for their specials unbelievable fresh catches  I used to say I only liked white light notfishy fishs to eat I find myself experimenting and loving it hereThis place has a pretty cool vibe and the food was good as well I could go up to five starts if I eat here a few more times Nice workFirst time Ive had decent nigiri or sashimi in Pittsburgh  There was nothing spectacularly interesting on the menuthe sushi menu I mean I havent sampled their sandwiches or entrees but they looked good but the fish hadnt been frozen and it was cut appropriately  The sushi wouldnt be even remotely notable on the west coast but hey Pittsburgh isnt known for its sushi  Ill happily come here again  Good job guys"

    "review":"Neighborhood chain Good salad barEvery time we come here there is always something that would withhold a positive experience Today our drink order was incorrect No biggie Easy fix Then we waited 10mins to place our order It then took close to 40mins to get our food My fiancs meal was completely the wrong chicken We had both ordered the same chicken Both servers were confused and acted like they had no clue what to do to fix the incorrect meal So they sent it back to the kitchen to remake Meanwhile I ate my food of which the mashed potatoes were only slightly warm while my fianc waited another 10mins for his meal to get fixed We never received our rolls that accompanied our meals and figured why bother saying anything with how terrible everything else was I was asked if I wanted a refill on my beverage and declined after the server once again stated the incorrect beverage I was drinking We never received even an apology the whole time we were there and    The server continuously blamed the kitchen All in all we were there about an hour and 20mins For a meal that should have taken 35mins tops In the past we have turned a cheek to any mishaps during our time at this restaurant but from now on we will go out of our way to another eat n park if we decide to go thereLove Eat N Park its a Pittsburgh staple How can you not eat here Its a good location with friendly staff My only two cons are this1 Having the salad bar right where everyones walking to the kitchen and to their seats its a cluster Especially if your at the salad bar you have the added worry of bumping someone The other one is its not restocked as quickly as it should be Other than that its greatThe criterion that differentiates this Eat n Park location from all the others is its staff  The servers at this location are efficient hardworking a great team and most important truly interested in the welfare of the customers  Were on a firstname basis with the servers and engage in lively conversation on every visit  We look forward to visiting our friends the servers and management at the Freeport Road Eat n ParkEatn Park is a staple here in the Burgh and really who doesnt like getting lunch at an Eatn Park Restaurant Theres always something to enjoy here Burgers sandwiches soups a salad bar pastaand the milkshakes  yum Some restaurants even offer separate rooms for meetings  what better way is there to go over info than over some delicious Eatn Park chowThat said based on my recent experience I do not recommend this location if youre bringing a business group and using the separate room the service for our group wasnt great The staff did not check in on my group frequently at all and we must have had 6 different waiters during the night so we never knew who to flag down for assistance It took quite a long time to get food drinks refills and so forth  longer than it would have if we sat outside in the noisy main areaThis location redeems itself a little from its poor group service since it sells pie slices at its front desk in addition to entire pies not all locations do this and cmon: sometimes theres just no room in my fridge for an entire pie Sadly when I ordered my little slice of pie the woman who handed it to me shoved it into a bag and then gave me the bag handles first without once considering whether she put my pie in upside down or not Since I ordered a creme pie and this caused a bit of a mess it was an admittedly first world problem inconvenience that could have been easily solved with a little awarenessBut hey otherwise an Eatn Park is an Eatn Park  fairly fresh and simply yummy I am a huge fan of their burgers  both meat AND veggie  as well as their Alfredo dinner salads and soups And milkshakes And pies See It really is all good Now I just need to get my hands on some Pittsburgh Dad smiley cookiesRequest after sitting 10 minutes coffee and eggs well over Coffee came in three minutes Eggs total time 15 minutes COLD Patti has only three tables Nowhere to be found Ahhh here she is Why cant eat n Park after all these years get it right Is it the new generation of ownership just coasting Mr B"

    "review":"Wow So surprised at the one and two star reviews  We started with the most tender calamari Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland but a touch of salt made it just right My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender The mashed potatoes were perfect I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious Our salad was beautiful Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu Our server Matt was right on Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu Our appetizer salad and entrees were timed perfectly I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably I wonder sometimes if people just dont appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal  A wonderful atmosphere So relaxing The chairs are super comfortable too We will certainly be back Give it a try  Dont  always go by the reviews A bottle of Riesling calamari app two delicious entrees and dessert for 92 Well with itMy daughter and I decided to stop in one night before going to the mall The place has completely transformed compared to the last tenant The decor and ambiance is intimate yet friendly My daughter enjoyed her meal so much that she wanted her 8th birthday dinner there The menu is extensive consistent and has gluten free options The food is moderately priced but you receive large portions making it well worth itI dont understand the 2 star reviews Lunch today was very good especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superbSo glad Pazzo is back Now my family has a place to go where we can get delicious gluten free options for some of us and incredible pizza for others  Every time weve eaten here since they reopened we have been treated like family  Our biggest issue is we now have to wait just a minute to be seated because theyre busy but even so the food arrives fresh and hot from the kitchen without waitingAte here last night 112215 with my wife I have to agree with most of the other reviewers in here  Bland  Just very Bland  The price point certainly doesnt match what one would expect  When you drop 20 for farfalle ala vodka with chicken I would expect something with a lot more flavor  I would also expect pieces of Prosciutto as the menu described and a whole chicken breast be used  The salad was good dressing was OK  For an Italian restaurant at this pricepoint one would have expected some nice oliveoil with pepper and cheese for bread not hard butter  Also the gravy was very sweet too sweet for my taste  The atmosphere was nice and I think the place has potential but at this pricepoint and bland food with so many other good Italian places around I will not be backCame here trying a new place Literally Just opened two days ago and well worth it Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess and were told we could even have a seat in the bar Since we were interested in the Pirates game it worked out they have a few TVs in the bar for such purposes We ordered our drinks Prosecco  Malbec Both by the glass Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A there The bread came out first and it was awesome Perfectly warmed large slices crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house Served with ambient temperature butter another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter so AThe salad came out next and was the first area where wed recommend a little change maybe a little larger for sharing between two But it was flavorful cold and dressed just right The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: BNext our entrees: I had the ThreeCheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo sorry if I misspelled it they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild but with a backofthethroat heat which is perfect So: A for his dish My lasagna was rather impressive and I didnt realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna but it was delicious The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade So well worth trying Overall the reason behind the 4star review is only for the slight downsides but again could just be my personal preference I highly recommend coming here to try it out Great ambience and extensive menu"

    "review":"We had a luncheon on Sunday in conjunction with a family event in Oakland Our guests about 30 were given the choice of chicken romano or grilled salmon and both were excellent The service staff was superb attentive and pleasant  and the sales staff who helped us plan it were accessible and accommodating The desert a blueberry cream cake was impressive and delicious I highly recommend them when planning an event in Oakland PittsburghErzatz food Reasonable prices Relaxing atmosphere Quiet Terrible wine list OK for a rainy day if you are staying in the hotel upstairs hungry but are not quite ready to go outI came here for breakfast with my dad when we stayed at the Wyndham Their menu was pretty standard as was the quality of the food Overall the restaurant was rather pricy especially considering that the food wasnt particularly special However its very conveniently located especially if youre staying in the hotelI dont understand why the reviews are so negative Went here twice with my debate team when we were traveling through the airport and both times we loved it Ordered the quesadillas were there The service was fast the tables were nice and the food was really good Not what I expected from an airport restaurantPoor hygiene The wooden corner of the banquette was grimy with the dirt from months of sticky hands which is not removed by the regular but casual wiping with a damp cloth The wooden pepper mill was also grimy and sticky My water glass was not clean The food was adequate and the service was courteous I was surprised and disappointed to find that an egg cup was not available for the softboiled egg I orderedFor a hotel restaurant it is about what you would expect I will give them 3 stars for effort as they really try to make this place better  They tried a lunch buffet which I liked as you had many options but they did away with this Bridges also gives a discount to Pitt employees They have a nice seating area at the bar as well as a covered patio great in the summer Typically they have a nice draft selection and a good happy hour special Working in Oaklamd we stop here every so often for lunch They recently updated their menu to add more healthier options The menu items I recommend are the appetizer quesadilla which are double stuffed and enough for a meal Dont forget to ask for quacamole Another tasty menu item is the spinach dip appetizer and chicken sandwich The chicken sandwich comes on cinnamon toast with cheesethe combo was very tasty What I like is you have a few sides to pick from including fruit chips or fries I highly recommend the fresh fruit option Entrees I do not recommend are the salads and the chicken wrap  The service is slow even though it is never usually busy in there so be prepared"

    "review":"One of my favorite places to get a bagel The crew was distracted but polite My food was well made and the dining area was clean and orderly Just what you crave downtown during rush hourThe girls that work here do not have any customer service experience and no training it pretty much seems like they just walked in from the outside and put aprons on  Seriously the worst Brueggers Bagel place ever I love Brueggers but if this would have been my first experience with them I would have never gone in a Brueggers place again  I understand that they may be new and dont know how to make the items on the menu but at least have a smile on your face and warm energy  They need helpIve only been here for breakfast so Ill review thatThis place is mediocre in every sense of the word I decided to go a second time just to try a different item on the menu sort of a second chance I remain disappointed The service: bland They are less than enthusiastic I dont expect employees to be absolutely stoked to serve me bagels but its as though Im some burden on their life Hardly any eye contact Theyre all limp tired and annoyed Just a bad attitude to start off I assume this has something to do with management to an extent Its as if these people REALLY hate their job I worked in food service for six years and even though most dont plan on being in food service forever there can still be good vibes at a restaurant but I digressThe food: The bagels are dry and a little tough Egg is just what you would get at a McDonalds I wasnt expecting anything fancy but just a heads up You can see them add this rubbery egg disc to your sandwich slap a few other ingredients on unevenly and pop it in the warming machine The cheese is also rubbery As I said before I wasnt expecting gourmet but this place is complete crap Just go somewhere elseIve been loyally eating brueggers bagels since I moved to Pittsburgh but in the last few months service has plummeted I wait for at least 15 min when there is one person in front of me and nobody seems to know what is going on Im very disappointed and will likely be converting to EinsteinI am to this day not sure why but I love the taragon chicken salad sandwich on an everything bagel from Brueggers  Perhaps its a childhood memory but its definitely my version of a comfort food  The consistency of the cranberry chicken salad is a bit more fluid than that found in other bagel cafes but I actually like how the creamy semiliquid seeps into the bagel like a mayo spread  Plus I get an extra schmear of mayo on the bagel who said it was healthy  The cranberries interspersed throughout gave it a nice hint of sweetness which pairs well with the savory bagel and the chicken salad itself  Ask for lettuce tomatoes and onions  It was a treat for me since we dont really have this chain in Phila or NYC anymore and this was always my goto  I am also a fan of their asiago parmesan bagel which comes with a nice thick layer of cheese  Their bagels have a nice crust and dense soft inside too unlike Paneras which are more breadlike  Decent service and a nice selection of coffee flavors as wellI was very happy with my visit here the other morning Its a cute little bagel shop with a modern retro feel a decent amount of seating booths and tables a clean peaceful atmosphere and super friendly  quick service Oh and they have restrooms a necessity for us coffee guzzlers I got the whole wheat bagel with maple walnut cream cheese on one side and bacon scallion on the other since I had a terrible mental debate deciding between the two A rather fine bagel I must say Very wholesome The maple walnut cream cheese is delicately sweet and has tiny walnut chunks in it a pleasant surpriseThe coconut coffee a seasonal flavor was deliciously flavored and was brewed pretty strongdark which I like Perfect with some milk1 star amiss just for the lack of coffee condiments and that the coffee isnt selfserve Einstein Bros around the corner has all their coffee out on the bar so you can try every flavor and go back for seconds along with spices for your tea and coffee I wouldve loved to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to my coconut coffee and refill it multiple times at Brueggers but def not a big deal I would so go backrecommend to all bagel lovers A great fairly inexpensive 170 for coffee in your own thermos place for breakfastlunch with friends or even your jolly ol self"

    "review":"Excellent genuine Italian restaurant I love the intimate atmosphere The fresh bread always comes directly out of the oven to your table The prices are extremely reasonable for nicely sized portions It also means a lot to me when the owner takes the time to talk to his customers On our last visit he asked where we were from if we were satisfied etc I will absolutely be backSarafinos is a lively but cozy place with a pleasant ambiance and good food  I appreciate that the offerings are purposely prepared in a straightforward manner and not made with 11000 ingredientsjust old world Italian cooking is all I had the special for the eveningtwo crab cakes with a house salad and a healthysized portobello mushroom Those crab cakes were so much better than anything I have gotten in the Chesapeake Bay area in quite some time they were light and lovely and delectableMy hub had the linguine and white clam sauce I tried itit was to die forA highlypleasing cappuccino for an afterdinner treat was only 295  Say whatAs if it couldnt get any better when owner Joe Caliguire was making the rounds in the dining room and found out that we hailed from the nations capital he comped us free dessert  We got the tiramisu cake and almond creme horn and were they smooth smooth smooth babyThis is a peach of restaurant  I should have bussed Mr Caliguire on the cheek but demurred  I coulda given the wrong impression and then got the local people gossipin and all that since I never met the man beforeNo wonder he got restaurateur of the year awhile back  He understands both food and people and how to treat them very wellPittsburghyou are lucky and I am jealousThis is our second time here and it is really good Great pasta dishes Small menu and small dining area but pasta sauces have BIG flavor A very relaxed small town Italian place with the atmosphere of a New York City hole in the walland that is meant in a good wayFood was exceptional Went there a couple weeks ago The place is small but has great ambiance  It is pricey but worth it  Only issue is when you get there you walk right through the dining area and must wait for a seat by the bar  My only complaint was that the waitress was overwhelmed and forgot to offer drinks of any kind    Other than that I would highly recommend the restaurantA go to restaurant in Crafton  Yes  You have to know where it is and how to get there but once you do it is definitely worth it  You know something is going to be good when you walk in and you are only about 5 feet from the kitchen where the chef is pounding and pounding away on fresh vealMy wife and I love good Italian food and after Francos in Dormont closed we were depressed  But alas we found a replacementIts a small place but so are most of the great Italian restaurants on Mulberry St in New York City so get over it  The food is great except the soup I ordered the Pasta Fagioli it was loaded with beans and pasta but the broth was watery and bland not my first choice that is the only reason I gave 4 stars vs 5  BUUUUT everything else was absolutely excellent  The Bruschetta was excellent which included an Italian salad in the center Pasta with red clam sauce Fettuccine with Oglio and grilled chicken Veal Parmesan over linguine and fresh bread hot out of a very very old pizza oven with a classic oil dipping sauceFor the quality of food and large portions the pricing is reasonableIf they had tables outside on the sidewalk it would be just like Little Italy in New YorkAn excellent spot for dinner I was genuinely pleased with both the service and the food during my visitCant wait to head back to this place on my next visit to Pittsburgh"

    "review":"New decor is very nice Service and food are above average but not great Prices are a bit high but I guess you pay for the view Wine prices are way too high for mediocre options Great place to showcase the city but Off the Hook is much betterI thought it was exciting news when our neighborhood seafood restaurant with the best views of Pittsburgh decided to remodel and add a sushi bar We decided to go check it out on a Saturday night Unfortunately the dinner turned into a comedy of errors: a tray of water glasses was spilled over Joe and our neighboring tables guests the 20 appetizer we ordered was served at room temp I received the wrong wine and finally when it came time to pay our 90 bill I was mistakenly charged triple that amount and the manager had to void it out Although they did provide a free round of drinks for the water incident I felt that for such a nice restaurant we should have received better customer service The positives Pretty good sushi rolls and a fantastic view of the city Wanted to enjoy this local spot but will likely not be returningI have really grown to love Pittsburgh and one reason is because we never have anything planned and somehow manage to see a live performance or have a great meal spontaneously Of course saying this Ive now jinxed myself  So last night went to Sakari It was a rainy cool night Monterey Bay was packed by the way new neutral decor very similar to Altius and Off The Hook  Sakaris sushi bar is located down the stairs and to the back of the restaurant in the rear right corner  There are windows on both sides and it is a dark romantic  sleek space  There is rare privacy to talk to your group or companion but also the staff are super friendly  The sushi was beyond phenomenal I am not one to give compliments and  have never liked sushi  which is why I am writing Had planned to order from the Monterey Bay menu but the sushi chefs itamae were fun the food looked great so why not We had the Sakari Roll 16  tempura  light delicious The Phipps Roll 10 all vegetables and fruits insanely good The Grotto 12 salmon and crab not fried still phenomenal The steamed dumplings also filling but not heavy  Our waitress was not exactly available but the sushi chefs more than made upIt was noisy but not overwhelming The attire was dressy  There were several people in suits checking on tables and bussing tables Since there is the option of both menus salads desserts and Montereys famous crab cakes make this a great new spotOh my goodnesswhere do I begin I guess I should be positive first the restaurant inside is beautiful and sexy The view is beautiful The music and lighting are perfect and based on all of this we expected Nobu but what we got was horrific and worse than something youd get at the airport For starters it took an hour to get our oysters which smelled like a fish tank I ate them because I was starving and my husband ate 5 out of the 6 saying the last one smelled too bad to eat The challenge now was getting someone to clear the plates The smell began to overwhelm us and we resorted to survival tactics taught to us by our catsburry it We started burying the empty oysters with whatever leftover garnish we could find in an attempt to save ourselves In addition it was also freezing in the restaurant so we had to drink hot tea in an effort to not get frost bite and getting hot water seemed to be problematic for them Id like to add that Im really confused as to why places in Pittsburgh cant get their airconditioning set to a normal temperaturemeat locker is NOT a setting  Finally once the hot water and sparkling water came the server left and he left his tray on a chair at our table After about 15 minutes my husband stood up and opened the bottle of sparkling water himself pretended he was a server and very properly poured my sparkling water While it was highly entertaining and I was laughing it really wasnt funny Next up were some handrolls we ordered without rice guess what Yepall 6 were filled with rice so we sent those back Another 20 minutes rolls by and our octopus sashimi and salmon sashimi arrive both items are cut waaaay too thick Eating a thicker cut of salmon sashimi is at least possible and not completely awful the salmon was good quality and fresh but was just cut too thick but octopus cut improperly is an entirely different game My husband described it as a chew toy for the cats or the equivalent of shoving an entire pack of old Bubble Yum into your mouth and its so hard and so chewy that it makes your jaw hurt So that was spit into a napkin after he got lock jaw lets just call this an EPIC FAIL After 25 hours the only other edible item was the Thunderbolt roll which they did make riceless and with soy paper for us  Let me just say that I really want this place to be good I really want it  Im hoping that my review will actually propel them into greatness so that I can go back and enjoy the gorgeous remodel and view and actually eat and enjoy dinner  Needless to say we both left basically hungry and they were kind and took care of our bill due to the comedy of errors BUT my stomach was on the fritz that night and the next day  I wasnt full blown sick but something was off and my bets are on the smelly oysters for causing that disturbance  If you want to see the remodel and the view eat upstairsweve had great meals in the main dining roomI was fortunate to have gone to the Table Magazine happy hour tasting and overall I was pretty impressed with Sakaris offerings The one downside of the tasting was that many of the items up for grabs werent on the actual menu so we ended up ordering a few extra items to get a more accurate idea of what Sakari was up to Overall the atmosphere is excellent Would it be so nice without the incredible view of the city Im not sure but the restaurant is very modern and uses a dark palette throughout which works fine since theres so much light from the windows The service was soso and probably the real down point of the experience Perhaps it was the free tasting concept in the wait staffs mind but many people were still ordering food off of the regular menu we spent 90 on two rolls the grilled cheese small plate and a glass of  13 ros so Im not sure why the waiterswaitresses seemed so disinterested I wouldve been even more disappointed if this was the service provided say on a romantic evening when the bill would quickly escalate to the 120150 range They were fast to clear the table but it was almost disruptive as the staff continually interrupted conversations reached over us for plates while we werent quite finished and even spilled stuff on my wifes purse Really made for a meh experienceThe food though was goodI think Im torn as Monterey Bay promotes their use of fresh fish and the fish used WAS wonderful but the sushi rolls were sort of victims of trying so hard to be unique that the fish becomes a backdrop to the other 5 ingredients in each roll We tried about a dozen things from fishfocused rolls and savory wagyu rolls to dessert rolls and almost all of them suffered from this If Im being honest my favorite item from the evening was the sashimi It was meltinyourmouth good Which is probably why I walked away feeling like the rest of the rolls were overthought If you have access to such incredible cuts of fish why disguise the quality for the sake of trying to fit every flavor profile imaginable in each roll Dont get me wrong the rolls were all tasty but if you pay 20 on a roll I think Id prefer to taste what Im really paying for: the fish Presentation though is spoton so the chefs certainly arent slacking behind the bar The two nonsushi things that we tried were the dumplings and the grilled cheese small plate The dumplings were awesome with a pork sausage filling and a sweet sauce lining the plate I was a bit surprised by how large the portion was as well The grilled cheese was good but I probably wouldnt get again Its simply too filling and the stomach space would be better spent on the sushfish optionsAllinall Sakari has loads of potential The atmosphere and view are sensational The staff is okay but could use work on reading their customers needs the bussing of the tables was disruptive but they at least kept waters topped off and giving off a more positive vibeepecially for the type of bills theyre handing to customers Perhaps most importantly the food is creative  almost to a fault  and delicious so lets hope they pull everything together and make Sakari a top restaurant in experience and not just elevation"

    "review":"I ordered wings online from Wing Stop  I went to the restaurant to pick them up 5 minutes before they were supposed to be ready  I showed the cashier my credit card and ID and signed the paper  I sat down in the restaurant to wait for my wings  20 minutes later my wing order still hadnt been called so I went to the counter to see what was going on  Not only were my wings not ready they hadnt been started and no one knew about the order  They couldnt find the order and instead of figuring out what was wrong with my order the cashier started helping other customers   The wings are good but the service is not  I wont return with so many other options in south side that are as good or better with much better serviceIve been looking for a place with reasonably priced wings and Ive finally found it They have a wide delivery range which came in handy since I usually cant get anything I want brought to my door The food was excellent I got Smokey BBQ and Mango Habanero bone in wings and was utterly ecstatic with the flavor and quality of the meatIf I remain in their delivery area I will definitely order againI was not happy with my first experience at this Wingstop I showed up here about 11 oclock on a Friday night to grab some wings to go There were 3 employees working with 3 other people sitting down eating when I got here I placed an order for 18 wingsabout 2000 There was no one else waiting on anything and it took me about 30 minutes to get my wings The wings were ok Not great not bad The flavors were the same They were a little soggy and didnt have much of that crisp outside juicy inside that I like I wish I would have just ordered wings to go from a bar on the Southside instead of this place I wont be returningOrdered wing stop for delivery and not only did it show up super fast it was delicious The boneless wings were very meaty and the hickory smoked BBQ was just the right amount of kick The ranch is homemade and mixes great with the BBQ But my favorite part of the meal had to be the very delicious southern sweet tea Tastes just like I was placed in the Carolinas on a hot summer dayNot really worth it I got an 8 piece boneless wing for 8 and they were really smallThe people working here are rude but the food is good enough to keep you coming back wings are tasty crispy and saucy but nothing too extraordinary Where they really shine is in the sides potato salad and baked beans are amazing The seasoned fries are pretty nomworthy as well"
